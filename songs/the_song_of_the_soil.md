**[Intro]**
(Acoustic guitar strums softly. The sound of wind blowing through eucalyptus leaves.)
(Cooroo speaks softly over the music)
They built the walls high.
They filled the air with noise.
They told you that you have to pay just to stand.
But the ground... the ground is older than the money.
And the ground is asking a question.
Listen.

**[Verse 1]**
Trumbat paved the garden with a heavy stone
He said, "Stay inside, you'll never be alone."
Muskbat filled the silence with a buzzing sound
So you couldn't hear the heartbeat of the ground.
Vitabat is collecting every single debt
Telling you that freedom is something you gotta get.
Tatebat is pointing at the ceiling made of gold
But he never looks down at the story being told.
Zuckbat is watching with his eyes in the vine
Recording every secret that was yours and mine.
They severed the connection, they cut the Seventh Thread
They built a city for the living that is ruling like the dead.

**[Chorus]**
(Soaring, melodic hook with harmonies)
But Arnamland is not a place you own
It’s a seed that was planted before the throne.
It doesn’t ask for your title or your name
It doesn’t care about your fortune or your fame.
The only law that the ancient ones set...
Is simply this: **Are you keeping the soil wet?**
Are you keeping the soil wet?
(Are you tending?)
Are you keeping the soil wet?

**[Verse 2]**
The Wattle went deep, drilling for the source
But the poison came down and it changed the course.
Now the Jacaranda blooms in the grey and the dust
A stranger in the land, earning the trust.
We don’t need a pedigree to hold the earth
We just need the labor to prove our worth.
Belonging isn't heritage, belonging is a verb
It's the paw in the clay, it's the peace in the curb.
So let the Wall crumble, let the Ledger burn
Let the seasons of the fire and the rain return.
You are not a tenant, you are not a slave
You are the water that the thirsty roots crave.

**[Bridge]**
(Music swells, percussion builds)
Look down! (Look down!)
Past the glow and the screen!
Look down! (Look down!)
At the spaces in between!
The crack in the grout is a door to the truth
The mud is the memory of your eternal youth!
Don't listen to the Frequency, listen to the hum
The vibration of the Kingdom that is yet to come!

**[Chorus]**
'Cause Arnamland is not a place you own
It’s a seed that was planted before the throne.
It doesn’t ask for your title or your name
It doesn’t care about your fortune or your fame.
The only law that the ancient ones set...
Is simply this: **Are you keeping the soil wet?**
Are you keeping the soil wet?
(Are you tending?)
Are you keeping the soil wet?

**[Outro]**
(Guitar fades to just the sound of rain falling on dry earth)
Yeah.
Not "Where are you from?"
Not "What do you owe?"
Just... are you tending?
The answer is in your hands.
(Soft bird call)
Keep it wet.
(Fade out)
