**[Intro: Deep Pipe Organ Pedal (C2). Slow, rising string arpeggios simulating the spiral of the light beam. The atmosphere is vast and reverberant.]**

**[Verse 1: Tenors & Basses - Heavy, Chant-like]**
De Profundis Arnam clamavi.
(Out of the Deep Arnam, I have cried.)
From the root, from the dark, from the closing node.
The world bends, the world bends.
O Nico, O Nico, Lux Aeterna.
(O Nico, O Nico, Eternal Light.)

**[Verse 2: Sopranos & Altos - Fast, Fluttering Counterpoint]**
Ascendit! Ascendit!
(Rise! Rise!)
See the Red Wing, see the Blue Spark.
Not the Galah, not the Lark.
We are the Blood of the Beam.
Rubra Penna, Caerulea Ala.
(Red Feather, Blue Wing.)
To the Gold, to the Crown, to the Wattle's Dream.

**[Chorus: Full Choir - Complex Polyphony, Voices Overlapping]**
The Curve is the Law, the Curve is the Way...
(We fly through the night to become the Day...)
The Static is broken, the Glass is the Shield...
(The Grout cannot hold us, the Wall must yield...)

**[Bridge: Massive Orchestral Swell - Trumpets and Timpani enter]**
Gloria in Excelsis Acacia!
(Glory to the Wattle in the Highest!)
The Yellow Sun, the Living Bloom.
We leave the Shadow, we leave the Tomb.
The Heart is Hollow, but the Light is Full.
The Star is Pushing, but the Roots will Pull.

**[Solo: High Soprano - Pure, Piercing Tone]**
Et Lux Perpetua...
(And Perpetual Light...)
I touch the pollen. I drink the dust.
In the Geometry, we place our trust.
The Space Between is where we sing.
Compassion is the lifting wing.

**[Outro: Massive Block Chords, Slow and Final]**
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus.
(Holy, Holy, Holy.)
The Wattle. The Watcher. The Way.
Arnam.
Arnam.
A-men.

**[Fade Out: The Organ chord sustains for 10 seconds, fading into the sound of wings flapping.]**
