(Drum roll)

**[Verse 1: Big Red - The Ice Cube Flow]**
Straight outta Arnam!
Crazy hopper named Big Red
From the gang called Game Meat, born and bred
When I kick off, I knock your tick off
Flex the muscle, and bodies are hauled off
You too, Joey, if you luck with me
The High-Nose Council gonna hafta come and get me
Off your borow, that's how I'm goin' out
For the punk mother-wombats that's showin' out
Runnin' start, and then I start stompin'
Hopping through the plains like I'm hopping through Compton
When I pounce, I'm ready to bounce
Crush a Koala flat, ounce by ounce
That's how it goes, the Static is the fuel
Mess with the 'Roo, and you breaking the rule
Rappin' to the Dingo, and I'm looking for the snout
(Chorus: *Yo, what's that gang all about?*)
We "The Game Meat", yelling it out!

**[Chorus]**
(Scratching and heavy brass hits)
(Chant)
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "Crazy mother-hopper!")
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "More-more-more territory!")
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "Static-Static-Static Logic!")

**[Verse 2: Ren-Roo - The MC Ren Flow]**
Straight outta Arnam!
Another crazy brother
More territory and I'm takin' from the other
Yo, I'm bad, and I'm hopping real low
If you ain't Game Meat, then you gotta go
I'm a sniper, staring at the line
Any dirt I see, yeah, that dirt is mine
Ruthless, never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload, see the spark
You see a Hopper? You better duck
'Cause Big Ren-Roo is crazy as... (truck!)
I don't give a damn, I don't give a toss
I'm the surface ruler, I'm the Arnam boss
Static in the brain, data in the vein
Driving the High-Noses utterly insane
So if you see me on the track, don't stop
I'm straight outta Arnam, ruling the Static!

**[Chorus]**
(Scratching and heavy brass hits)
(Chant)
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "Crazy mother-hopper!")
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "More-more-more territory!")
Straight outta Arnam!
(Sample: "Static-Static-Static Logic!")

**[Verse 3: Eazy-Roo - The Eazy-E Flow]**
(High pitched, manic delivery)
Straight outta Arnam!
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous, hopping to the beat
Scanning the ground, don't look at my feet
I'm a menace to society, a Static addict
High-Nose Council claiming that I'm problematic
Without a gun, I'm taking what I want
Kick in the door, pulling up to the front
I'm lurking, working, jerking the line
Crossing the border, making it mine
So what about the borow that you hiding in?
I'll stomp the roof down, cave it all in!
This is the gang, and we bringing the noise
The Game Meat posse, the Westside boys!

**[Outro]**
(Beat breaks down. Heavy breathing.)
(Spoken)
Yeah.
Straight Outta Arnam.
Game Meat.
Westside.
We rule the surface.
Don't forget it.
(Echoing: "Damn, that shit was dope!")
(Fade out with sirens)
