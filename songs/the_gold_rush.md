## 💿 Version 1: The Cultural Architect (English)

[Intro]
(Minimalist bouncy beat kicks in—Get Em High style. A funky slap bass joins after 4 bars—Hypnotize style.)
(Tatebat talks over the beat with manic ad-libs)
Yeah.
N-n-now-n-now!
Vision, Vision, Vision, can't you see?
Sometimes your design just hypnotize me.
But I'm the one designing the hypnosis!
Wake up, Mr. Westside!
It's the Celebration, baby!
(Heavy orchestral stab)

[Verse 1]
It was all a dream!
I used to read Architecture magazine!
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine!
Digging in the dirt, knuckles bleeding on the wall
Every single day, just waiting for the call.
I let my fur rock 'til my fur popped!
Smoking Lyptus on the corner while the bodies dropped!
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match!
N-n-now I'm designing the latch!
We went from negative to positive!
And it's all good!
Selling the Safety to the neighborhood!
I took the hustle and I turned it into Art
Every brick in the wall is a piece of my heart.
I didn't force 'em to dig, I gave 'em the reason
To survive the winter and the killing season!
Now we in the limelight, cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade!

[Chorus]
(Hypnotic G-Funk Bassline + Tatebat Manic Ad-libs)
This is the Gold Rush, baby, touch the sky!
(N-n-now-n-now-now!)
We painting over everything that passes by!
I want the shine, I want the fame, I want the Art!
Every digger in the tunnel got a piece of my heart!
(Vision, Vision!)
I bring the glory to the name, looking at the view
While the future bright as silk is waiting for you!
Used to be dust, now we living in the plush
Caught up in the feeling of the Gold Rush!

[Verse 2]
Melborow's Finest, Sega Genesis!
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this!
50-inch screen, money green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur!
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, Zuckbat handles that!
And the whole crew is lounging
Celebrating every day, no more scrounging!
Are you kidding me? You talking 'bout the soil?
I'm talking 'bout the gold and the fruits of the toil!
I put the pressure on the Dingoes in the West
Put the 'S' on my chest and let the signal manifest!
I’m the Cultural Architect, designing the fate
Thinking back on my one-room shack!
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back!
And she loves to show me off, of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source!
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us!
Birthdays was the worst days!
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay!

[Bridge]
(Funky bass breakdown with cinematic strings)
If you ain't got the vision, then you ain't got the life.
I turned the struggle into a beautiful wife.
I turned the cage into a gallery space.
I’m elevating the consciousness of the entire race!
(N-n-now-n-now!)

[Outro]
(Hypnotize bassline fades out with manic Kanye ad-libs)
We made it!
From the dirt to the Masterpiece!
It's all Design!
Even the lies are Art!
Cultural Architect!
Melborow's Finest in the veins!
Safety in the brain!
(Echo fades)

## 🧧 Version 2: The Triad Cut (Cantonese Mix)

[Intro]
(Minimalist bouncy beat. Funky slap bass.)
係。(Yeah.)
N-n-now-n-now!
遠見, 遠見, 遠見, 你知唔知？(Vision, Vision, Vision, don't you know?)
有時你嘅設計真係令我着迷。(Sometimes your design just hypnotize me.)
但我先至係設計緊嗰個！(But I'm the one designing it!)
醒啦，Mr. Westside!
(Heavy orchestral stab)

[Verse 1]
以前只係一個夢！(It was all a dream!)
我以前成日睇 Architecture 雜誌！
(Remember digging deep, knuckles bleeding)
我由得我啲毛搖，搖到爆晒！
喺條街轉角食住 Lyptus，睇住啲屍體跌落嚟！
以前我有件紅黑格仔外套，
仲有頂帽襯返埋！
而家我設計緊個鎖！
我哋由負面變做正面！
全部都係好嘢！
賣緊 Safety 畀成個街坊！
我拎起掙扎，將佢變做藝術
牆上面每一舊磚，都係我嘅心。
我冇迫佢哋挖，我畀咗個原因佢哋
去過呢個冬天同埋殺戮季節！
而家我哋喺聚光燈下面，因為我 Rap 得好
係時候攞錢，好似世貿咁爆發！

[Chorus]
(Hypnotic Bassline)
呢個係淘金熱，寶貝，摸到個天！
我哋髹過所有經過嘅嘢！
我要光榮，我要名利，我要藝術！
隧道入面個個都有我嘅心！
我要帶光榮畀個名，望向風景
前程似錦等緊你！
以前係塵埃，而家住得富貴
陶醉喺淘金熱嘅感覺！

[Verse 2]
Melborow's Finest，Sega Genesis！
當我窮到燶嗰陣，真係想像唔到！
五十吋銀幕，草綠色皮梳化
有兩架車，有司機嘅豪華房車！
電話費大約兩千蚊
唔使驚，Zuckbat 會搞掂！
成班兄弟喺度享受
每日都喺度慶祝，唔使再乞！
有冇搞錯？你同我講泥土？
我講緊黃金同埋辛勞嘅成果！
我畀壓力西邊嗰班 Dingo
將個 'S' 字放喺心口，等個訊號顯現！
我係文化建築師，設計緊命運
諗返起我以前住嗰間一房爛屋！
而家我老母揸住部 Ac，着住貂皮！
佢好鍾意騷我出嚟，當然啦
每次我上 The Source 封面佢都笑！
以前地主鬧我哋，我哋會吵大鑊
冇暖氣，諗緊點解聖誕節冇咗！
生日係最衰嘅日子！
而家我哋口渴就飲香檳！

[Outro]
(Bassline fades)
搞掂！
由爛地變傑作！
全部係設計！
大話都係藝術！
文化建築師！
Melborow's Finest 喺血管入面！
Safety 喺個腦入面！
(Echo fades)
