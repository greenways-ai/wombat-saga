**[Intro: Beatbox rhythm kicks in, acoustic guitar strums fast, upbeat chord progression. Cooroo’s voice is crisp and urgent.]**

The Star is the source and the Root is the feed
Each and every day I dig to plant the Violet Seed
I want to be deep in you, yes I’m so hungry
You’re like Arnam for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without the Flow there’s no me
You’re the pattern I see
Sometimes the Glass is thin and I just can't breathe
With these, Static clouds all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I’ll stand on the ridge-line
Won't be bought by the mine
Fight with all of my might and get the shadows to re-align
Nico's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of Grey comes the Gold, from the Grout into the mold
Shattered Gorge burnin' up with the stories that were told
Said, thank you to the Sphere, now I finally got it clear
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and get the Galahs to hear!

**[Chorus: Explosive energy, melodic and soaring]**
What’s this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to the Curve from the essence of my being
Sing to the Star all these songs of love and healing
Want the Arnam now so it's time we start revealing
What’s this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to the Curve from the essence of my being
Sing to the Star all these songs of love and healing
Want the Arnam now!

**[Verse 2: Fast, percussive flow]**
Strip away the Grout and reveal your Glass
Got to give yourself up and let the frequencies pass
You’re a slave to the Flat and you don’t even know
You want to build a high tower but your roots don't grow
If you’re trying to stay rigid then you're bound to crack, bro
You want the Light but you can’t deflate your ego
If you think you're at the top then there's nowhere to go
If your borow's all full then it's bound to overflow
If you’re drowning in the Static and you can’t stay afloat
Ask the Wombat for a tunnel and he’ll throw you a rope
You’re looking for the edge but you say it can't be found
Looking up to the smog and searchin' beneath the ground
Like a Heart without a Sound
Yes, you keep fallin' down
You really want to fly but you're chained to the town
Tried to reach unto the peaks and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and then you heard a sound
Out of Spin comes the Press and out of Press comes the Light
Nullified to the Core like a bird in the flight,
Makin' room for the Space where the Compassion is bright
Makin' room for the Space where the Compassion is bright!

**[Chorus: Maximum volume, joyous liberation]**
What’s this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to the Curve from the essence of my being
Sing to the Star all these songs of love and healing
Want the Arnam now so it's time we start revealing
What’s this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
Givin' myself to the Curve from the essence of my being
Sing to the Star all these songs of love and healing
Want the Arnam now!

**[Bridge: Tempo slows slightly, Yidaki drone intensifies under the guitar]**
And see, I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I see it circling around from the Mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
The Wattle keeps my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed
When I look to the Curve where my help come from
And I see it circling around from the Mountain
Thunder!
You feel it in your chest
The Wombat keeps my mind at ease and my soul at rest
You're not vexed!

**[Outro: Fast scatting/beatboxing fading into a single, pure whistle of the Morning Glory]**
Ya-da-da-di-da-da... The Glass is the shield...
Ya-da-da-di-da-da... The Static will yield...
Honor the Soil.
Keep the Symmetry.
(Whistle)
