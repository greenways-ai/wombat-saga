[Intro] (Instrumental: A deep Yidaki drone pulses. The sound of wind blowing through dry grass. A soft, rhythmic beatbox starts, steady as a heartbeat.) (Spoken: "Arnamland belongs to itself. We are just the breath. Clear the static. Listen.")

[Chorus] Jacaranda, if I forget you Fire not gonna come from me tongue Jacaranda, if I forget you Let my right wing forget what it’s supposed to do Jacaranda, if I forget you Fire not gonna come from me tongue Jacaranda, if I forget you Let my right wing forget what it’s supposed to do

[Verse 1] (Flow: Measured, rhythmic chanting) In the ancient days, we will return with no delay Godkind walking in the blossoms on our way We've been flying from state to state And the Static tries to hide the narrow gate Cycle after cycle with no branch to be They want the animals to leave the milk and honey Don't you see? It's not about the land or the sea Not the world, but the dwelling of the Majesty!

[Chorus] Jacaranda, if I forget you Fire not gonna come from me tongue Jacaranda, if I forget you Let my right wing forget what it’s supposed to do

[Verse 2] (More urgent, percussive) Rebuild the temple and the crown of glory The soil is old, yeah, it’s a sacred story Burn in the oven of the Static of the century The noise tried to choke but it couldn't choke me I will not lie down, I will not fall asleep The Animals are waking and the truth is deep Erase the spirits out of our memory? Cut off the roots of the family tree? Don't you know that's not the way to be? The rent is care—give it back to the Majesty!

[Bridge] (Beatbox breakdown—very natural and organic) If I forget the Truth, then my words won't penetrate Static burning in the place, can't see through the haze Chop down all of them dirty ways That's the price that you pay for selling lies to the youth! Ain't no one gonna break my stride Got to keep on moving Stay alive.

[Chorus] Jacaranda, if I forget you Fire not gonna come from me tongue Jacaranda, if I forget you Let my right wing forget what it’s supposed to do

[Outro] (Fading Yidaki drone and soft bird calls) It belongs to itself. Godkind... Animals... The Jacaranda... (SFX: Soft rustle of petals falling on dry stone)
