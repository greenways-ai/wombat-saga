**[Intro]**
(Instrumental: Iconic high-pitched G-Funk synth melody glides in. Heavy funk bass line drops.)
(Spoken: Smooth, sleepy voice)
Yeah...
(Inhales deeply)
Ha ha ha.
Used to be a Prime, baby.
Now we just in the prime of our life.
Drop-Bears in the canopy.
We don't need the crown.
We got the leaves.
This one goes out to the ones that know...
(Synth flourish)

**[Verse 1]**
With so much drama in the Greater Arnamland
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop-K-O-A-L-A
Just another day in the Greater Arnamland
Where the Static-pits rot and the Primes decay
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass Lyptus like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the 'roos (yeah)
And, make a few Arnam-coins as I cruise (yeah)
Two in the mornin', got the drop-bear stare
Valet parking at the gum-tree, comb my ear-hair
I got the fiends in the living room gettin' it on
And, they ain't leavin' 'til six in the morn' (six in the morn')
So what you wanna do?
I got a pocket full of leaves and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't care about the laws (yeah!)
So we gonna smoke a leaf with you
'Cause that's just what a Drop-Bear do.

**[Chorus]**
(Melodic, catchy hook)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)

**[Verse 2]**
Now that the sun is up, I'm lookin' at the view
I see a frantic little animal and a Dingo too
I'm gettin' paid, I'm gettin' high
Watchin' the "Game Meat" hop on by
I got a stash in the hollow, a stash in the root
I got a fresh grey fur suit, lookin' cute
The Primes are history, the Wattle is dead
But I got a different kind of garden in my head
When the world starts shaking and the ground gets cold
You need the Eucalyptus that's worth its weight in gold
I take a bite, I take a chew
Next thing you know, I'm floatin' higher than you
So step back, relax, let the feeling creep
The Drop-Bears run the city while the others sleep
Yeah...

**[Chorus]**
(Melodic, catchy hook)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)

**[Bridge]**
(Music breaks down to bass and drums)
I got the potent.
I got the sticky.
The Wattle fell... but the Lyptus rose.
We traded our nobility for the chemistry.
And business is blooming.
(Exhales smoke)

**[Chorus]**
(Melodic, catchy hook)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)
Rollin' down the branch, smokin' Lyptus leaves
Laid back (with my mind on my Arnam and my Arnam on my mind)

**[Outro]**
(Synth melody plays out. Ad-libs fading)
Yeah.
Drop-Bears.
Lyptus Gang.
Westside Canopy.
Don't fall asleep under the tree...
Or we might drop on ya.
(Ha ha ha...)
(Music fades)
