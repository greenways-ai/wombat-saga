# The Five Borows of Melborow

**"One City, Five Pits, Ten Million Shovels."**
— *Melborow Tourism Slogan (Struck through with graffiti)*

Melborow is not a single hole; it is a sprawling subterranean megalopolis divided into five distinct administrative districts (The Borows). Each borow represents a different layer of the "Dead System" and is personified by its local Sovereign.

## 1. Melborow Central (The Core)
*The Manhattan of Arnamland*

*   **Sovereign:** **Trumbat** (The Priest/Landlord).
*   **Landscape:** The "Grid." Tunnels here are perfectly square with flat crowns and dish-shaped inverts, poured in High-Tensile Safety Grout. No springline curvature—just ninety-degree angles that crack under shear stress. The skyline is dominated by the **Cathedral of the Frequency**.
*   **Function:** Law, Religion, and Real Estate. This is where the High-Nose elite live in "Vertical Borows"—apartments that stack miles high into the substrate.
*   **Vibe:** Aggressive, expensive, and blindingly lit by synthetic "Glow-Panels."

## 2. Queensborow (The Sprawl)
*The Queens of Arnamland*

*   **Sovereign:** **Tatebat** (The Influencer/Pimp).
*   **Landscape:** A chaotic, multi-layered maze of residential tunnels and "Social Mining" rigs. It is the most densely populated borow.
*   **Function:** Luxury, Status, and Mirror-Work. This is the heart of the "Pre-Dug" market. Wombats here don't dig; they trade "Social Equity" for larger voids.
*   **Vibe:** Flashy, crowded, and loud. The air smells of cheap perfume and expensive Lyptus.

## 3. Brookborow (The Grotto)
*The Brooklyn of Arnamland*

*   **Sovereign:** **Muskbat** (The Tech/Disruptor).
*   **Landscape:** Old industrial tunnels being "disrupted" by neon-lit tech hubs. It contains the **Gray Grotto**—the working-class district where **Hoebat** and his kin reside. Unlined tunnels with sagging crowns, weeping walls, and clogged sumps. The Council calls it "perimeter redistribution" when the water comes through the seepage walls.
*   **Function:** Innovation, Hardware, and the "Glow Room" (Server Farms).
*   **Vibe:** Gentrifying. A mix of grimy "Old Way" masonry and sleek, humming Muskbat hardware. Home to the "Hipster Diggers" who drink artisanal seep-water.

## 4. Bronxborow (The Hard Earth)
*The Bronx of Arnamland*

*   **Sovereign:** **Vitabat** (The Auditor/Enforcer).
*   **Landscape:** Rough, unpolished sandstone and deep, reinforced bunkers. The tunnels here are built for defense and durability—thick buttresses at the springline, crowned arches that flex under pressure rather than shattering. The Dingo Packs know how to read a tunnel's stress fractures.
*   **Function:** The Vaults. This is where the **Liquid Ledger** servers are kept. It is the center of debt-collection and physical enforcement.
*   **Vibe:** Gritty, dangerous, and honest. This is **Pokero's** primary stomping ground—the place where the Dingo gangs and the Wombat laborers share a mutual, violent understanding of the world.

## 5. Statborow (The Reach)
*The Staten Island of Arnamland*

*   **Sovereign:** **Zuckbat** (The Ledger/Omniscience).
*   **Landscape:** Isolated from the main city by the **Shattered Gorge** (The Narrows). It is a suburban, sprawling landscape of "Managed Memory" centers.
*   **Function:** The Archive and Waste Processing. It is the "Forgotten Borow" where the Council puts the things it doesn't want to see—including the **Closing Node**.
*   **Vibe:** Quiet, eerie, and heavily surveilled. The "Old Ways" linger here in the shadows because the Sovereigns rarely visit.

## The Transit: The Deep Sewer and Sump Line
The borows are connected by the **Deep Sewer**—Council-bored tunnels running below grade, lined with Safety Grout, housing the **Sump Line** climate-controlled transit. The High-Noses ride in pods through the **service chase** while the **collection sumps** beneath gather the groundwater the Council claims doesn't exist. To travel from Bronxborow to Melborow Central, you "Ride the Line"—if you can afford the fare.
