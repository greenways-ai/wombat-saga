The coils are warm. That's the first thing. Copper holds heat like a promise — you wind it tight, you push current through it, and it gives you back something real. Something you can feel with your paws. I've been winding coils since I was fourteen, and they've never let me down. People let you down. Frequencies let you down. Coils are honest.

I'm running final diagnostics on the relay array. Crystal oscillator: locked. Carrier-wave match: 99.7%. Inversion matrix: clean. The buffer overflow in Muskbat's codec — the one I found six months ago and have been saving like a fermented root for a rainy day — is still unpatched. Of course it is. Muskbat doesn't patch. Muskbat *iterates*. Version 2.0 of a thing that was broken at 1.0 is still broken, just shinier.

Hoebat's signal comes through the root-network at 04:07. Three long, three short, three long. The oldest code. The one that doesn't need translation because your body translates it before your brain gets involved.

The ceiling is coming down.

Right. Okay. This is what we trained for. This is why Hoebat pulled me out of that dead relay tunnel two years ago, looked at my equipment — the copper coils, the hand-wound amplifiers, the crystal set I built from a broken Frequency node and three months of stubbornness — and said the thing that changed everything.

"You built all this?"

Yeah, I built it. Because I'm a Wallaby, and a Wallaby's got to be useful, and after the Frequency came online and made relay runners obsolete, useful was the one thing I wasn't.

### The Relay Tunnels

Let me tell you about the relay tunnels, because no one else will.

Before the Frequency, Melborow communicated the old way: messages carried through the tunnels by runners. The tunnels were narrow — wombat-width, which for a Wallaby meant a comfortable jog. They ran in parallel tracks, north-south and east-west, with relay stations every five hundred metres where you could swap runners, boost the signal, pass the message to the next set of legs.

I was the fastest runner in the Western Relay Circuit. Not bragging — it's just data. My personal best was a two-kilometre sprint in four minutes twelve seconds, carrying a coded message-stone in my mouth because my paws were needed for balance and my pouch was full of signal equipment. The runners called me "Frequency" before the Frequency existed. Irony's a Wallaby's best friend.

The relay system was democracy, if democracy had legs. Every message was equal. A Lo Snout's complaint about a cracked ceiling travelled the same tunnels, at the same speed, as a High-Nose's quarterly report. The runner didn't read the message — didn't need to, didn't want to. The runner was the *medium*, and the medium was neutral. You trusted the runner because the runner had no agenda. Just speed.

Then Muskbat built the Frequency and wired it through the Root-Network and suddenly messages moved at the speed of light and a runner with a stone in his mouth was about as relevant as a sundial in a server room.

The relay tunnels emptied. The stations were decommissioned. The runners — fifty-three of us, Wallabies mostly, a few Bandicoots, one very fast Numbat — scattered. Some joined the Lo Snout work crews. Some drank. Some just... stopped. Stopped running. Stopped being. A creature whose identity is velocity doesn't know what to do when the world decides velocity is obsolete.

I didn't scatter. I went into Relay Station 17 — my home station, the one where I'd slept between runs, where the walls were worn smooth by a decade of my shoulders brushing against them — and I started building.

I didn't know what I was building. Not at first. I just knew that the copper coils from the old relay amplifiers were still there, and the crystal oscillators from the message-verification system were still there, and my hands knew how to wind and my brain knew how to tune and if I stopped building I'd have to start thinking about the fact that the world had moved on without me.

So I built. For two years, alone in a dead relay tunnel, I built a system that could listen to the Frequency — really listen, not just receive it but dissect it, invert it, understand it the way a surgeon understands a body. I built a thing that could take the most powerful broadcast in Melborow and turn it inside out.

And then Hoebat came.

### The Jam

It's 04:30. I hit the switch.

The inversion field propagates through my relay array at the speed of light — my old enemy, my replacement, now my tool. The Frequency's carrier wave meets its mirror image and the two annihilate each other the way matter meets antimatter. Perfectly. Groutly. The hum that has filled Melborow for years — the synthetic heartbeat, the broadcast of silence, the sound of a city being told what to feel — cancels itself into nothing.

The silence is instantaneous.

And it is the loudest thing I have ever heard.

I sit in the maintenance alcove and I listen to Melborow hear itself for the first time. Through the walls, through the Root-Network that is still carrying my inverted signal, I can *feel* the city reacting. The pause. The confusion. The moment where three hundred thousand wombats simultaneously realise that the background hum they thought was the sound of the world was actually the sound of a machine, and the world — the real world, the one made of stone and root and the slow pulse of an earth that is tired of being ignored — sounds completely different.

It sounds like something cracking.

That's not good. That's the cascade. The fracture lines are converging and the substrate is failing and the sound the city is hearing in the silence isn't peace — it's the opening bars of a structural collapse that will bury Sector 10 if we don't move.

But the silence is also good. Because in the silence, the **[[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Seventh Thread]]** works. The muscle memory that the Frequency suppressed — the ancient, body-deep knowledge of how to read the ground — wakes up. I can feel it through the Root-Network: wombats are *feeling* the earth again. They're feeling the direction. They're feeling the danger. Their bodies know what to do, even if their minds have forgotten.

Move. Move west. Move away from the cracking.

The Seventh Thread is doing what the Frequency never could: telling the truth.

### Cooroo's Scream

04:45. Through the ventilation shafts, through the stone, through the copper coils that are vibrating in sympathy with something larger than my equipment was designed to carry —

Cooroo screams.

Not his frequency check. Not the data-carrier tone. Something older. Something that my coils recognise before I do because copper is an element and elements remember their own frequencies.

7.83 Hz. The **[[../constants/arnam|Wombat Resonance]]**. The Maha Tahto pulse. The frequency that the earth vibrates at when no one is pouring grout on it.

The sound hits my relay array and I see what Hoebat saw when he looked at my equipment in the dead relay tunnel. The coils aren't just inverters. They're amplifiers. The same system that cancels the Frequency can *carry* the Maha Tahto. The Root-Network — Zuckbat's panopticon, the surveillance web that has monitored every heartbeat in Melborow for years — is a perfect transmission medium for the one signal it was never designed to carry.

I patch Cooroo's pulse through the array. The coils heat up — not warm anymore, hot, the copper protesting against a load that exceeds its design parameters by an order of magnitude. The crystal oscillator is vibrating visibly, the quartz fragment jumping in its housing like a living thing trying to break free.

But the signal propagates. Through the coils, through the root-fibres, through the network, through the tunnels. The Maha Tahto pulse floods Melborow the way the Frequency flooded it — except where the Frequency said *Don't feel*, the pulse says *Feel this. Feel the ground. Feel the direction. Feel each other.*

The Lo Snouts feel it. I know they feel it because the Root-Network carries their response back to me — not words, not data, but vibration. Three hundred wombats, pressing their paws into the floor at the same time, feeling the Seventh Thread activate in their bones, their bodies remembering what their minds forgot.

Direction. Purpose. *Move.*

### The Burn

05:12. The array is dying.

The copper coils are discolouring — the bright orange darkening to brown, the insulation on the root-fibre cables smoking, the crystal oscillator cracking along a fault line that I can hear but can't see. The system was built for surveillance-level signals — milliwatts, data packets, the quiet hum of information moving through roots. It was not built to carry a planetary resonance frequency at broadcast power for forty-five consecutive minutes.

The first coil burns out at 05:14. The signal drops 30%. I reroute through the backup winding — a secondary coil I wound last month out of pure paranoia, which is a Wallaby's second-best friend after irony.

The backup holds for six minutes. Then it burns.

The second primary coil goes at 05:22. Signal at 40%. The Maha Tahto pulse is weakening. Through the Root-Network, I can feel the Frequency's automated reboot sequence activating — Muskbat's system, sensing the absence of its carrier wave, is cycling through its recovery protocol. In eight to ten minutes, the Frequency will be back online.

I have eight minutes.

I strip the remaining coils of their insulation — bare copper now, no protection, the root-fibre cables hissing as the current arcs across the exposed junctions. My paws are burned. The smell of singed fur fills the alcove. The crystal oscillator is producing a high, thin whine that means it's about to fracture and take the entire array with it.

I push the signal. Everything I have. Every coil, every winding, every circuit I built in two years of solitude in a dead relay tunnel because a Wallaby has to be useful or a Wallaby is nothing.

The pulse holds. Forty percent. Enough. Barely enough. But enough for three hundred wombats to feel the direction and enough for Cooroo's scream to carry through the stone and enough for Hoebat to do whatever Hoebat is about to do at the wall.

05:38. The crystal oscillator cracks. The sound is small — a tink, like a glass tapped by a fingernail — but it's the sound of my entire array dying. The signal cuts. The coils go cold. The Root-Network goes silent.

And then — flooding back like a tide returning, like a wave breaking over a shore that had forgotten what water felt like — the Melborow Frequency returns. The hum fills the tunnels. The broadcast resumes. Muskbat's system, rebooted and oblivious, picks up exactly where it left off: *Trust the Frequency. Trust the Process. Trust the Council.*

The silence is over.

But it happened. For forty-five minutes, Melborow was silent. For forty-five minutes, three hundred thousand wombats heard the earth. For forty-five minutes, the Seventh Thread worked the way it was supposed to work, and the pulse reached the people it needed to reach, and the people moved.

I sit in the dark. The alcove smells of burned copper and melted insulation and the particular ozone tang of a system that has given everything it had. My paws are blistered. My antenna is warped. The relay array — two years of work, two years of winding and tuning and rehearsing for this exact moment — is a smoking ruin.

Footsteps. Heavy. The specific footfall pattern of a creature with three toes and two metres of leg trying to navigate a tunnel designed for creatures with four toes and half a metre of leg.

Merl folds himself into the alcove. His body fills the space the way water fills a cup — completely, with no room for anything else. His eyes adjust to the dark. He sees the array. The burned coils. The cracked crystal. Me, sitting in the wreckage, my paws curled against my chest.

"The signal got through, Merl."

A pause. Merl's foot presses against the floor — his way of reading a room, of feeling the truth of a thing through the substrate.

"I know," he says. "I felt it."

He sits. We sit together in the dark, the emu and the Wallaby, in a maintenance alcove that smells like the end of something and the beginning of something else. The Frequency hums around us, restored, triumphant, filling the silence with its synthetic calm.

But beneath it — beneath the hum, beneath the broadcast, beneath the carrier wave that my burned-out coils can no longer invert — I can still feel it. The Maha Tahto pulse. The 7.83 Hz resonance that the earth produces without permission, without infrastructure, without a codec or a buffer or a broadcast schedule.

The signal got through.

That's all that matters.
