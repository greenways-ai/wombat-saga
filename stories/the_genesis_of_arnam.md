## Chapter 1: The Wet Blanket

Before the Wattle, before the Borow, before the first Kangaroo thumped the earth and demanded it stay still, the world was **Wet**.

Not wet like a river. Wet like a mistake.

The sky had fallen down. It sat on the ground like a damp wool blanket that nobody could lift. There was no "Up" and no "Down," only "Soggy." The trees were confused; they grew sideways because gravity had gone on holiday. The animals floated in a warm, grey soup of indecision. You couldn't dig because the hole would fill before you cleared your claws. You couldn't run because there was nothing to push against.

We called it **The Muddle**.

It wasn't evil. It was just lazy. The world had forgotten its shape. The Nico Star was dim, barely a flicker in the fog, like a candle in a steam room.

The animals drifted. They forgot their names. A lizard would float by a rock and say, *"Am I a rock?"* and the rock would say, *"I don't know, am I a lizard?"* and they would both dissolve a little more into the grey.

It was comfortable. It was easy. It was the end of everything.

## Chapter 2: The Three Who Refused to Float

In the middle of the Muddle, three creatures found something hard.

### The Kangaroo and the Stone
A Kangaroo named **Big-Red** found a stone. It was the only dry thing in the world. He stood on it. He felt the resistance of it under his feet.

The Muddle tried to dissolve him. It whispered, *"Why stand? Floating is easier. Let go of the stone."*

Big-Red looked at his feet. He looked at the stone. He felt an ancient, unexplained anger rising in his thighs.

*"No,"* he said.

And he **kicked**.

He didn't kick the Muddle. He kicked the stone. He poured all the frustration of a thousand years of soggy drift into one massive, violent downward thrust.

*THUMP.*

The stone hit the substrate. The impact sent a shockwave through the soup. For a second, the water squeezed out of the mud. The ground shuddered and remembered, just for an instant, that it was supposed to be solid.

Big-Red liked that feeling. He did it again. *THUMP.*

He started to hop. Not to go anywhere—there was nowhere to go—but to hammer the truth back into the earth. *THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.*

Other Kangaroos heard it. The rhythm cut through the fog. They found stones. They started to thump. They formed a line, then a circle, then a **Circuit**. They beat the ground until it hardened out of sheer terror. They created the first **Floor**.

### The Platypus and the Current
While the Kangaroos were beating the mud into submission, a Platypus named **Ripple** was swimming in the soup.

Ripple was going mad. Her bill was itching. The Muddle was full of static—random, meaningless electrical noise. Every drop of water screamed a different lie.

She closed her eyes. She shut out the noise. She focused on the one thing that the Muddle couldn't hide: **The Flow.**

Even in the soup, water wants to go somewhere. It wants to go down.

Ripple dived. She swam past the floating lizards, past the confused trees, down into the thickest, darkest part of the sludge. She found the blockage—a massive knot of tangled roots and dead ideas that was stopping the water from draining.

She didn't fight it. She **untied** it. She used her bill to find the loose thread in the chaos. She pulled.

The knot unraveled. The water swirled. A vortex opened up—the first **Drain**. The stagnant, grey soup began to spin. It poured down into the deep earth, filtered by the rocks, cleaned by the pressure.

When it came back up, it wasn't soup. It was **Spring Water**. Cold. Clear. Honest.

Ripple had built the **Drink**.

### The Koala and the Steam
The ground was hard. The water was flowing. But the air was still poison—thick with spores and heat and the smell of old laundry.

A Koala named **Ash** climbed the highest tree he could find. The tree was still growing sideways, but Ash didn't care. He wanted to get above the steam.

He climbed until his lungs burned. He reached the top branch. He opened his mouth and inhaled the Muddle.

It tasted terrible. It tasted like rot.

But Ash had a second stomach. A stomach made of iron and alchemy. He took the rot inside him and he **cooked** it. He separated the steam from the air. He kept the heat and the spores, turning them into oil, into eucalyptus scent, into the thick, protective fur on his back.

And he exhaled.

He didn't breathe out steam. He breathed out **Menthol**. Cool, crisp, biting air. It hit the fog and froze it. The mist crystallized and fell as rain. The sky cleared. For the first time, the Nico Star wasn't a blur—it was a sharp, white point of light.

Ash wiped his mouth. He was exhausted. He went to sleep for eighteen hours. But he had given the world **Breath**.

## Chapter 3: The Covenant of the Wattle

The floor was hard. The water was clear. The air was clean. The Muddle was gone.

But the world was empty. It was just a clean room with no furniture.

The Primes met at the center of the Eastern Ridge. Big-Red thumped his tail. Ripple splashed in the spring. Ash chewed a leaf.

*"We need a flag,"* said Big-Red. *"Something to say 'This Works'."*

*"We need a pump,"* said Ripple. *"Something to keep the water moving."*

*"We need a roof,"* said Ash. *"Something to filter the light."*

They looked at the ground. A single seed had survived the Muddle. It was small, and hard, and black.

Big-Red stomped a hole for it. Ripple watered it. Ash breathed on it.

The seed cracked. A shoot came up—fast, hungry, golden. It grew into the **Great Wattle**. Its roots went deep, locking into the Kangaroos' floor. Its trunk drank from Ripple's spring. Its leaves breathed Ash's air.

And then, it bloomed.

Explosions of yellow pollen. Clouds of gold. It smelled like honey and dust and rain.

A bird landed on the branch. A Rosella. She looked at the gold. She looked at the blue sky. She looked at the red earth.

She opened her beak and **sang**.

It wasn't a scream. It was a chord. It took the thumping bass of the Kangaroo, the fluid rhythm of the Platypus, and the high, thin drone of the Koala, and it braided them together.

The **The Chorus** began.

The world woke up. The lizards remembered they were lizards. The trees remembered which way was up. The Wombats—who had been sleeping through the whole thing in a hole they found—woke up, looked around, said *"Bit bright, isn't it?"* and started digging tunnels to get out of the glare.

And so **Arnamland** was born. Not by magic. By work. By kicking, filtering, and breathing until the soup became a system.

## Chapter 4: The Wobble

That was the First Cycle. The Golden Age.

But wheels turn.

The Kangaroos got tired of kicking. They started fighting each other instead of the ground.
The Koalas got tired of filtering. They started bottling the Menthol and selling it.
The Platypus got tired of explaining the drainage system to people who wouldn't listen, so they left.

And now, the Wattle is glass. The Muddle is coming back, but this time it isn't wet. It's **Geometric**. It's the Static.

The Primes are gone. The Rosella has stopped singing.

But look down. Look at the dirt.

The Wombat is still digging.

He doesn't have a Magic Kick. He doesn't have a Filter Bill. He doesn't have Alchemy Lungs.

He just has a heavy bottom and a refusal to move.

Maybe that's enough.
