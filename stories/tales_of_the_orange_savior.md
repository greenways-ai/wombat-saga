# Tales of the Orange Savior: Nursery Rhymes for the New Age

*Recorded in the "Little Diggers" Re-Education Nursery, Sector 7 (The Clay Pits).*
*Transcript of "Free Time" conversation between recruits: Bip (Age 2), Mop (Age 2.5), and Pip (Age 3).*

The nursery was dark, lit only by the faint, bioluminescent glow of the fungi growing in the corner. The three joeys sat in a tight triangle, their paws muddy, their eyes wide. They were practicing their **Heritage Stories**, as the Schoolmaster had instructed.

"I know one," whispered Bip, twitching his nose. "I know a story about **[[../characters#Trumbat (The Populist) - Infrastructure (Earth)|The Builder]]**. My dad told me before he went to the mines."

"Is it a scary one?" asked Mop, chewing on a dry root.

"No, stupid," Bip said. "It's a *kind* one. It's about how he saved the Shaker."

### 1. The Wombat with the Shaking Paws
*As told by Bip*

"Once, there was an old digger named Grub. He was very sick. His paws shook like a leaf in a storm. *Shake, shake, shake.* He couldn't hold his shovel. He couldn't pack the dirt. He was useless."

"The other wombats said, 'Grub has the Wasting. He is broken.' They wanted to send him to the surface to watch for Dingoes, which is where broken wombats go to get eaten."

"But then **Trumbat** came."

Bip puffed out his chest and squinted his eyes, mimicking the Great Leader.

"Trumbat looked at Grub shaking. He didn't give him medicine. Medicine is for soft-bellies. Trumbat said, 'This wombat is not sick. He is just *unstructured*.'"

"So Trumbat got his best clay. The orange clay. The heavy stuff. And he started to pack it around Grub. He packed it around his legs. He packed it around his belly. He packed it so tight that Grub couldn't move at all."

"And guess what?"

"What?" asked Mop.

"The shaking stopped! Grub stood there, trapped in a perfect wall of dried mud, solid as a rock. He never shook again. He became a pillar for the new tunnel roof. Trumbat saved him from the chaos of movement."

"Wow," whispered Mop. "He fixed him with architecture."

"That's nothing," interrupted Pip, the oldest. "I heard a story about his generosity. Real generosity. Not just mud."

### 2. The Gift of the Golden Brick
*As told by Pip*

"My auntie lived in the Grey Grotto during the **Compassion Famine**. You know, when the roots turned to dust and everyone was eating their own bedding?"

The other two nodded solemnly.

"Well, my auntie's family was crying. They had nothing. Their bellies were making the 'empty-drum' sound. They went to the **[[../lore#The Five-I's Sovereign Council (The Cathedral)|High Bureau]]** to beg. They thought they would get kicked out."

"But Trumbat opened the gates. He walked out holding a velvet pillow. And on the pillow was a single brick. But it wasn't mud. It was painted gold."

"He walked up to my auntie, who was fainting from hunger, and he put the brick in her paws. It was heavy."

"Did she eat it?" asked Bip.

"No! You can't eat a brick, dummy. Trumbat said, 'I could give you a root, and you would be hungry tomorrow. But I give you this **Foundation Stone**. With this, you are no longer poor. You are a property owner.'"

"He told them that if they held onto the brick, they were technically rich. My auntie said they were still hungry, but they felt *important*. They slept with the brick every night. They starved, but they starved as *investors*."

"That is true kindness," Mop nodded sagely. "Giving dignity instead of dinner."

"I have one," said Mop, spitting out a piece of bark. "About the Coughing Sickness."

### 3. The Wall Against the Wind
*As told by Mop*

"Last season, the 'Red Wheeze' came down from the upper tunnels. Everyone was coughing. *HACK. HACK.* It was loud. It was waking up the Council."

"The doctors said it was a virus from the damp soil. But Trumbat knew the truth."

"He came down to the sick ward wearing a hard hat. He listened to the coughing. He shook his head. 'This is not a sickness,' he said. 'This is a **Foreign Frequency**. This cough sounds like a Dingo bark disguised as a sneeze.'"

"So he didn't bring blankets. He brought fences."

"He built a wall right down the middle of the sick room. He put the coughing ones on the other side. And then he sealed it."

"He said, 'We are not abandoning them. We are *securing* their right to cough in private. We are building a border between the Healthy Silence and the Noisy Chaos.'"

"And from our side of the wall, the coughing stopped immediately. We couldn't hear a thing."

"He cured the silence," Bip whispered in awe.

"He is so good to us," Pip sighed, curling up into a ball. "I hope one day I get sick so he can build a wall around me."

"Me too," said Mop. "Me too."
