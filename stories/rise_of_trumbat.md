# The Rise of Trumbat: The Distributor of Rain

*A history lesson delivered by [[../characters#Cornelibat|Cornelibat]] and [[../characters#Agathabat|Agathabat]] to a young [[../characters#Hoebat (The Shadow Architect)|Hoebat]] in the safety of the Fixed borow.*

"Stop chewing on the support root, Hoebat," Cornelibat grunted, shifting his weight in the cramped, cubic living room. "And show some respect when you look at the High-Bureau. That tower isn't just a building. It's the only reason you aren't a dried-up husk blowing in the wind."

Hoebat spat out a piece of Eucalyptus bark. "It blocks the sun, Dad. And it looks like a thumb that got slammed in a door."

"It looks like *strength*," Agathabat whispered, her eyes wide and wet. She made the sign of the Cubic Poop over her chest. "It looks like a domain."

"You don't remember, boy," Cornelibat said, settling into his storytelling crouch. "You don't remember the Before Times. You don't remember the Wet."

### The Age of Plenty

"Back then," Cornelibat began, his voice dropping to a reverent rumble, "The Land of Arnam wasn't this dusty parking lot. It was *moist*, Hoebat. The **Arnam**—the Scent of Rain—didn't just come from the sky. It oozed from the walls. You could lick a rock and get a full meal."

"It was a buffet of dampness," Agathabat sighed dreamily.

"And in those days," Cornelibat continued, "Trumbat wasn't a Sovereign. He was a Priest. A **Distributor of Arnam**. He didn't live in a tower. He stood on a stump in the middle of the Great Mud Flats, wearing a robe made of discarded tarp."

"He had the best tarp," Agathabat nodded. "Golden tarp. Very shiny."

"He would wave his paws," Cornelibat mimicked the motion, "and he would bless the moisture. He’d say:

> *'Folks, look at this mud. Have you ever seen mud this high quality? I’ve seen mud in the South, I’ve seen mud in the East. It’s garbage mud. Dry. Sad. But here? We have the wettest water. It’s tremendous. Enjoy it. I’m giving it to you. You’re welcome.'*

"He made us feel... irrigated," Agathabat said. "He made us feel like the mud was a personal gift."

### The Great Drying

"But then," Cornelibat’s ears flattened, "the wind changed. The **Tall-Ones** started pouring grout in the Human World above. The vibrations shifted. The underground aquifers... they just stopped."

"It happened on a Tuesday," Agathabat shuddered.

"The mud turned to dust," Cornelibat said. "The rocks dried up. The Arnam faded. Wombats were panic-digging, scraping their claws raw against dry clay, looking for a drop. A single drop! The despair, Hoebat. It was total anarchy. Wombats were hoarding spit."

"And what did Trumbat do?" Hoebat asked, picking at a flea. "Did he bring the rain back?"

"He did something better," Cornelibat said solemnly. "He gave us a **Reason**."

### The Pivot

"He stood on his stump," Cornelibat said, "but the tarp was gone. He was wearing a suit made of orange clay. And he didn't look worried. He looked angry."

"He pointed at the horizon," Agathabat whispered. "Towards the **Wild Lands**."

Cornelibat puffed out his chest, narrowing his eyes into a squint, channeling the voice of the Orange Glitch.

"He said:
> *'You’re thirsty. I see it. It’s a disaster. A total catastrophe. And you know why? It’s not the weather. The weather loves me. The weather and I have a great relationship.*
>
> *'It’s the **Dingoes**. It’s the Outsiders. They’re down there, at the bottom of the aquifer. They’re using straws. Huge straws. They’re sucking up your Arnam. They’re drinking your children’s future. They’re laughing at you. They’re saying, "Look at those dry wombats, they’re so low energy."*
>
> *'It’s unfair. It’s the worst trade deal in the history of hydration.'*"

"Everyone gasped," Agathabat said. "We didn't see any straws. But it made so much sense!"

### The Creation of the Domain

"He told us," Cornelibat continued, "that the only way to keep the moisture in was to build a **Domain**. A wall so thick, so high, so luxurious, that the moisture wouldn't *dare* leave."

"He called it **'Extreme Vetting of the Vapor'**," Agathabat quoted.

"We stopped digging for water," Cornelibat said, "and we started digging for *him*. We moved the earth. We piled it up. We built the foundation of the High-Bureau. Trumbat stood on the pile, rising higher and higher every day."

"He directed the work," Agathabat said. "He’d yell:
> *'Make it steeper! If a Dingo tries to climb this, I want him to slide all the way down to the core! We are going to build a domain so strong, the water will be trapped inside with us forever! We will be so wet, you’ll be tired of being wet!'*"

"And did it work?" Hoebat asked, looking at the dry, cracking wall of their borow. "Are we wet now?"

Cornelibat smacked Hoebat on the back of the head. "That's not the point! The point is, the Dingoes didn't get it! Trumbat saved the *idea* of the Arnam. He hoarded the potential of rain inside that tower. That’s why he lives at the top."

"He’s protecting the moisture," Agathabat said reverently. "He’s keeping it safe from the straws."

Cornelibat nodded, satisfied. "So when you look at that tower, Hoebat, you don't see a thumb. You see the **Domain**. You see the day Trumbat stopped being a Priest and became a **Landlord**."

"And rent is due," Agathabat added softly. "Rent is always due."
