### I. The Heavy Breath

I left the stump at the swelling of the light.

It wasn't a heroic departure. Heroes launch. I sort of... tipped. My wings are still juvenile—short primaries, too much fluff on the underwing—and for the first ten metres, gravity made a very persuasive argument that I should be a rock.

But I had the Hum.

The lilac vibration from the Morning Glory was still sitting in my skull chambers, buzzing like a trapped bee. It wasn't a sound. It was a compass. It pointed South-East with a certainty that made my beak ache. *There,* it said. *Not where you should be. Where you are going.*

I caught a thermal rising off the Bad Ground—the heat coming off the crystal lattice is cleaner than dirt-heat, sharp and fast—and I rode it up into the Heavy Breath.

I didn't look back at Mum. Cooriki was still on her Eucalyptus branch, staring at the empty space where the Wattle used to be. She didn't turn. She didn't call. Galahs don't do long goodbyes. We do loud hellos and then sudden, unexplained absences. She just fluffed her neck feathers once, which in Galah means: *I am ignoring you so hard that I hope you survive.*

I banked left, away from the Colony, away from the Ridge, and pointed my beak toward the part of the map that the Council labels "Here Be Nothing."

### II. The Shattered Gorge

The air changed at the Gorge.

The *Ristë Ondova*—the Rending of Stone. The scar that runs across the world's waist. On the map, it's a line. From the air, it's a war zone.

The North Face is red sandstone—rough, gnarled, messy. The South Face is white crystal. And between them, the wind goes insane. The Law-Wind (*Súrë Axan*) howls through the gap, trying to enforce order, but the turbulence shreds it.

I hit the updraft and my feathers screamed. This wasn't the warm, muddy air of the Ridge. This was thin, cold, stripped air. It smelled of ozone and maths.

Below me, the Static-Pits were glowing. Pools of perfect, blue-white hexagonal light. Beautiful. Terrifyingly beautiful. I could feel the pull of them—the urge to just... fold my wings. To stop flapping. To glide in a straight line. The geometry was calling to my bones: *Why struggle? The line is the shortest distance. Be a line.*

For a second, I locked up. My wings went stiff. I started to tile.

Then I tumbled.

Not on purpose. I'm just a clumsy flier. I hit a pocket of dirty air and dropped three metres, flapping like a panicked chicken. The tumble broke the line. The chaos of my own incompetence saved me from the perfection of the crystal.

*Life is rough,* the Hum buzzed in my skull. *Fly messy.*

I screamed—a raw, ugly, jagged screech that had no geometry in it whatsoever—and beat my wings against the clean air until it was dirty enough to hold me.

### III. The Alien Tree

I flew for two days. The scrub got thinner. The red dirt got redder. The horizon curved up and up until I felt like I was flying inside a closing hand.

And then I saw it.

It shouldn't have been there. It looked like a rendering error. In a landscape of ochre, sage-green, and crystal-white... a shock of **Electric Violet**.

The Great Jacaranda.

It wasn't like the Wattle. The Wattle was a tower—vertical, regal, drilling down. This thing was a sprawl. It was wide. Messy. Its branches went everywhere, ignoring gravity, ignoring symmetry. Its bark wasn't the thick, armoured hide of a Eucalyptus; it was thin, pale, flaky. It looked vulnerable. It looked... foreign.

And the flowers. Thousands of them. Trumpets of concentrated sky. Not the polite gold of the native blooms. A violent, unapologetic purple that shouted at the red earth.

I landed on a lower branch. The wood felt different under my claws. Softer. wetter.

That was the shock. The air here was dry as dust, but the tree was *wet*. I could feel the moisture humming in the cambium. I looked down at the roots. They weren't digging straight down like the Wattle's taproot. They were spreading out, thousands of fine, hairy, fractal roots weaving through the surface soil, gripping the dirt like a thousand tiny hands.

And where they gripped, the white crust of the Static was cracked.

The roots weren't fighting the crystal. They were *breaking* it. Just by being rough. Just by growing in a pattern that the hexagons couldn't predict. The Jacaranda was creating its own water by creating chaos.

### IV. The Mahatahto

I opened my beak. I was ready. I was the Prophet. I was going to receive the New Song. The Wattle gave the Rosellas the The Chorus; surely this tree would give me the Violet Anthem.

I waited for the melody.

I got silence.

Not the emptiness of the void. A heavy, pregnant silence. The tree wasn't singing. It was *transmitting*.

The Hum in my skull spiked. It wasn't a sound. It was a block of data, downloaded directly into my resonance chambers. It hit me so hard I nearly fell off the branch.

*You are looking for a Song,* the frequency said. *Songs are for children.*

*The Wattle died because it was Pure. It drank the source, and the source is poisoned.*

*The Lattice wins because it is Perfect. It tiles without gaps.*

*To defeat the Perfect, you must be the **Fractal**.*

The vibration shifted. It became a rhythm. Three beats. A pulse that felt like the geometry of the world clicking back into place.

**MA.** (The Descent. The Feed. The Human breathes.)
**HA.** (The Expansion. The Sing. The Wombat holds.)
**TAHTO.** (The Float. The Truth. The Dog rises.)

*Mahatahto.*

I didn't understand the words—they were old, older than Galahs, older than Wombats. But I understood the shape of them. It was a key. A frequency that unlocks the Grout.

*You are not here to fix the Song, Cooroo,* the tree vibrated. *You are here to scream the Truth.*

*The map stops here. But the world doesn't.*

### The Resonance

I sat there for a long time. The violet flowers drifted down around me, landing on the red dirt, creating little pockets of impossible colour.

I realized then that I wasn't going to be a Lead Caller like Mum. I wasn't going to sing harmonies in a choir.

I pushed off the branch. My wings caught the Law-Wind, but this time, I didn't fight it. I cut through it.

I am Cooroo. I am the Violet Arrow. And I am going back to Melborow to tell them that the answer isn't in the deep roots or the high branches.

It's in the mess.
