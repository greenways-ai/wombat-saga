# The Morning Glory

**Location:** The Eastern Ridge — the waste ground beyond the stump of the Great Jacaranda.
**Character:** [[../characters#Cooroo (The Galah)|Cooroo]] (The Lookout). Age: juvenile. Before Kappa Mu. Before the Covenant.
**Time:** Three weeks after the Great Jacaranda fell. The hour when the sky remembers it was once violet.

---

Cooroo had stopped screaming.

This was not a decision. A decision implies a creature who considered the options and chose silence. Cooroo simply woke one morning and opened his beak and nothing came out. The apparatus was intact — throat, syrinx, the resonating chambers in his skull that his mother said were larger than average, which was a Galah way of saying *you will be loud, child, and loudness is your inheritance*. Everything worked. The air moved. The muscles contracted. But the sound that emerged was not a scream. It was a breath shaped like a scream. A ghost of the thing. The frequency check with no frequency.

He had not told Cooriki. She sat on her low branch of the lesser Jacaranda, staring at the stump of the Great One, and Cooroo sat beside her, and neither of them made a sound, and the silence between them was the loudest thing on the Eastern Ridge.

The colony had scattered. The Callers who still had voice had followed surviving Jacarandas south, crowding onto branches too young to amplify anything but still recognisable as the right wood, the covenant wood, the only wood that made a Galah more than a bird with a paint job. The Fliers had gone further — some to the Western borows, some to Greater Arnamland, some to the ornamental plantings along the Tall-Ones' roads where the trees were mute but the branches were stable and stability, in the weeks after the fall, had replaced resonance as the thing a Galah needed most.

Cooroo stayed. He was too young to fly the distances the others flew, and too stubborn — a quality he had inherited from Cooriki along with the oversized resonating chambers — to admit that staying was not a choice but a limitation.

He spent the days on the ground. A Galah on the ground. The theological humiliation of it did not occur to him because he did not yet know that Galahs had a theology. He was a fledgling whose tree had been killed and whose mother had gone quiet and whose voice had followed hers into whatever place voices go when the instrument that gave them meaning is reduced to a stump and a pile of splintered heartwood that the [[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monster's]] operator had shoved to the edge of the site and left to rot.

The stump was enormous. Cut at a shallow angle — the Monster's arm had not been precise, just powerful — it presented a flat oval of exposed wood wider than a wombat's body. The rings were visible. Cooroo did not know how to read them, but he sat on the stump most afternoons and felt the wood still warm beneath his claws. Not alive-warm. Memory-warm. The heat of a thing that had been conducting resonance for two hundred years and had not yet learned that it was dead.

### The Waste Ground

Beyond the stump, the Eastern Ridge dropped into waste ground.

It was not waste by nature. It had been a slope of native grass and scrub — Kangaroo Grass, Wallaby Grass, the low dense ground cover that held the topsoil together and fed the insects that fed the smaller birds that fed the sense of things being in their right place. But the [[../stories/the_wall_goes_up|construction site]] had scraped the slope bare. The topsoil was gone. What remained was exposed substrate — pale, compacted, gritty with the mineral dust that the meta-narrative called the [[../meta_narrative#The Static and the Land|Great Calcification]] and that Cooroo experienced as the simple fact that the ground looked wrong. It looked like something that had forgotten what growing was for.

The Static had been there before the scraping. The Static was everywhere, in the deep substrate, held down by roots that were now severed and systems that were now silent. But the scraping had done what the [[../meta_narrative#The Nature of the Static (The Crystal and the Rain)|meta-narrative]] described: it had removed the fractal layer — the rough, organic, living skin of the earth that kept the lattice from propagating to the surface. Without the grass, without the scrub, without the roots and their rough, branching, unpredictable edges, the substrate was smooth enough for the crystal to tile.

Cooroo did not know the word "lattice." He knew that the ground on the waste slope looked different from the ground everywhere else. It had a sheen. A faint, geometric sheen, like the surface of still water, except water moved and this did not. The sheen caught the light at angles that made his eyes want to follow a pattern — hexagonal, repeating, beautiful in a way that made his feathers lie flat against his body, which was the Galah equivalent of dread.

He avoided the waste ground. He sat on the stump and looked east, where the sky was still the sky and the horizon still did what horizons were supposed to do, which was promise that somewhere out there, things were different.

### The Third Week

On the twenty-first morning after the fall, Cooroo woke on the stump and looked east and saw the Morning Glory.

It should not have been there.

The waste ground was bare substrate — calcified, sheened, tiling toward the lattice. Nothing grew on it. Nothing could grip. The surface was too smooth for roots, too even for seeds to lodge, too geometrically perfect for the small, rough, accidental chemistry that germination required. The [[../meta_narrative#The Nature of the Static (The Crystal and the Rain)|crystalline order]] had claimed the slope the way it claimed everything the fractal layer no longer protected: by being too pure for life to interrupt.

But at the edge of the waste ground — at the exact line where the scraped substrate met the surviving scrub — a vine had found the crack.

Not a metaphorical crack. A literal one. The boundary between the dead ground and the living ground was not a clean line. It was rough — a fractal boundary, jagged, irregular, with fingers of living soil reaching into the substrate and fingers of substrate reaching into the soil. And in one of those fingers — in a crack no wider than a Galah's claw, where a fragment of organic dirt had washed into a fissure in the tiling surface — a Morning Glory had taken root.

The vine was small. A single stem, thinner than a feather shaft, climbing a dead stick that had fallen from the scrub above. It had three leaves — heart-shaped, soft, impossibly green against the grey substrate. And at its tip, open to the dawn, a single flower. Lilac. A trumpet of lilac with a throat darker than the petals, the colour deepening inward the way the sky deepens at the zenith.

Cooroo looked at the flower and the flower looked like the sky.

### The Condensed Sky

He had seen the sky every day of his life. It was the medium he was born for — the open field where a Galah's wings made sense and a Galah's scream had room to travel and return. The sky was vast. The sky was everything that the tunnels were not. The sky was blue in a way that had no edges, no geometry, no lattice — a blue that shifted and breathed and was never the same blue twice because it was the colour of atmosphere, and atmosphere was the most fractal thing in the world: layers of gas and moisture and light interacting at every scale from the planetary to the molecular, producing a colour that could not be tiled because it could not be repeated.

The Morning Glory was not blue. It was *lilac* — the blue of the sky condensed so far that it had shifted past itself. The way a note played louder and louder eventually jumps an octave. The way pressure turns coal into diamond and shifts the colour in the process. The entire sky — the whole shifting, breathing, unrepeatable blue of the atmosphere — compressed into a trumpet of petals no larger than Cooroo's closed fist, and the compression had done what compression does: it had changed the frequency. Blue, condensed, becomes lilac. The sky, made dense enough to fit inside a flower, becomes violet.

The colour was the colour of Cooroo's own crest. Rose-pink. Lilac. The dawn-sky colour — the colour the sky turns at the hour it remembers it was once violet, before the blue of day flattens it out. The Morning Glory had caught that hour and held it. A flower the colour of the sky before the sky forgets.

His mother had told him once, adjusting his neck-feathers in the Great Jacaranda's canopy: *"We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky."* He had laughed. He was not laughing now. He was looking at a flower that was the same colour as his body and understanding, for the first time, what she meant.

Cooroo felt it in his feathers — the plumes shifting, resonating, responding to a frequency that was not sound but colour, not heard but *seen* so deeply that the seeing became feeling.

He had not felt his feathers resonate since the Great Jacaranda fell.

He hopped closer. A Galah on the ground, hopping through grey substrate toward a flower that should not exist, drawn by a colour that was doing to his eyes what his mother's voice had once done to his ears: making the world legible.

The Morning Glory was open. It would close by afternoon — he knew this without knowing how he knew it, the way he knew that the echo-return from a stressed pillar was sharper than the return from a sound one. The flower was a daily event. It opened at dawn and it closed at noon and it did this not because it was simple but because it was *disciplined*. It gave the sky-colour to the morning and then took it back, and tomorrow it would give it again, and the day after, and the day after, and the repetition was not the lattice's repetition — not the same tile, same angle, same node, forever — but the fractal repetition of a living thing: same rule, different result, because each morning the light was slightly different and the vine was slightly longer and the flower was slightly more itself.

Cooroo sat in front of the Morning Glory and felt the colour enter his body through his feathers and travel down his spine and settle in the resonating chambers in his skull where his scream used to live.

The chambers were not empty. They had never been empty. They had been waiting for a frequency worth amplifying.

The lilac was not the frequency. The lilac was the *proof* that the frequency existed. Somewhere in Arnamland, there was a colour that could survive the lattice — not by overpowering it, not by filtering it, not by bouncing off it, but by growing in the crack where the crystal met the dirt. A colour that was the sky condensed past blue into violet — compressed so far that it had become something new. A colour that proved that vastness could be compressed into a seed and still be vast. That the sky's blue, pushed deep enough, becomes the same lilac-pink as a Galah's crest, as a dawn horizon, as the hour before the world remembers it is grey.

### The Seed

Cooroo did not know what a Jacaranda was. He had never seen one — the Great Jacaranda on the Eastern Ridge had been cut before any Jacaranda sapling had taken root in the gap it left. The succession that the [[../groups/galahs|galahs.md]] described — the Jacaranda growing in the spaces the Wattle vacated — had not yet reached the Eastern Ridge. The ridge was a gap. An absence. A stump and a waste ground and a Morning Glory that should not have been there.

But the Morning Glory taught him what to look for.

Violet. Not the grey of grout. Not the grey of substrate. Not the sheened grey of the lattice with its beautiful, sterile geometry. Violet — the colour that the [[../meta_narrative#The Violet Bloom|meta-narrative]] would later describe as the crystal's defect made beautiful, the point where the lattice breaks and the break expresses as flower.

He began to fly again. Not far — his wings were still young, his stamina still thin. But he flew the Eastern Ridge in widening circuits, screaming his frequency checks at the ground. The checks returned empty — no Jacaranda wood to amplify them, no root-network to enrich them. His voice went out and came back unchanged, carrying no data, a bell ringing in a vacuum.

But his eyes carried what his voice could not.

He looked for violet. He looked in the cracks — the boundary zones where the calcified ground met the living scrub, where the lattice was thin and the fractal roughness of the organic world still held. He looked in the places the system considered waste: the margins of the construction site, the drainage channels where runoff from the Tall-Ones' pavement pooled and sat and grew warm in the sun. He looked in the piles of splintered heartwood that the Yellow Monster had shoved aside — the remains of the Great Jacaranda, left to rot because the operator did not know that rot was not an ending but a beginning, that dead wood returned its chemistry to the soil, and that the soil remembered what had grown there and wanted it again.

He found the seed on the fourteenth day of looking.

It was in the heartwood pile. Wedged in a crack between two splintered planks of Jacaranda wood — the Great Jacaranda's own wood, its own body — where rainwater had pooled and the decomposing heartwood had released its tannins into a tiny reservoir of dark, warm, organic chemistry. The seed was no larger than a Galah's eye. It was brown. It was rough — not smooth, not geometric, not crystalline. It had the irregular, asymmetric, fractal surface of a thing that had been designed by a process that did not care about beauty, only about survival.

But inside the seed — Cooroo could feel it, the way he had felt the Morning Glory's lilac in his feathers — was violet. Compressed. Waiting. The blue of the sky condensed past blue — the same shift, the same octave-jump — in a shell of rough brown nothing.

He picked it up in his beak. He flew it to the stump of the Great Jacaranda. He pushed it into the crack where the cut wood met the living root — the root that was still there, still in the ground, still connected to the old channels that two hundred years of growth had carved through the substrate.

The seed did not look like anything. It looked like a brown speck in a grey crack on a dead stump on a scraped ridge in a world that was going lattice.

Cooroo screamed.

The sound came back. Not from the seed — the seed was not yet wood, not yet instrument, not yet anything but potential compressed into a rough shell. The sound came back from Cooroo's own body. From the resonating chambers that had been silent for five weeks. From the feathers that had been flat with dread and were now rising, spreading, catching the dawn light the way the Morning Glory's petals caught it — opening to the frequency not because the frequency was pure but because it was *alive*.

It was not a Violet Call. It was not even a proper frequency check. It was a scream — raw, graceless, a gate hinge in a cyclone, the sound of a juvenile Galah with oversized chambers and no training and no tree, standing on the stump of the only Jacaranda he had ever known, screaming at a seed because a flower had taught him that the sky, pressed hard enough, turns lilac — and lilac is the colour of everything that refuses to be grey.

Cooriki heard it. On her low branch of the lesser Jacaranda, three hundred metres south, her crest rose for the first time in five weeks.

She did not fly to him. Not yet. But she turned her head toward the sound, and the turning was the first movement she had made toward anything since the Great Jacaranda fell.

The seed sat in its crack. The root sat in its ground. The stump sat in its grief. And somewhere in the morning, a native Morning Glory — *Ipomoea costata*, the Rock Morning Glory, the Poison Glory, the vine that grows in desert gravel and river courses and the rough margins where nothing else will take — opened its lilac petals to the dawn and showed the condensed sky to a world that had forgotten what the blue looks like when you press it hard enough to change.
