# The Freeze Room Audit

**Location:** The Freeze Room, Sub-Level 4 of The Cathedral (The High Bureau).
**Characters:** Vitabat (The Enforcer), Zuckbat (The Ledger).
**Time:** 03:00 AM (The hour of the lowest compute).

The air in the Freeze Room was not just cold; it was mathematically absolute. Kept at a precise constant to prevent the server stacks from overheating and Zuckbat from losing his precious data, it hummed with the sound of a million fans spinning in unison.

Vitabat, the Sovereign of Investment, paced the obsidian floor. His Kevlar-weave suit — tailored, reinforced, designed for a wombat who settled disputes with more than words — creaked softly at the shoulders as he moved. His scarred paws were clasped behind his back.

Opposite him, perched on a high stool that looked uncomfortably like a bird's nest made of fiber-optic cables, sat Zuckbat. The Sovereign of Intelligence blinked slowly, his eyes reflecting the scrolling code of the city's surveillance grid. Before him floated a holographic ledger — cascading waterfalls of red and black numbers that only he could read, because only he controlled both the data *and* the books.

"It doesn't balance, Zuck," Vitabat said, his voice low and level — the calm of a wombat who had learned that volume was unnecessary when you carried enough menace. "The equation remains unsolved. Explain it to me before I find someone who can."

Zuckbat didn't flinch. "My data is encrypted in a root-directory you cannot access, Vita. Define 'it'."

"The North-West Support Pillar!" Vitabat slammed his paw on the nearest server rack. The rack hummed in protest. A 3D projection of a crumbling tunnel section materialized between them. Or rather, a section that *should* have been crumbling. Instead, the projection showed a perfectly reinforced archway, patched with a mixture of clay, spit, and what looked like ancient river-stones.

"According to *your* ledger," Vitabat jabbed a claw toward Zuckbat's floating numbers, "Trumbat allocated zero resources to this sector. Muskbat's drones haven't flown there in three cycles. And yet... the asset value has increased by 40%. The structural integrity is stable."

He leaned over Zuckbat's stool, his shadow falling across the smaller wombat like a foreclosure notice. "Capital cannot be created from nothing, Zuck! Someone *paid* for this repair. Someone *did* the labor. Where is the transaction? Where is the invoice? Because if it's not in your books, then either your books are wrong — or someone is operating *outside my collection zone*."

Zuckbat leaned forward, his voice a dry rustle, like wind through dry leaves. "There is no invoice because there was no actor."

"Don't give me your quantum nonsense," Vitabat snapped.

"I have eyes on every pebble in Melborow," Zuckbat said, tapping the side of his head. "My algorithms track the thermal signature of every breathing thing in the tunnels. At 02:00, the pillar was cracked. At 04:00, it was fixed. In between?"

He swiped his hand, and a video feed played on the wall. It showed the tunnel. Empty. Silent. Then, a glitch—a smear of static, a drop in frame rate—and suddenly, the pillar was fixed.

"Null-Space Movement," Zuckbat whispered. "The Resistance."

Vitabat stared at the screen. His jaw worked — the slow, grinding motion of a wombat calculating whether the thing in front of him needed to be collected or contained. "You're telling me we have a 'Resistance' that goes around... increasing property values? Doing pro-bono infrastructure work? That's not a rebellion, that's a charity!"

"It is a virus," Zuckbat corrected, his tone darkening. "They are editing the source code of the city without logging in. They are bypassing the User Interface."

Vitabat sank into a chair, his suit creaking. "Do you know what Trumbat is doing right now? He's upstairs, drafting a sermon about how the Dingoes are eating the foundations. He wants me to *collect* from the Dingo settlements in the West. A shakedown, Zuck. He wants me to lean on creatures who are getting rich off the **[[../lore#The Static (The Digital Fester)|Static Fields]]** while these... these *ghosts* represent a variance that is literally holding the roof up."

"And Muskbat?" Zuckbat asked, though he already knew the answer.

"Muskbat is trying to mint the 'concept of a wall' as an NFT," Vitabat groaned. "They are insane, Zuck. They are forcing a narrative that doesn't exist. Trumbat preaches about the roof falling while these ghosts are the ones holding the roof up."

"The Frontend is decoupled from the Backend," Zuckbat agreed. "The Sovereigns of Fire and Earth are operating on a deprecated version of reality. They believe if they shout the story loud enough, the physics will change to match it."

"But the math doesn't lie!" Vitabat slammed his paw on the server rack again. Harder. "If Trumbat keeps sending me to collect from 'Dingo Saboteurs' while the *actual* structural work is... wait." Vitabat paused. The realization washed over him like a cold plunge. "The Resistance isn't sabotaging us."

"No," Zuckbat said softly. "They are debugging."

The two Sovereigns sat in silence, the hum of the servers filling the space between them.

"If Trumbat finds out there is an unauthorized repair crew fixing his neglect," Vitabat whispered, "he will tell me to destroy them. He will order a collection on the very thing keeping his platform stable."

"And if you destroy the patch," Zuckbat added, "the system crashes. The roof falls. The servers overheat. I lose the Ledger. We lose everything."

Vitabat looked at his scarred paws — the tools of collection, of enforcement, of the cold violence that kept the Council's debt economy operational. For the first time, the hands that broke things were looking at something they could not afford to break.

"So," Vitabat said, straightening his suit. "How do we handle this 'Null-Set'?"

Zuckbat's eyes narrowed, scrolling through a new stream of data and financial records — the merged streams that only he could read, surveillance and ledger intertwined like roots. "We do not purge a beneficial glitch, Vita. We observe. We isolate. And perhaps..."

"Perhaps we ensure Trumbat never looks too closely at the North-West Pillar," Vitabat finished. "I'll redirect the collection runs to the outer sectors. Keep the enforcement visible but nowhere near the repairs."

"And I will loop the camera feed and adjust the ledger," Zuckbat said, a rare, thin smile touching his lips. "Let the Frontend preach their sermons. We will manage the database."

"The Resistance," Vitabat muttered, shaking his head as he walked toward the door. "Fixing our infrastructure for free. I should collect from them."

"You can't collect from ghosts, Vita," Zuckbat replied, turning back to his screens and his numbers.

"Watch me," the Enforcer said, though the threat lacked its usual cold.
