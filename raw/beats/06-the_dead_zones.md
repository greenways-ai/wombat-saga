## I. The One Who Waited (Second Dust-Bearer Story)

- **Cornelibat reaches for a story:** Hoebat is eleven, on the edge of his Academy years. Late evening, the kind where the city feels close. Cornelibat looking at the paw-prints in the clay wall — the history of everyone who built this place.
- **The unnamed Dust-Bearer:** The guild stopped keeping records two generations before her. What survives: a colleague's account written forty years after the fact, found in an estate clearance, passed through three pairs of paws to Cornelibat's. Each pair passed it because it was worth passing.
- **What she did:** Hired to assess a new expansion bore. She sat down on the floor. Did not move. Foreman checked at midday: still sitting. End of shift: still sitting. Filed her as *bad hire, strange wombat.* She sat through the night. Through the next day. On the morning of the fourth day, she stood up, walked to the eastern lining of an already-certified section, removed exactly one paw-width of material, and told them to redirect the bore four degrees north.
- **The outcome:** Six months later, where the original line would have run: a salt intrusion nobody had mapped. The kind that eats through sealed walls in two years and degrades quietly for twenty more. The redirected tunnel: still standing.
- **The bill:** She charged for three days' sitting and one paw-width of correction. The guild tried to reclassify the sitting as non-billable. She filed the appeal herself. Whether she won: unknown. The tunnel held.
- **What Hoebat files:** The Dust-Bearers weren't just listeners. They were makers too. The sitting was only half the work.

## II. The Commute

- **The route:** Out of the Groves, through the margin, into the Wet Bend — where water pools in the invert without a service charge, one of the last honest corners of Melborow. Past the North-West Corridor: broken lights, a Category 2 springline flag on the wall that's been there so long it has become part of the corridor's furniture rather than a message. Thirty minutes each way. Same route every day until the route becomes the architecture of thought.
- **The Academy curriculum:** Safety Grout Geometry. Static-Logic. The official position: the earth is inert material, a problem solved by correct application of formula. The instruction continues above the clay floors as if the clay were beside the point.
- **Hoebat's adaptation:** Presses paws flat anyway. Stores the hum without words — to be unpacked later when he has language for it. Under all that Grout the hum is different than the Groves: compressed, patient in a different way. The patience of something that has been waiting a long time and learned to wait without urgency. Very deep.

## III. Barnabat

- **Introduction:** Takes the seat next to Hoebat in the second week after the original occupant transfers. Watches Hoebat press his paw to the floor for thirty seconds: "Does it tell you anything useful?" "Sometimes." "Like what?" "Where the water wants to be. Whether the wall's made up its mind."
- **His character:** Smart, genuinely funny, actually curious — not performed curiosity, the kind where you've stopped needing things to come out a specific way before you're willing to look at them. Moves through the Academy the way experienced wombats move through complex ground: aware of every surface, never surprised by the terrain.
- **His father:** Senior Assessor at the Cathedral — not Cathedral Council, but close enough that the family name is current tender in every administrative conversation in the sector. Work that carries that name receives a fair hearing, the benefit of all reasonable doubts. Projects under his shadow exist in protected territory — not because rules are bent, but because the name means the work is taken seriously.
- **His first response to the drumming pot idea:** "We document it properly and I put my father in the acknowledgments. The Pre-Grid Studies department hasn't had a primary source submission in four years." — This is the opening of the invincibility.

## IV. The Drumming Pot

- **Found by accident:** Hoebat looking for North-West Corridor structural reports in the Restricted Stacks. Mis-shelved technical drawing. Found before anyone noticed it was findable.
- **The object:** *Dust-Bearer Signal Apparatus, Type VII.* High Auditor annotation, forty years old: *Superseded by Cathedral communication protocols. Obsolete.* Restricted stamp. Wide-mouthed, thin-walled, clay-fired. Internal curves built to send a struck vibration into the earth and let the earth carry it further than sound could travel through air.
- **What Hoebat recognises:** He's spent years in Morillaboo's workshop watching her bowls make the clay walls answer. This is older — the same knowledge applied to distance. The Dust-Bearers didn't just listen to the earth. They spoke through it.
- **Barnabat's plan crystallises:** His father has access to pre-Temporal Cropping survey maps with notations on them — *Anomalous crystalline formations* in the Dead Zones. Cathedral flagged them Category 1 Restricted. "If we reconstruct a functioning pot — test it, document it, demonstrate the acoustic coupling — that's a first. That's not just an academic submission. That's a guild-certification piece of work."
- **The scope:** They would need the crystal material. Pellaboo. Tallibat's boring equipment. "We're going to be famous. Academically famous. Which is the best kind." — said without irony. He means it completely.

## V. Into the Dead Zones

- **The access point:** A panel in the sub-level corridor behind a utility bracket that the maintenance schedule stopped visiting once the sections below were classified as abandoned. Nobody locked it. There had been no reason to.
- **Three levels below:** The air changes quality — not just colder, but the presence of age. The specific patience of earth waiting in the dark longer than anything above it. Tallibat's lamp makes a small circle in that patience. Beyond its edge: dark that has never been interrupted, dark before there were eyes to fail in it.
- **The walls as record:** Old digging — slight unevenness of surface, the way the profile varies with the decisions of whoever dug. The tunnels bent around changes in clay composition rather than cutting through. Wombats who had been listening to the earth rather than imposing a plan on it. Their decisions still in the walls, precise and legible, the way a note pressed into wet clay stays in the fired pot.
- **The workshop:** A chamber where two old tunnels met at an angle creating a natural alcove, walls thick enough to deaden sound from above. Barnabat surveys with meticulous eye, measures dimensions, notes clay composition: *Pre-formation clay, dark blue, exceptionally stable.* Notes run to three pages before they've put anything down.
- **The work dynamic:**
  - Barnabat documents everything in precise cipher — not to hide it, for elegance, and because a submission with private research records will look better than one without. *We're establishing scholarly provenance.*
  - Pellaboo works without measuring. Her paws know what they're looking for. The rest of them watch. There's something in the watching that feels like attending to something important.
  - Tallibat brings his boring-probe. But he's running the dig by Pellaboo's sense of the clay now, not the formula. He brings the probe to a wall and waits. "I feel it," — and he sounds genuinely surprised every time, as if each discovery is new evidence for something he's decided to believe but still can't quite credit.
  - Hoebat holds half-finished bowls and tests their voice with a striker. The work organises the weeks.
- **The tone:** Four of them, twice a week, going deeper each session. The kind of work you feel in your paws as something that matters — not because someone told you it matters but because the earth under you is three hundred years old and giving up its secrets in small careful increments.

## VI. The Prize

- **Month five:** The first crystal pocket. Pellaboo had been tracking a change in the clay for two weeks — a slight cooling, a density that spoke to her paws of something gathered and waiting.
- **The chamber:** The original diggers had cut *around* it, not through it. They had known it was here. They had preserved it.
- **The crystal:** Dark blue, fractal-edged, formations repeating their branching pattern at every scale. The lamp's light goes further in, moves slower, emerges changed. Tallibat makes a sound that is not a word.
- **The clay at the crystal's boundary:** A quality that isn't quite texture and isn't quite temperature — a specific density, as if the earth here is paying attention to itself, holding something, has been holding it in the dark for an amount of time none of them has language for.
- **The third bowl:** Two failures first — the material harder than Groves clay, less patient of error. Third attempt holds. Pellaboo works slowly, feeling the material rather than forming it. Barnabat's notes run to eight pages per attempt. *Attempt 3: wall thickness 4mm at equator, thinning to 2.5mm at rim, firing temperature reduced by judgment.*
- **The sound:** Felt first. Not heard — felt. The bone receives it before the ear. Then the ear opens to what the bone has already known: a voice that does not simplify, every part of the crystal bowl's range reaching the Dead Zone clay and the Dead Zone clay reaching back. Harmonics answering harmonics. The chamber moving.
- **The recognition:** "That's the Wail," Tallibat says. Barely audible. Not a discovery — a return. "The beginning of it," Pellaboo says. "One bowl. We'd need—" Barnabat is already writing.
- **The academic plan at its peak:** Complete reconstruction. Functioning instrument. Demonstrated acoustic coupling. Historical documentation. Oral tradition lineage (Cornelibat's stories as primary testimony). Crystal sample analysis. "They're not going to know what to do with us."

## VII. Tuesday Afternoon

- **The springline fails without warning:** The North-West Corridor springline — compromised for years, Category 2 for as long as Hoebat can remember, never fixed — fails on a Tuesday afternoon in month six. No change in the quality of the hum beforehand. No variation in wall temperature. Whatever it had been accumulating gave no outward sign. The earth was patient and still and entirely itself right up until the moment it wasn't.
- **Who was where:** Pellaboo shaping the centrepiece bowl. Tallibat testing a new crystal pocket in the forward section. Barnabat working on the submission structure. Hoebat had meant to go forward — stopped by Barnabat's question about how to frame oral testimony. Ten minutes.
- **The sequence:** The Grout-sealed sections above transfer the shock downward rather than absorbing it. The old Dead Zone tunnels, shaped by paws that followed the earth's direction, mostly move and hold. The forward section — where the earth above is thinnest, where the spring load has been longest — does not.
- **Pellaboo's voice first:** *"HOEBAT! BARNABAT! GET BACK!"* Then Tallibat: *"THE SPRING! IT'S GOING!"* They are running toward the group, not away. The specific rhythm of two wombats at full pace in a tunnel. Then the earth renegotiates. They do not reach them.
- **Barnabat:** Trapped under a collapsed crown section. Not his voice heard — the earth's translation of his movement against the new geometry. Small, frantic, alive.
- **Hoebat's action:** Paws on the collapsed wall. Listening. The window in a collapse before the geometry commits. Read the direction of the stress. Find where the material is still making up its mind. Fourteen minutes. Barnabat pulled clear. Secondary collapse beginning behind them.
- **What Hoebat is thinking as he walks out:** The documentation is intact. They have thirty pages of evidence. A functional instrument. Oral testimony. A historical argument. Barnabat's father's name in the acknowledgments. The work itself will make everything clear.

## VIII. The Corridor

- **The moment before the office:** Barnabat comes out of the Principal's office as Hoebat is walking toward it.
- **The father:** Moving ahead, composed. The posture of someone who has completed a task and completed it correctly. Paw briefly on Barnabat's shoulder — not comfort, not pressure. Just placement. *Here. Done.*
- **Barnabat:** Two steps behind. Looking at the floor. With the focused attention he usually brings to his field book — the floor has become very important, his entire world for the next ten seconds.
- **The pass:** Three metres. Two. The father gives Hoebat the brief administrative look of a wombat who has made a decision and has nothing further to discuss. Then looks past him. They continue down the corridor.
- **Barnabat does not look up.**
- **What Hoebat reads:** The slight tightening across Barnabat's shoulders. His breathing, which Hoebat knows well enough to read from ten metres. The information is complete. He goes into the office.

---

## IX. The Tally-Stone

- **The Auditor:** A High Auditor from the Cathedral with a Tally-Stone in his paw. He has not put it down since he arrived. The stone is perfectly clear. Clear stones are supposed to be undecided. This one has already decided.
- **The witness statement:** Barnabat's name at the bottom. Language too precise for a fifteen-year-old — the syntax of someone shown what the words needed to look like and given a pen. *Instigator. Ringleader. Reckless excavation. Directed subjects into an unsound forward section.* Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation. Unauthorised Structural Modification.
- **The names in the statement:** Tallibat. Pellaboo. The deaths are real. The cause has been reassigned.
- **Hoebat's understanding:** Not yet — not in the way you understand something when you've had time. He understands it the way you understand an unexpected change in the earth under your paws: as a fact that requires all your attention before you can begin to make sense of it.
- **The outcome:** Expelled from the Sector 7 Academy. The charge goes onto the record. Thirty pages of ciphered notes, crystal samples, the submission draft — none of it exists in any official account. Story complete: reckless student, unauthorized dig, tragic accident. Everything else has ceased to exist.
- **Cornelibat, when Hoebat comes home:** Goes very still. Not sadness. Recognition.
