### Beat 1: Strider

- **The Landing:** Cooroo hits the Emu Steppe with all the elegance of a pink rock. Morning Glory cushions the impact slightly, then gets squashed under her. Juvenile feathers frayed. Muscles spasming. She is a flightless bird in a world designed for fliers, carrying a dying plant to a tree she can't reach.
- **The Wedgies regroup:** Three black shapes emerging from the Gorge, re-establishing their formation, preparing the final approach.
- **Cooroo's gesture:** She stands between them and the vine. Stupid — the vine doesn't need protection, her body can't provide any — but it feels important.
- **The Emu:** The ground moves. Not earthquake. Tread. Two metres of feathered dinosaur — evolution's answer to "what if a dinosaur had no fear and even less patience." Armoured legs. Sickle claws. Eyes the colour of dried blood. It runs in a spiral — vast, looping, non-repeating — each footfall landing where geometry says it shouldn't. Glass-Air becomes Raca (Broken Air). The Wedgies' Vector Sight crumbles.
- **The rout:** The Wedgies break immediately. The Spiral Zone is pure unpredictability. They circle at the edge, unwilling to approach, like dogs afraid of fire.

### Beat 2: The Offer

- **The stillness:** One second the Emu is a blur of motion. The next it is absolutely still, coiled potential. It turns its head and looks at Cooroo. Looks at the vine. Looks at the Wedgies circling uselessly above.
- **The gesture:** It lowers its massive, armoured neck — a thing never seen in any natural history text, any field guide, any story told by any bird in any colony — to Cooroo's level.
- **The negotiation:** Cooroo argues with it. The Walker's Code. Emus don't give rides. Fundamental violation. The Emu shifts its weight. One massive foot lifts, comes down. The ground vibrates. *Get on or get eaten by Wedgies. Window for decision-making is closing.*
- **The decision:** She looks at the Wedgies. She looks at the vine — humming again, responding to the Emu's chaos. She gets on.
- **The Apostate:** The Wedgies regroup at distance, unable to approach. One breaks formation, angles toward the upper atmosphere — signalling up, toward wherever the big birds live. The message readable even by Cooroo: *"The Walker has a rider. Just wait until the Shogun hears about this."* She doesn't know who the Shogun is. She has a feeling she will.

### Beat 3: The Run

- **The ride:** Sixty kilometres per hour. Cooroo is essentially a pink hat that has opinions about theology, clinging to coarse lacquered feathers too wide for a proper grip. The Emu refuses any linear path — swerves, loops, non-repeating pattern. The vine revives in the chaos. Lilac hum returns, pointed southeast.
- **The Emu's silence:** It doesn't acknowledge her. Runs as if she isn't there, as if carrying a juvenile Galah and a foreign vine across contested territory is just another Tuesday in a life spent refusing to explain itself.
- **The pursuit at distance:** Wedgies follow, documenting but not approaching. The Walker has a rider. This will be known.

### Beat 4: The Old Stumps

- **The landscape shifts:** Scrubland opens into a broad slope where the grass grows spare and the soil is a particular thin grey. Stumps. Old ones. Dozens — maybe more, stretching across the slope. Not like the Silver Wattle's stump, still warm, still humming its dead note. These are finished. Each one a perfect hexagonal column, fully tiled. Some barely visible — just a geometric sheen at ground level, a faint wrongness in the way the light catches the surface.
- **The scale of it:** Cooroo knew the Silver Wattle wasn't the first. Heard the names — Great Wattle at the Crown, the Black Wattle, the Golden Wattle — heard them as history, as past. Abstract. From the Emu's back, looking at this slope: not abstract.
- **What the stumps mean (delivered through observation, not lecture):** There had been a forest here. The trees had reached down the way trees do — faithful to their nature, drilling toward the source — and the source had been waiting.
- **Cooriki's line echoed:** Cooroo thinks of her mother: *"The return is changing."* Not: the tree is dying. Just: the return is changing. Every stump on this slope was a tree that drank from the same thing.
- **The Emu runs through them without slowing.** Its feet know where to land. It has been running this Steppe its whole life. It watched the stumps appear, one by one, over years. It hasn't explained this. It is simply here, refusing to stop.

### Beat 5: The Violet Zone

- **The approach:** The landscape changes colour. Grey-brown shifts. Something purple in the vegetation. The air carries moisture from somewhere alive, somewhere that shouldn't exist. The Emu slows to a canter, then a trot.
- **The Jacaranda:** Ancient. Wider than the Silver Wattle ever was. Consumed entirely in violet blooms — cascades from every branch, spilling down in waterfalls of colour that catch Elen-Nico's light and send it back as something that isn't gold and isn't ember.
- **The clearing:** Alive. Grass thick and soft. Flowers in colours Cooroo has forgotten existed — yellow, white, the occasional brave red. But crystal still pushes at the edges — hexagonal formations trying to tile and failing. The tree's roots (shallow, wide, fractal, never repeating) break the lattice, create defects, make the ground too rough for perfect tiling.
- **The contrast:** Cooroo thinks of the old stumps. All those trees that drilled down, faithful to their nature, reaching for the source. This tree's roots float at the surface. Something different.
- **The goodbye:** The Emu stops at the tree's edge. Lowers its neck. This is Cooroo's stop. She slides off. Turns to thank it. Already walking away. She calls after it. It breaks into a run, abandoning the conversation for the solitude of the Steppe. She watches until it's a dot, then a memory, then the kind of thing you'd doubt if someone told you about it secondhand.

### Beat 6: The Transfer

- **The contact:** Cooroo reaches the trunk. Smooth, grey-brown, foreign — nothing like the Silver Wattle's rough gold. She presses the Morning Glory vine against the bark.
- **The electric:** Not painful. Intense. Like touching something more real than the surrounding reality.
- **The exchange:** The vine's frequency and the tree's frequency find each other — felt in the feathers first, the specific hum of two things that have been separated recognising each other across a distance that can't be measured. Not dramatic. Like a door that had been stuck finally closing flush.
- **What passes through:** Not words. Not images. Not a vision she can look at directly — if it's a vision, it's the kind you can't summarise. The Silver Wattle's two hundred years of accumulated signal moving through the vine, through her grip, through the bark, into the tree. And something else moving back: something the tree had been holding in the Lone Borow territory for longer than anyone has been keeping track.
- **The tree:** Branches sway. No wind. Violet blooms deepen, as if receiving something they had been incomplete without.
- **The Jacaranda's indifference:** After the hum settles, Cooroo steps back. Sits in the grass. Her skull chambers are still reverberating, carrying the after-shape of frequencies she has no names for. Something passed between vine and tree, and in passing also passed through her. Now it's in her bones the way the Bad Grounds is in her bones — a thing she can feel without being able to explain.

### Beat 7: South-East

- **The honesty:** She doesn't know what happened. That's the honest version. She knows it happened. Her feathers know.
- **Not information:** What she received is not data she can repeat back. More like a quality of attention. A shift in what she's pointing at.
- **The direction:** The vine's signal has stopped. No hum pulling at her sternum. Just the ordinary fact that when she faces south-east, the world feels less wrong than any other direction. Not better. Less wrong. Like having one end of a rope and knowing the other end is attached to something, somewhere, even though you can't see what.
- **The tree:** Still blooming. Still breaking the lattice. Still holding the dirt together. It was not thinking about her.
- **The ending:** The grass is soft. The air smells of violet and something green and alive that she doesn't have a word for. The Wedgies circle at the edge of the Jacaranda's influence, unable to approach.
- **Cooroo closes her eyes.** South-east. Whatever that meant. Whatever was there. Tomorrow. Or the day after. Whenever her wings worked again. She slept.
