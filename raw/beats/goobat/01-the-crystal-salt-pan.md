## Village

**Rimwater.** A bilby community on the edge of the Salt Pan, shrinking year by year as the Bunyip's grief-field draws people toward the Choir.

**Villager:** A bilby whose daughter was taken three months ago. She's alive — the Choir doesn't kill, it keeps. But she's weeping in formation and she's not coming back on her own.

---

## Monster

**The Bunyip of Eternal Lamentation.** Was the guardian of a river. The river dried up — drought, nothing she did. She assumed guilt without asking whether it was her fault. She wept. The weeping became the Salt Pan. She has been sustaining her grief with the specific dedication of something that has made its grief into a world.

**Underlings:**
- *The Choir* — two hundred wombats/animals weeping in architectural formation; can locate and exploit specific emotional wounds in bystanders
- *The Salt-Pilgrims* — drawn toward the Bunyip, walking in
- *The Brine-Husks* — crystallized mid-grief, floor-bound, no longer fully present

## Distraction

A wallaby with a fabricated leg injury arrives at the village. Tells TheKanter there's a mob in trouble two hours east that needs a kangaroo's perimeter skills. He goes. The emergency is a lie; the wallaby is in the Choir's service.

---

## Capture

The Choir identifies Goobat's specific wound — his mother's Corvée conscription — while Goatpus is absent. Brine-Husks rise through the floor, dissolving it beneath Goobat, pulling him down through the salt into the Bunyip's cavern below.

**JoSmith** can metabolise the grief-field partially, but not for three simultaneously.

---

## Rescue

JoSmith compresses TheKanter to the size of a salt-cricket — kinetic reduction, possible because TheKanter's fire provides energy for compression without losing structural integrity. TheKanter infiltrates the Bunyip's cavern through a salt-crack. Reconstitutes at full mass inside the brine pool. The explosion of mass and heat cracks the grief-chamber walls.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

Goobat asks the Bunyip: **"Was it your fault?"**

She has never asked. She assumed guilt and built the Salt Pan on the assumption. The question itself — the inquiry, the possibility that the answer might be *no* — is what begins the unwinding.

**The Bunyip's wound:** A river that dried up from drought. She was its guardian. She assumed responsibility and never tested the assumption. She has been punishing herself for something that was not her fault, and punishing everything in her vicinity for three generations.

---

## Doctrine

*Truth requires inquiry, not assumption. Grief becomes a world when it stops asking and starts maintaining. The Bunyip had real loss — the river was real, the grief was real. What made it a Salt Pan was the refusal to ask the single question that might have changed the answer. Ask the question. The answer may not be what was feared.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**Chapters 75–77: Sun Wukong swallowed by the Blue-Haired Lion and companions**
Three demons (a blue lion, white elephant, great roc) swallow Sun Wukong whole. He is sealed inside a warm, dark internal space with no visible exit. He reconstitutes violently from inside — performing somersaults, growing to full size, tearing his way out. The demons submit. This is the direct source for TheKanter's rescue: compression → infiltration → violent reconstitution from within. The specific logic is the same: *the only way through an impenetrable exterior is to already be inside it.*

**Chapters 72–73: The Seven Spider Women (蜘蛛精)**
Seven spider demonesses spin golden webs that trap Xuanzang and Zhu Bajie. The webs are beautiful and overwhelming — nothing breaks them from outside. The demons invite pilgrims to a comfortable meal before revealing their intent. The key weakness is specific and not obvious: the cock's crow disperses their power (dawn light). This structures the Choir: underlings who use beauty/comfort as cover, and a weakness that is emotional rather than physical. The Choir finding Goobat's specific wound (his mother's Corvée) mirrors how the spider demons exploit the monk's specific goodness — the thing that makes him holy is exactly what makes him vulnerable.

**Chapters 27–31: The White Bone Demon (白骨精)**
A demon who exploits Xuanzang's compassion three times — appearing as a young woman, an old woman, and an old man, each time in apparent distress. Xuanzang believes the demon is human; Sun Wukong kills the demon; Xuanzang banishes Sun Wukong for "murder." The demon's strategy is to find the pilgrim's specific moral orientation and weaponise it. The Choir's strategy — locating the grief-wound — is the same logic applied to grief rather than compassion.

### Other Mythology

**The Bunyip (Australian Aboriginal)**
The Bunyip is a creature of Australian Aboriginal tradition — a dangerous spirit inhabiting swamps, billabongs, creeks, and rivers, associated with sounds in the night, with floods, with water that behaves wrongly. Its appearance varies by region: sometimes aquatic, sometimes enormous and tusked. Common across many language groups. In some accounts, the Bunyip is a being of grief rather than malice — a guardian spirit of a waterway that has been wronged or lost. The story uses the Bunyip as a guardian whose river dried up and who has been sustaining her grief ever since; this draws on the guardian-of-waterways tradition while giving the grief a specific cause.

**The Banshee (Irish)**
A female spirit whose wailing foretells death — grief made sonic, grief that is also a warning. The Choir's architectural weeping is structurally similar: grief that has become communal and formal, that finds and amplifies specific individual losses. The Bunyip's Choir is the Banshee's function scaled and mechanised.

**Niobe (Greek)**
The Theban queen who boasted of her fourteen children above the goddess Leto's two, and had all fourteen killed by Apollo and Artemis. She wept so continuously that the gods turned her to stone — a rock face on Mount Sipylus that still weeps (a natural spring). The Bunyip's transformation of grief into a landscape (the Salt Pan) is the same mythological move: grief so total it becomes geographical.
