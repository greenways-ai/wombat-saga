# Trial 2: The Red-Back Queen of the Gilded Web

**World:** The Gilded Web — the World of Beautiful Obligation
**Thread:** Second Thread — *The Diagnostics of False Obligation*

## Village

**Threadsong.** A weaver community whose young people leave at a specific age and don't come back — or come back changed, or simply don't come back. The village is quieter every generation.

**Villager:** An echidna whose son left five years ago rather than accept an assigned obligation-thread. He chose freedom over the community's expectation and hasn't written. She doesn't know if leaving was right or wrong, and the not-knowing is the thing that lives in her.

## Monster

**The Red-Back Queen.** Built the web because she was profoundly lonely. Started with one thread of genuine obligation, kept adding. The Web grew to fill the absence. Now it contains thousands, and the Queen maintains it because the Web is the only thing she maintains. She can no longer locate where her genuine need for connection ended and her compulsion to possess began.

**Underlings:**
- *The Docents* — enthusiastic explainers of the Web's purpose and beauty; their job is to make captivity sound like belonging
- *The Weavers* — add new threads, identify and target the unthreaded; they can sense which wound to pull on
- *The Bound* — cocooned in golden thread, not unhappy, entirely without choice

## Distraction

A wallaby family is offered debt-relief (their Tally-Debt cleared) in exchange for approaching TheKanter with a fabricated mob-distress story requiring a kangaroo's perimeter skills. The story is convincing. He goes east.

---

## Capture

The Weavers identify Goobat as unthreaded — no visible obligation-thread, which makes him anomalous and dangerous to the Web's logic. They also find his specific wound: his teacher **Pellah**, taken by the Censorate, a name Goobat has never said aloud since it happened.

While Goatpus slips into the groundwater, the Weavers come through a window with Pellah's name in the thread.

## Rescue

JoSmith converts TheKanter to a frequency signal — not destroys him, transmutes him to pure kinetic frequency, a controlled transformation that TheKanter's fire makes possible. He travels through the thread-network as a signal, reconstitutes at full mass at the throne-room junction-node. The explosion when he reconstitutes shatters the central Web infrastructure.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

Inside the Web, surrounded by golden obligation, Goobat says **Pellah's name out loud** for the first time since the Censorate took him. The Queen hears it and understands: that is a real thread — one Goobat has been carrying without naming. Not fake obligation. Something actual.

When TheKanter returns and hears the name in passing, he registers it and keeps walking. This is exactly right. The name doesn't need a response. It needed to be said.

**The Queen's wound:** Loneliness. The Web grew as a substitute for genuine relationships — each new thread filling the space that an actual relationship might have filled, with none of the reciprocity. The Web gives her something to maintain. Maintenance is not connection.

---

## Doctrine

*Obligation becomes entrapment when it is imposed rather than chosen. The Web is beautiful because imposed obligation is often made beautiful — it has to be, or no one would accept it. Find the real thread: the actual attachment, the genuine responsibility, the obligation that was chosen and would be chosen again. The real thread does not need golden architecture to hold.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**Chapters 72–73: The Seven Spider Women (蜘蛛精) — the direct source**
This is the primary model for the Gilded Web. Seven spider demonesses in Pansī Cave spin golden silk webs that ensnare Xuanzang and Zhu Bajie. The webs are beautiful. The demons run a "bathhouse" as cover — inviting travellers to wash, then cocooning them. They have a symbiotic relationship with the Hundred-Eye Demon (Peng, a centipede monster) who is their protector. Sun Wukong cannot break the webs from outside; he has to find and neutralise the Hundred-Eye Demon first, then attack the spider women. The Red-Back Queen's underlings (Docents explaining the Web's beauty, Weavers adding new threads) are directly drawn from the spiders' hospitable-predator operation.

The golden thread as beautiful obligation: the spider women's silk looks like treasure. Xuanzang accepts the hospitality. This is the trap — the beauty is the mechanism, not the cover. The Gilded Web makes this explicit in its title.

**Chapter 73: The Hundred-Eye Demon (百眼魔君)**
The centipede demon who protects the Spider Women. He blinds Sun Wukong with light from his eyes (one hundred rays of light from one hundred eyes). The rooster's crow ultimately disperses his power. He is the monster-behind-the-monster: the Spider Women's real threat comes not from them directly but from their alliance. The Red-Back Queen's Weavers operate similarly — the visible threat is the web, but the real mechanism is the identification of the unwounded entry point (Goobat's unthreaded state, then Pellah).

**The Golden Headband (金箍兒)**
Given to Sun Wukong by Guanyin via Xuanzang early in the journey — a headband that causes Wukong pain when Xuanzang recites a specific sutra, giving Xuanzang a form of cognitive control over his protector. A restraint that works through the mind rather than the body. The web-binding via named wound (Pellah) is the same mechanism: the thread doesn't restrain physically, it binds through something real that the prisoner genuinely carries.

### Other Mythology

**Arachne (Greek/Ovid)**
The mortal weaver who challenged Athena to a weaving contest. Her tapestry was technically flawless — it depicted the gods' crimes against mortals, every thread accurate. Athena destroyed it and turned Arachne into a spider. The Red-Back Queen's web is also technically perfect; the problem is not craft but the way craft became compulsion. Arachne wove because she was skilled; the Queen weaves because she is lonely and the weaving gives her something to maintain.

**Indra's Net (Hindu/Buddhist)**
In the Atharva Veda and later Buddhist cosmology, Indra's Net is an infinite net with a jewel at each vertex, each jewel reflecting all the others — a metaphor for interdependence and the interconnection of all things. The Gilded Web is the corrupted version: a net in which every thread of connection is a thread of control, not of mutual reflection. Real obligation is Indra's Net (each node freely connected to all others); false obligation is the Gilded Web (connection as possession).

**The Fates (Greek: Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos)**
Three figures who spin, measure, and cut the thread of every human life. The Weavers are a distorted version: they spin threads of obligation that should not exist, add threads that connect the unwilling, measure the wrong things. The Fates' threads are fated; the Queen's threads are imposed.
