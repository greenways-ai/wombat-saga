# The Vigil (Narrative Beats)

**Chapter:** 1 — The Vigil
**Perspective:** Cooroo (Galah, juvenile, first person)
**Chronicle-Mu Reference:** Origin of the Prophet Cooroo — The Waiting

### Beat 1: The Silent Galah

- **The Protagonist:** Cooroo, a juvenile Galah who has lost her voice. She cannot perform the Noble Noise — Laica Róma — the species-defining scream that goes out as sound and comes back as data.
- **The Covenant:** The Noble Noise is the Galah covenant with the world: you give it noise, it gives you knowledge. Without it, Cooroo is a Galah who can't fulfill her side of the deal.
- **The Failure:** Three weeks ago at the swell — the pulse when every Galah in Hún Nico screams — Cooroo opened her beak and got a ghost. The shape without the guts.
- **The Secret:** She hasn't told Mum. Mum has enough quiet of her own.
- **Voice:** Irreverent, self-deprecating, physical comedy. "It's like saying 'a river that can't flow' or 'an emu that can't stare at you until you want to apologise for existing.'"

### Beat 2: A Hollow Heart

- **The World:** Hún Nico is a heart-shaped world, inhabited on the inside. Elen-Nico (the Star) hangs at the centre, 140 kilometres up, pulsing like a heartbeat — not steadily, like a clock, but like a heart. The pause between beats goes lilac.
- **The Delivery:** Not an exposition dump — Cooroo describing the world she lives in, through her specific experience of it (staying awake for the pause, never sleeping through it).
- **The Scale:** Ground curves up. Other landmass visible overhead. The creature at the bottom of a bowl-shaped world.

### Beat 3: The Silver Wattle

- **Cooriki:** Cooroo's mother. Former Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony — could read air like a map, throw a swell-call that rode the wind gradient through three atmospheric layers. Now sits on a Eucalyptus branch and stares at where the Silver Wattle used to stand. Twenty-one days.
- **The Loss:** The Silver Wattle was the great resonant tree of the Eastern Ridge. The Rosella Choir lived in its high branches, braiding the Chorus into the air every morning. Cooroo grew up on the lower branches, not understanding what the Chorus was, just knowing it was happening.
- **The Foreshadowing:** The Rosellas left one by one before the fall — matching their part of the Song to a simpler tone coming through the wood. The canopy went quiet slowly.
- **Cooriki's Philosophy (seeds):** "We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we." Said as a mum thing. Not yet understood.

### Beat 4: The Vigil

- **The Scattering:** After the Wattle fell, the colony scattered. Callers south to Aldar Lemnë (Trees Remaining). Fliers to the Windbreak Cliffs (Ramba Súrëa) or the Lone Borows. Cooroo stayed — wings too young for distance, too stubborn to say so.
- **The Stump:** Enormous. Pale. Fractured right down the middle. The horizontal cut jagged with quartz-like breakages. The Silver Wattle wasn't cut down — it shattered.
- **The Sound:** The crystal cracked like thunder. Every Galah for fifty kilometres heard it. Every wombat in their tunnels felt it in their paws. And Cooroo's voice went quiet too — not because the silence was wrong, but because that thunder was the answer.
- **The Geometry:** Wood doesn't fracture into hexagons. It did. Each fragment a perfect hexagonal prism. Cooroo bled on one and the blood ran off without soaking in. She checked the angles anyway — 120 degrees, exactly — because if the numbers held, this would be physics. Tragedy with rules.

### Beat 5: The Bad Grounds

- **The Context:** The Bad Grounds has been there Cooroo's whole life. The sheen on the western slope. The place you don't land.
- **The Physics (through behavior):** A sickening tessellation of near-hexagons. The variation isn't the organic mess of life — it's the cold deviation of a machine with a flaw in its code. Not trying. Expanding. The lattice doesn't arrive. It's arriving. One cell at a time.
- **The Contrast:** One hexagon close up is almost beautiful. The slope — half-tiled, still failing — is worse. It's a promise.
- **Cooroo's physical reading:** "My feathers go flat every time I look at it, and a Galah who ignores his feathers is a Galah who walks into walls."

### Beat 6: The Underground

- **The Official Story:** The Yellow Monsters came, and then the tree fell. External force. Something to point at.
- **The Truth:** The wombats did it. A series of well-intentioned decisions made underground over three seasons. Their Grout — dead earth-glue — set in straight lines below the root system. The ground got quieter. The bark cracked in lines too straight to be natural.
- **Cooroo's witness:** She felt the vibrations change through her claws. The lower leaves yellowed in thin, papery gold — not the warm gold of the Wattle bloom. Cooriki ran frequency checks every morning. Her feathers said bad news. "The return is changing."
- **The Tragedy:** The blooms kept coming right on schedule. From a distance, the tree looked fine. You had to be a Galah on a lower branch, claws on the bark, paying attention.
- **The silence:** Then it fell. And the silence took Cooroo's voice with it.

---

### Beat 7: The Concentrated Sky

- **The Discovery:** Twenty-first morning. At the edge of the Bad Grounds — the ragged tear where dirt and crystal are still fighting — a Morning Glory vine. Thin as wire. Three heart-shaped leaves. Growing up a fragment of the shattered Wattle.
- **Heart-shaped leaves. In a heart-shaped world.** Cooroo doesn't know if it means something. Her feathers think it does.
- **The Flower:** Lilac. The exact colour of the pause between Elen-Nico's beats. The pause Cooroo has stayed awake for her whole life.
- **The Parasite:** In the old ways, the Morning Glory was a Resource Parasite — a weed with no deep roots that stole water from the Wattle. Because it had no deep roots, it wasn't connected to the poisoned source. It survived.
- **The Recognition:** The vine has rooted into a crack in the crystal Wattle fragment — a flaw where a crumb of real dirt lodged. Threading itself into the dead tree's body. A living vine on a dead tree.
- **The Understanding (in feathers, not words):** Blue, squeezed hard enough, turns lilac. The sky, pushed into a space as small as a flower, shifts. It doesn't break. It changes. That's what the Morning Glory is showing: the sky survives concentration. It just comes out a different colour.

### Beat 8: The Voice

- **The Signal:** Over seven mornings, the vine speaks. Not in words — in resonance, in the vibration that arrives in the feathers before the thought arrives in the head. Coming up through dead roots, through the living vine, through the colour, into Cooroo's chambers.
- **The Direction:** South-east. Past the Ridge, past the Burnt Scrub, past the Gorge. Somewhere out there — something alive, rooted, conducting through living wood. A tree. With a violet bloom. A Jacaranda.
- **The Decision:** Not thought through. Feathers know. Cooroo is done arguing with her feathers.
- **The Scream:** Terrible. The worst scream in Galah history — raw, cracked, graceless, a gate hinge in a cyclone. The first sound in five weeks. It fills the morning completely, gracelessly, without caring whether it's beautiful.
- **The Response:** Three hundred metres away, on her Eucalyptus branch, Cooriki's crest goes up. She turns her head. First time she's turned toward anything since the Silver Wattle fell.
- **The Ending:** She doesn't fly to Cooroo. Not yet. But she looked. Just a bird turning her head. And it was the loudest thing Cooroo had heard since the tree came down.
