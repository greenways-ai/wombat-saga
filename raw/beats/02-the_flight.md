# The Flight (Narrative Beats)

**Chapter:** 2 — The Flight
**Perspective:** Cooroo (Galah, juvenile, first person)
**Chronicle-Mu Reference:** Origin of the Prophet Cooroo — The Journey

### Beat 1: The Departure

- **The Action:** Cooroo launches from the shattered Silver Wattle stump with the Morning Glory vine gripped in her claws. Cooriki's crest is still up — the first time in twenty-one days she'd turned her head.
- **The Physical Reality:** Wings still too short. Body "the aerodynamic profile of a feathered grapefruit." The vine is heavier than it looks and hums against her talons like a live electrical wire that happens to photosynthesize.
- **The Pull:** The vine insists southeast. A deep internal wrongness that grows the longer she stands still. She jumps.
- **No proper goodbye:** Saviours don't get those.

### Beat 2: Into the Heavy Breath

- **Thúlë Lunga (Heavy Breath):** The lowest atmospheric layer. Dense, humid, mud-scented. The only layer Cooroo is technically rated for. She flaps too desperately — the wingbeats of a bird who hasn't learned distance technique. She finds a southeast air current (Rómen-Sírë, East-Flow) and locks into it. Vine hum steadies to a drone.
- **Two hours flying:** Wings burn. Chest heaves. Then her feathers start to flatten — and she notices because it's the wrong kind of flat. Not Bad-Grounds flat (Static in the substrate changing the electrical quality above it). This is cleaner. Colder. Streamlining. Trying to make her geometric.

### Beat 3: Cookeerik and the Law-Wind

- **The trigger:** The feathers flattening in the cold upper air bring back Cookeerik's voice directly — the farthest flier in the colony before his wings gave out. He used to hold court on the mid-branches, his pink faded to dusty rose from too much time in the upper atmosphere.
- **Cookeerik's knowledge (delivered as memory, not exposition):**
    - *"Up here, you can feel the difference between the air that carries life and the air that carries geometry."*
    - The Lusta Ómëa (Frequency Void) — above the Law-Wind. Air almost nothing. Elen-Nico's frequency loudest. *"Not a sound you hear with your ears. Every feather vibrating. The living version of what the lattice is the dead version of."*
    - He got close enough his pink shifted toward lilac. Then his wings failed and he fell nine kilometres.
    - *"No bird has reached Elen-Nico. No bird ever will. But we're the species that gets closest, and getting close to a thing you can never reach is the whole point of being a Galah."*
- **The realisation:** Cooroo is in the Súrë Axan (Law-Wind) now. Her feathers told her without her needing to check.
- **The landscape from height:** The Bad Grounds looks smaller from up here — but it has cousins. Patches of hexagonal sheen scattered across the ridge face, visible only from altitude. From the ground it was a fact. From up here, it's a direction. The world moving toward something.

### Beat 4: Vector Sight

- **The Wedgies:** Three Wedge-tailed Eagles. Perfectly spaced. Perfectly silent. Appear as a disturbance in the air — too orderly, too patterned.
- **Their nature:** Vector Sight — they don't see birds, they see trajectories. Probability cones. They fly in Glass-Air (tiled air that carries them predictably). They love the Static because in a fully crystallised world every trajectory would be calculable. They'd finally be able to relax.
- **Zero imagination:** You could tell one the best joke in avian history and it would calculate the vector of your voice and determine whether you represent a caloric investment worth pursuing.
- **The lock-on:** Cooroo feels them calculate her mass, velocity, juvenile wing efficiency. Subject: suboptimal. Trajectory: erratic. Disruption to laminar flow: maximal.
- **The herding:** The northern Eagle shifts wing angle three degrees — blocks the thermal route upward. Southern Eagle cuts off retreat. The notched Eagle (one notch in its left primary feather, the only distinguishing mark in their perfect uniformity) positions exactly where Cooroo needs to go.
- **No way out:** Every direction she turns, a three-degree adjustment closes the gap. The vine pulls southeast. Southeast is where the notched Eagle waits.

### Beat 5: Weathertop

- **The Drop:** Cooroo folds her wings and drops — surrendering to gravity, violating the Eagles' probability calculations. They overshoot. She crashes into the Shattered Gorge crevice wall.
- **The Trap:** She lands on a ledge. The vine wilts immediately — it needs Arnam-moisture, and the Gorge is dry crystal. The Wedgies perch at the top of the crevice in an equilateral triangle. They don't enter — confined spaces violate their geometric principles. They wait. Geometry, as always, is patient.
- **The discovery:** The vine twitches. Points toward a darker section where crystal formations are thinner. Cooroo squeezes through into a small chamber. Water — a seep, moisture bleeding from a crack the Static hasn't fully claimed. She plunges the vine's roots in. Hum returns.
- **The trap closes:** The notched Eagle appears at the gap. Can't fit through, but can wait. The Wedgies are re-establishing formation above.
- **The idea:** The crystal walls are resonant. The Noble Noise, focused by chamber geometry, strikes the crystal at its resonance frequency — a very specific note Cooroo hits by accident because she has no training and even less control.

---

### Beat 6: The Scream

- **The weapon:** Cooroo unleashes the ugliest, most fractal, most deliberately messy sound she can produce — not a frequency check or mapping scream, but raw chaos. The scream from the stump, amplified by desperation and crystal chamber acoustics.
- **The result:** Ten metres of half-formed hexagonal lattice explodes into quartz dust. The chamber fills instantly. Vector Sight depends on clear air — the dust scatters everything. Light. Trajectories. Probability. The Wedgies are blind.
- **The escape:** Cooroo runs. Galahs run the way they do most things: with determination, poor grace, and surprising speed given their body shape. The collapsed wall has created a new exit — jagged, rough, completely un-geometric. She bursts into open air.
- **Immediately crashes.**
