### Beat 1: The Grotto — Reading the Body

- **The Setting:** Gray Grotto district of Melborow, underground wombat city. Rain that doesn't fall — it settles, like a bad landlord. Rust and someone else's unpaid maintenance bill.
- **The Characters:**
    - **Hoebat:** Root-Digger. Reads infrastructure the way a doctor reads a body — not from a chart, from paws on earth. He knows the difference between substrate that wants to hold and substrate that's made its peace with collapsing. He helped build the city that's killing the city.
    - **Lolaboo:** Queensborow. Upper levels, working drainage. Believes the Frequency is talking *to* her. Reads "emerging district with character" and hears something other than a eulogy.
- **What Hoebat sees in the alley:** The sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down. The hairline fracture where water has been pooling. And in the foundation cracks — the blue-white geometry of Static colonisation, hexagonal and precise, working upward from below. "This building isn't dying. It's converting."
- **The infrastructure critique (from personal knowledge, not lecture):** Hoebat helped install the weep lines that fed the Frequency cables. He saw the maintenance schedules that were never honoured. He knows the decision to cap the relief drains to make room for utility conduits because the Frequency was making someone rich. He called the original work progress. He was younger and less honest with himself then.
- **Temporal Cropping:** Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code. Systematic reduction of services, staged over months, designed to prompt voluntary departure. "Voluntary." As if a wombat choosing between a leaking roof and no roof is making a free choice.
- **The Glow-Panels:** Bioluminescent tiles powered by the Frequency, broadcasting as they illuminate. Every light is also a speaker. The Council's great innovation: infrastructure that talks at you while it serves you.

### Beat 2: The Frequency Dies

- **The cut:** The Melborow Frequency — the constant low-grade thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment in the city — cuts clean. Gone. Like a hand leaving a cheek.
- **Lolaboo's app dies.** Blue light gone. Two shapes under a rusted awning.
- **The underground silence:** Surface creatures never know this. Silence underground has weight. Fills the ear like clay. In the space the Frequency just vacated, if you've spent your working life with your paws against earth — you can hear the real thing. Deep. Geological. Slow. The sound the Frequency was built, in part, to cover.
- **The Lost Dingoes:** Three shapes from the storm drain. Lean. Rib-thin. The particular grace of an animal with nothing left to lose. Scavengers.
- **Fear has a geography.** It flows downhill. Pools at the lowest point. Right now, that's them.

### Beat 3: The Campfire (Flashback)

*Triggered as Hoebat reaches back into memory for the one thing he knows about Dingoes that isn't textbook.*

- **Lambda class, third night:** Scattered across the dry plains with a waterskin and the instruction to "maintain composure" — which translated differently depending on species. Pokero: don't hunt the Wallabies. Hoebat: don't dig a hole and wait for the sun.
- **The last two in the sector:** The others made it back. Pokero and Hoebat stayed. They'd run enough scenarios together to know each other's tells — he went quiet when hunting, Hoebat dug when anxious. Neither commented.
- **Pokero's philosophy (delivered as teaching, not lecture):**
    - *"Haiku are pocket-sized vibes. We collect them and detonate them on each other."*
    - *"They don't broadcast. They precipitate. You're not sending anything out. The room already has it. You're just making it impossible to deny."* — his Australian Twister cadence, rapid and technically precise.
    - Dingo culture isn't about territory — it's about flow state. Fifteen syllables is the blade. A bitten leg heals. A broken ego doesn't.
    - 3-7-5. That's where the flow lives. Mostly in Quenya (Pack-Talk), but *"there's a truth in the dirt that polished stone doesn't have."*
- **The haiku battle:** Five exchanges. Each one escalating. Pokero's opening insult: *"Wombat feet / Masked with clay. All day. Pewtrid / Noses do not lie."* Hoebat's counter: *"Dingo dreams / What red rider? What sharp teeth? / Hood up. Wolf down. Shanked."* They go round by round. The stakes get real. The final private exchange:
    - Pokero: *"Fat paws dead / Blinded by the hollow root / Graveyard for a home."*
    - Hoebat (after walking the scrub with it): *"Shun the light / Reaping where dingoes are blind / Shadows hold our lives."*
- **The moment:** Not the brother's oath. Not navigating the Shattered Gorge blind. *That* night, on the dry plains, with cricket-song in every pause — that was when Hoebat knew Pokero was his friend.

### Beat 4: The Warning

- **Back in the alley.** The lead Scavenger lunges — scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline.
- **Section 8.2:** Hoebat drops his center of gravity. Finds the wet concrete. Squares his shoulders. Load-bearing stance — *I am not moving. Try the physics and find out.*
- **The Watcher's Frequency:** *Click-clack, hiss, pause.* Then Dingo-Tongue, harsh vowels scraping out: *"Bone is dry. Marrow gone. Seek the Dying. Hunt not the Living."*
- **The freeze:** The Scavenger stops. The Code is in him somewhere under all that hunger — visible in the way his ears swivel back. Something fighting something. The hunger winning.
- **Pokero's entrance:** The air changes before he's visible. Something larger. The Scavengers feel it first. One sharp yelp — command, dismissal — and they scatter like smoke.
- **Pokero harder in the city.** Sharper. Country dust gone, Melborow grime in its place. But the eyes — golden, patient as a held breath — the same.
- **The Wall:** Trumbat's concrete ribbon against a sky the colour of a bruise. Pokero has seen the schematics. Sat in the meetings. *"He calls it 'civic armature.' That Wall isn't for keeping things out. It's a lid."*
- **The Grotto:** *"This place is dead tissue. We hunt here because there's nothing left to damage. The Council isn't neglecting it. They're finishing it off."*
- **The haiku pass** (voice drops — no announcement):
    > *Shun the rot.*
    > *Seek not, for dingoes do hunt.*
    > *Your walls hold your dead.*
- **Gone.** Rain and shadow. Anger and gratitude in the same chest — the way they always sit when someone you love does something you needed and didn't want.
- **Frequency returns.** Sickly yellow. App reboots. Cheerful chime: *Seventy meters. Great investment opportunity.*
- **"We're not buying here, Lolaboo."** — "The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies." Already walking.

### Beat 5: The Cipher

- **The grinding stone:** Walking through rain-soaked alleys. Two haikus working against each other, edges catching.
- **The vibe resonance (before the analysis):**
    - Thirty seconds before Pokero appeared, Hoebat had been running the campfire verse in his head — *Shun the light. Reaping where dingoes are blind. Shadows hold our lives* — as a survival tool, the way Pokero taught him. Tune to the right vibe, hold it, don't break.
    - Pokero felt it. Not from explanation, not from signal — *felt* it. From somewhere in the dark and the rain, before he'd shown his face, he'd felt the exact verse playing in Hoebat's head and answered it.
    - Pokero's own words, years ago by the fire: *"They don't broadcast. They precipitate. The room already has it. You're just making it impossible to deny."* — That's what happened.
- **The analytical layer (surface read):**
    - *Light* becomes *rot*. *Reaping* becomes *seek not*. *Shadows* become *walls*. A tonal shift — endurance to urgency. Pokero moving the register up a notch. That's the surface, and he knows Hoebat will go deeper.
- **The real message — what stayed:**
    - Filter out the variables. Hold the constants: *...the dingoes... ...hold...*
    - **The dingoes hold.** Not position — the pact. The oath taken under the Jacaranda. Pokero's faction — the ones who still know the Code, still battle in fifteen syllables instead of teeth — holding to the Kappa Mu.
- **The second line hits properly:**
    - *Seek not, for dingoes do hunt.* — Not *seek not where*. A comma. A full stop. Then the reason: *for dingoes do hunt.* Don't look for us. We are already looking. We are already moving.
    - This is not an activation signal telling Hoebat to go find Pokero. It's telling him to hold ground. The dingoes are on the hunt. They will find him.
- **The implications:**
    - Kappa Mu already in motion. Something happened — something that put Pokero in a Council meeting, watching Trumbat's schematics, deciding today was the day to break cover.
    - The others — Bash, Cooroo, Merl — getting their own signals, in their own languages? Pokero wouldn't move the whole board unless all five were needed.
- **The ending:**
    - Trumbat is building a lid. The Frequency is singing everyone to sleep inside it. The Static is working its geometry up through the foundation cracks while the Tallies refuse to name what it is.
    - Cooroo screaming at dawn in the bush. Bash with his hands in somebody else's disaster. Merl running whatever the long game is. All of them doing their own separate thing while the ground shifts under all of them.
    - **Hold position. The dingoes have come.**
