## I. The Ceremony

- **The exclusion:** A Council hall in Sector 7. Grout-sealed walls, formula-straight bores, regulated light. The kind of space that announces by its architecture what kind of grief it will permit. Hoebat arrives at the start of the third mourning period. A Council Compliance Officer stands at the door with a list. "You're not permitted to enter."
- **What Hoebat sees through the doorway:**
  - **Tallibat's father:** Front row. Broad-backed. Shoulders squared — the posture of someone holding the correct understanding of what happened to his son with both paws because the alternative is nothing. His wife, very still, does not turn.
  - **Barnabat and his father:** Two rows behind. Father upright, performing grief correctly, as you perform everything correctly when your name is the credential. Barnabat beside him, looking straight ahead. He knows Hoebat is in the doorway — he has always had the quality of knowing where everyone in a space is positioned. He does not look. Father glances once toward the door: not the administrative corridor-look, something that has already moved past the decision to the place beyond it. Then back to the ceremony.
  - **Pellaboo's family:** Near the back. Morillaboo sits with one paw in her lap, one pressed flat to the floor. Even here, in a Grout-sealed hall, she is still listening. She looks up. Sees Hoebat. A moment of complete stillness — she knows, can't say so, can't look away, can't help. She looks away.
- **Pellaboo's family's situation:** The Council notified them two days before the funeral. Unregistered residence. Thirty days to relocate to assigned grid housing in Sector 11. No margin access. No surface-access ladder. No kiln, no pre-formation clay, no workshop. The singing bowls — the ones Tallibat struck for two hours the afternoon he changed — will not transfer. Assigned grid housing in Sector 11 has no place for a kiln that predated the grid's light infrastructure. The Council did not need to say *this is part of the price.* The address was the price.
- **The file-out:** Families pass one by one. Each face makes the same calculation: seeing Hoebat, knowing, looking ahead and continuing. Not hate. Not accusation. The specific expression of people who understand that the official record is the only protection they have left and looking at Hoebat would cost something they cannot afford.
- **Tallibat's father:** Has to move around Hoebat slightly in the narrow corridor. In that moment, close enough to see the tool-calluses on his digging hand, he looks at a point on the wall slightly above Hoebat's right shoulder. Maintains it for the three seconds it takes to pass. He knows. He doesn't know what to do with what he knows. The Council has ensured there is nothing to do with it.
- **Morillaboo last:** Stops in front of Hoebat. Stands four or five seconds — long enough that the Compliance Officer takes a step forward. She looks at his paws. Not his face. His paws — still clay-marked from the fourteen minutes of digging Barnabat clear. She looks at them the way she looks at a bowl before she strikes it: reading what's there. Then walks past down the corridor. He doesn't see her again for a very long time.

## II. The Crack That Heals

- **Home:** Neither Cornelibat nor Agathaboo has slept. The burrow has the particular quality of two wombats pretending, neither pretending well enough.
- **Hoebat's expectation:** He thought perhaps this was too large for stories — that they'd have to sit with it, which he has no idea how to do.
- **At dawn:** Cornelibat makes tea. "Come here, Hoebat. Sit. The eucalyptus is showing its silver undersides — wind's changing."
- **The story:** There is a type of crack that runs with the grain of the material. Following the direction the earth naturally wants to move. Looks like failure — an inspector reaches for the Grout immediately. But what it actually is: the earth healing. The material returning to where it wants to be. Leave it alone and it seals itself.
- **The other kind:** Against-grain. Different geometry. Those need hands on them.
- **The lesson:** A grain-running crack sealed with Grout cannot do what it was doing. Six years, eight years, the stress has nowhere to go. The tunnel fails. The Grout-inspector's report says: see, the crack was the problem. We sealed it. Something else must have failed.
- **The line:** "The crack was the solution."
- **The instruction:** "Keep your head down."

---

## III. The Hypocrite

- **The argument:** Hoebat has been raised on Dust-Bearer stories. Night after night, clay walls, no registration, the earth speaks and the only job is to listen. And now the man who told him that is telling him to be quiet.
- **Hoebat's logic:** You told me the tunnel failed because someone sealed the thing that was healing it. You told me the inspector sealed the crack because it *looked bad.* And the sealing was what killed the tunnel. Not the crack. And now you're telling me to be the Grout.
- **Cornelibat's response:** "That's not what I said."
- **The diagnosis:** Not an insult — a diagnosis. The Council sealed Cornelibat. He lost his certification, his guild, twenty years of his career. Ended up in unregistered clay because they put Grout over a grain-running crack and called it fixed. And now the crack is standing in his burrow at dawn telling him what happened to it. And he's telling it to comply.
- **Cornelibat's counter:** "You are fifteen years old." — "I know how old I am." — "I know what a number like that does to a life. I know, because I am living it." His voice stays completely level — not calm, the level you reach through having been through the thing so many times it no longer spikes. "I am not telling you to stop believing what you believe. I am telling you that they will take everything if you give them a reason."
- **Hoebat's response:** "They already took everything. Tallibat is dead. Pellaboo is dead. The crystal bowl she was shaping is buried under thirty tonnes of pre-formation clay. The record says I sent them in there. Barnabat signed his name to that because his father's name is worth more to his family than I am. What exactly is there left to protect?"
- **Cornelibat's silence:** He doesn't answer. That's the part Hoebat can't get past — not the advice, but the silence after it runs out. The moment when there's nothing left to say because he's right and Hoebat's right and both things are true at once and they both know it and neither can make them fit together.
- **"You're a coward."** — Not an insult. A diagnosis. Hoebat is fifteen and thinks naming the correct problem is the same as beginning to solve it. He is wrong about that. He is not wrong about the diagnosis.
- **Cornelibat does not argue.** That is the moment — not the charge, not Barnabat, not the pre-decided stone. The moment Hoebat understands there is a kind of damage that goes deep enough it stops defending itself.

## IV. What Was Buried

- **Return to the workshop:** Back through the maintenance panel in the sub-level corridor. The Cathedral took Barnabat's statement and never looked deeper. The story was complete. What they'd been building had ceased to exist for official purposes.
- **What he gathers:** Pellaboo's crystal bowl — cracked in the collapse's aftermath, still holding its form. The unfired signal pot. Tallibat's notes on how the crystal sang in the deep clay, written in his careful formula-trained hand. Barnabat's ciphered field book — observations better than anything the Academy's courses produced, from a wombat who chose his family's name over those observations and who was probably right to, and whom Hoebat will spend years not hating because hating him would have required believing he had a real choice.
- **Pellaboo's line:** *The crystal wants to go in a direction.* Said while shaping the bowl, half to herself. He'd assumed she meant the material's response during firing. Holding the bowl in the dark workshop, he thinks maybe she meant something else.
- **The crystal myths — three stories that circulate in the commute:**
  1. *They're growing.* Started when the major Grout seals went in sixty years back, accelerating since. Sealed earth can't breathe, so it does something else. Some versions say spreading toward the Academy basement. Some say toward inhabited sectors. Some say the Cathedral knows — that the restriction flags are about the crystals specifically, not the structural grade.
  2. *The bowls push them back.* A maintenance worker who'd run the sub-level before the Dead Zones were reclassified noticed: growth nearest the old workshop spaces ran different. Lighter. Where sound had been made regularly — where the old bowls had been used — the crystals were sparse, almost retreating. Where the Grout went in and the sound stopped: dense and branching and blue. The Cathedral has put nothing about this in any public document.
  3. *Something's down there.* Three different kids, three separate tellings, all delivered flat — no performance, someone reporting what they saw. Go past the fourth level, past the chamber they'd been working in, and the lamp feels wrong. Not dim — wrong. Like the light arrives slightly after it left. And you feel watched. Not afraid. Present to something that is present to you.
- **Hoebat had felt it himself:** Fifth month, twenty paces past the limit of where the crew usually worked. He followed a cold in the walls that didn't match anything they'd mapped. Stopped when the feeling arrived. Not threat. Something attending. Paws flat on the tunnel floor, the earth's attention the way he'd felt it in the Groves as a child — except larger. More deliberate. He went back without saying anything.
- **The charge and Morillaboo's look:** The charge said he had caused that. The charge had never been in the forward section. Morillaboo at the ceremony — looking at his paws, not his face. The clay still on them from the fourteen minutes of digging Barnabat clear. She was reading the only thing in that corridor that still told the true account of what happened underground.
- **The answer is not above:** No appeal, no administrative review, no Council hearing. The decision had been made. That version exists now. Nothing above the old springline's depth is going to change it.
- **Single Hangbat seed:** Cornelibat had said Hangbat was underground. Somewhere in these tunnels.
- **The close:** Choose accurate. Below was accurate.

## V. Downward

- **The descent:** Not a plan — wombats don't plan their way into the earth, they go when the surface has stopped being the place where anything true is happening. Not escape either. Direction.
- **What pulls him:** The kids' stories about the crystals. The feeling of being watched in the fifth month. Pellaboo's bowl in his pack. The unfired signal pot that no one above would ever let him fire. If there's something down there attending, he has, at minimum, the right equipment to attend back.
- **Below is the only direction that points toward the truth. Everything above points toward that version.**
- **The route:** North-West Corridor past where the school route ended. The dead lights he walked under every morning for four years. Below the failed springline: seepage tracing new paths in the clay, following the old logic — water finding the direction it wanted, regardless of what had been sealed above it. The earth renegotiated.
- **The infrastructure ends:** Below the breach, no boring-profile, no chalk lines. The walls change: from machine-smooth flatness to the slightly uneven, slightly organic surface of material that was read before it was worked. Old digging. Tunnels bending to follow seams. Narrowing not because a boring machine set the width but because the earth here was doing something the digger had decided not to interrupt.
- **The old diggers:** Dead for a long time. Their decisions still in the walls. Hoebat moves through them in the small circle of his lamp's knowing. The dark beyond: complete in a way that grid-tunnel dark is not — the dark that has never been interrupted, that was dark before there were eyes to fail in it.

## VI. The Root Cathedral

- **Found by sound, not map:** Three levels below the Academy's foundation. A whisper at one end arrives at the other as something else — not echoed, transformed. Richer. The chamber's geometry has its own grammar: takes what you offer and returns something more.
- **The walls:** Root-paths — long dead, or severed by the city pressing its foundations down from above. Not round, not straight: fractal. The geometry of growth rather than construction. The wall records every decision the root ever made about where to go, down to the smallest filament's pressure against the clay. A library of choices, all made in the dark, all reading the earth rather than imposing on it.
- **Three days:**
  - First day: learning the chamber's shape — paws first, then ears, then the sense in the deep parts of the chest that has no name but is always the most accurate. Slept where the root-paths on the floor made a kind of bed.
  - Second day: understood the chamber has a memory. Not mystical — a space shaped over centuries by living things carries the record of everything it has been. The roots were gone. Their paths remained. He was sleeping in the record of their lives.
  - Third day: took out Pellaboo's cracked crystal bowl. Struck it once with the wrapped striker.
- **The Wail found:** The sound didn't echo. It coupled. The root-path geometry found something in the bowl's full voice and answered — not one note, all of them. The bowl's complete range reaching the cathedral's stone and root and clay, the cathedral returning each voice changed, adding its own part. Felt first through the soles of the paws, up through the small bones. Then the ear opened to what the bone had already known.
- **"Not ceremony. Not ritual. Not mythology."** Just: the right instrument, the right space, the earth remembering how to listen.
- **What Hoebat understands:** What Tallibat had been measuring. What Pellaboo had been shaping toward. What the signal-pot drawing had been preserved for. The Dust-Bearers found the spaces where the earth sang back, and built instruments for the conversation.

## VII. The First Repair

- **Not for anyone.** Not for the official record. Because the walls are cracking — the city's weight shifting above, old seams opening — and he knows how to read a crack.
- **The method:**
  - Grain-running cracks: left alone. The earth returning to where it wants to be. Touch these and you stop the healing.
  - Against-grain cracks: addressed with the clay itself. Press the material back toward where it wants to go — not Grout, just the same clay as the wall. The work requires the kind of attention that starts in the body and works outward: not thinking about what your hands are doing, but letting your hands know the wall before you decide anything.
- **The irony:** The charge on his record says he caused a collapse. He works daily in the sections the system wrote off, doing the thing the system says caused collapses. The walls hold.
- **The grief:** Moves through him at its own pace, unrelated to anything he's doing. Sometimes in the middle of a repair he has to stop and press paws flat against the floor and breathe until the ground's patient weight becomes more present than what he's carrying. Sometimes that helps. Sometimes he just waits — which is the same thing in a different posture.
- **What he keeps:** Pellaboo's bowl. Tallibat's notes — a Grid-educated wombat spending the last months of his life learning to document something the Grid had no language for. Barnabat's ciphered field book — observations worth keeping because Tallibat and Pellaboo had died trying to build something true, and that truth deserved to survive the official account.
- **Hangbat:** The name stays in the back of his mind. He doesn't know where to look. He works, listens, lets the earth keep its own records, and waits to find out what listening long enough will eventually teach him.

## VIII. The Bowl That Waits

- **Placement:** Pellaboo's cracked crystal bowl on a ledge in the Root Cathedral.
- **The crack:** Grain-running — the earth's own method applied to crystal. At its narrowest point, it has begun to seal, the material filling in slowly over the weeks. The bowl doing what the Root Cathedral walls have been doing for centuries: healing itself according to its own logic, without being asked.
- **Not as memorial:** The dead don't need memorials — the need is ours, not theirs. The bowl still sings. The crack opened new voices in it, harmonics that weren't there when the crystal was whole. Pellaboo would have noted this: *third bowl, failed, repaired — additional harmonic range, cause under investigation.* She would have been working out what caused it before the bowl finished singing.
- **Deep time:** The past is very present here — not as memory (memory is personal, subject to revision) but as record. The root-paths in the walls: the geometry of lives lived and then ended, shapes left in the clay for whatever came after. Tallibat and Pellaboo had been in this earth. Their paws had touched these walls. The earth received them and receives Hoebat and makes no distinction. All of it is the same to the pre-formation clay — a brief warm presence, moving and then gone.
- **The bowl struck:** The full voice of the crystal opens into the chamber, finds the root-path geometry, and comes back richer — carrying something of stone and dark and the three-hundred-year record of the trees that wrote this space. The walls move, imperceptibly — the specific micro-adjustment of material receiving and returning vibration. The earth answers.
- **The close:** "I kept working. I kept listening. I kept the records the Tally didn't know how to keep." And somewhere in these tunnels, Hangbat — the listener, the one who went underground before Hoebat was born — is still digging. Still reading the earth. Still practicing in the dark beneath a city that has forgotten how to hear. I would find him. Or he'd find me. Or we'd dig toward each other until our tunnels met, the way the Dust-Bearers had always found each other: not by signal, not by map. Just by following the grain of the earth toward wherever it led.
- **The final image:** The bowl sings. The chamber answers. Somewhere in the dark, Cornelibat's voice — not speaking to Hoebat, just speaking, the way he always did. The Counter Who Never Counted. The Earth That Waited. The Son Who Dug Downward. Which stories were his and which were mine — maybe they'd always been the same story. Told by different paws. In the only direction that ever made sense.
