they arrive in a cavernous land. the heart world's star has been enclosed and illuminates all the walls of the caverns. this means that there is light all the time and no one goes hungry. a tribe of echidnas love their home and they tell the troupe that.

The echidnas know that the spider is their god, maintainer of their lifestyle and so they sacrifice echidnas to keep their world going. this has been the contract.


We go into the room with the spider and her attendents. They whisper to the spider that being able to eat the flesh of Chewbat will. the echidnas are overjoyed because if they can lure the troupe as sacrifice, they will gain more pleasures in this land of plenty.

the spider decides that the best way to split up the group is to create friction. On the way to the village, a young echidna goes and stops the troupe Tekanter immediates senses evil, goes up and kills the echidna. however, it got Chewbat really upset. they have a fight and Tekanter storms off.


Tekanter is in a cavern that looks slightly like a cave of magic mushrooms, suddenly the room became just like the place where he grew up and  when he sees his long lost love hopping in the next cavern. He shouts at her chaves the mirage. finally, he see that she had bounced over to a kangaroo warren with lots of little kangaroos who looked alot like him and he suddenly softened. He was home.

The same thing happen to both Jeosmi and Goapus by beautiful representations of their ideal mates and both were led away. Finally, Chewbat was alone and suddenly he was in a room where he was in bright gold, standing in front of everyone, bowing down to his majesty. his robes have been replaced with bright gold and he was glowing, resplendently.

Chewbat laughed and said. how did you know my deepest desires oh queen of perfection.

The queen says. I see into your soul monk. you are the wisest, most powerful, most desired wombat in all the lands. when I look at you, I see the king of kings and lord of lords. join with and I will build for you a kingdom worthy of your desires.

Chewbat goes. I want an armour made of the finest gold. He immediately gets the armour. he say.
