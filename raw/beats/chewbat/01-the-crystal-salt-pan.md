# Trial 1: The Bunyip of the Crystal Salt Pan

**World:** The Crystal Salt Pan — the World of Abandoned Love
**The Rescue:** Because the keep moves and the Navigator is captured, Tekanter must find the resonant pulse of the keep itself from the inside. He releases his fire, not as a weapon, but as a expansion of heat that shatters the glass and crystal from within.

## Arrival

The troupe emerges into a world of scoured white. The cold is not a mere absence of heat; it is an active, abrasive force that seeks the life within the bone. As they step onto the glass-plain, the air is thick with a thousand melodic voices — the Choir of the Salt Pan — singing in a harmony that is technically perfect and strangely soulless, an echo of captive spirits bound to the crystal lattice. 

They feel the wind sharp against their faces as they begin the painstaking search for the Image and Song — the specific thrum that will act as a key to the next world.

## Village

**The Gourd-Borow.** A cluster of dwellings built in deep, geometrically perfect depressions. The inhabitants are silent, their movements rigid, as if they are listening to a law they cannot disobey.

A frantic, hospitable creature who maintains an immaculate home. She offers her guests warm broth and a place to rest, her eyes constantly darting toward the white haze of the Salt Pan.

**The Daughter:** A returned soul, quiet and scoured. Her skin has the translucence of salt-crust, and her movements are measured with a terrible, mechanical precision.

---

## Monster

**The Bunyip of the Crystal Salt Pan.**

She was a guardian animal — a mount — of the Royal Order of the Wattle: nine divine aspects of golden light, each with a guardian animal who bore them through the Heart Worlds. She bore one of the nine. She was, for centuries, exactly what she was supposed to be.

Then she ran.

The Windmaster — mount of another of the nine — had the same idea at the same time. They left together. Away from the Order, away from the Wattle's service, into the gap left by Mirene's distracted consciousness. They were going to live in this world together, free, nobody's mount. They were going to be together forever.

The Windmaster left. Went north. No forwarding address.

The Salt Pan is the most precisely scoured environment in any of the Heart Worlds: geometric salt formations, architectural percussion, a complete numbing of every creature who enters.

She is not in a mood; she is a climate. She operates with a precise, ancient cruelty — a coldness that isn't just the absence of heat, but the active, systematic removal of it. She doesn't just build the Salt Pan; she uses it to flay the messiness out of anything that crosses the boundary.

The Salt Pan is not her tears. It is what remains of the waterway she was guardian of before she ran: she abandoned her post for him, the water evaporated, and the salt stayed. She didn't cause this through grief. She caused it through leaving. And then she was left. And now the salt is all she has, so she has made it into something hard.

**Underlings:**
- *The Choir* — two hundred animals singing in architectural formation. Not weeping. Not grieving. The Bunyip needs them rigid and she has fashioned them so. Perfect pitch. Cold and precise. They scan the Pan for unhardened hearts.
- *The Salt-Architects* — extend the Pan's boundaries in geometric increments, build and maintain the formation-patterns
- *The Bound* — creatures who came to the Bunyip's domain and were scoured, bound, and then emotionally cauterized to ensure they can never feel surprise or longing again. They are not 'happy'; they are simplified. Each one is a living specimen of perfectly managed abandonment.

## Distraction

Tekanter, sensing a shifting thrum in the crystal foundations, goes out into the storm to investigate the source of the distortion. He believes he is securing the perimeter while the others rest.

## Capture

Unbeknownst to the troupe, the Bilby has already struck a bargain with the Bunyip. Desperate to recover her daughter — who was 'filed' into the Choir months ago for a minor deviation in rhythm — she drugs the sustenance she offers. Into the broth, she stirs a dark draught of poppies and sleeping-herbs. 

As the hearth-fire flickers, the troupe succumbs to a heavy, unnatural sleep. The Bilby, weeping, watches as the Bunyip's underlings carry the drugged and unmarred Chewbat away into the white abyss, delivering him to the Crystal throne in exchange for her child.

## Aftermath

Tekanter returns to find the borow silent and the Singer gone. The betrayal is a scent on the air. In a blind rage, he towers over the cowering Bilby, his fist raised to strike her down. He is stopped only by Goapus, who catches the blow with the fluid strength of a rising tide.

"Violence will not find the path," Goapus murmurs.

While Tekanter seethes in the corner, Goapus kneels beside the Bilby, offering her his own ration of water. He consoles her until the shame breaks and she reveals the fate that awaits Chewbat.

## The Embalming

The returned daughter speaks then, her voice a dry rattle. She describes the weeks she spent in the Bunyip's keep: immured in a glass coffin, feeling the weight of the air change as a fresh measure of salt was added each dawn. She recounts the rhythmic, soul-scouring chants that accompanied the salt, a week-long trial that slowly replaces the memory of the wet world with the purity of the scoured desert. By the seventh day, the inner song is extinguished, and the captive becomes a hollow puppet, a perfect note in the Bunyip's choir.

## Second Capture

The daughter cannot name the location of Chewbat’s imprisonment — the keep moves with the scouring wind. Goapus, realizing that the water-memory of the land is the only guide, goes out alone into the white abyss. He tracks the ancient, sub-surface riverbeds that have long since been choked with salt.

However, the Bunyip’s law is absolute. As Goapus finds the thrum of the hidden keep, he is discovered by the underlings. Having no fire to defend himself and no land to hide in, he is taken.

## The Ruse

With their navigator lost, Tekanter and Jeosmi realize that force alone cannot breach the Bunyip's shifting fortress. They devise a ruse of likeness and pulse. Jeosmi, being a master of weight and substance, shifts his internal thrum to match the hollowed rhythm of a Bilby. Tekanter, the fire-bearer, compresses his vast heat into the tiny, persistent pulse of a fly, hiding in the tufts of Jeosmi's assumed form.

The infiltration is a trial of patience. They wander into the scoured waste, offering themselves to the wind. For hours, the underlings pass them by — they are looking for specific types of 'correct' geometry. Finally, perceiving Jeosmi's mimicry of a broken spirit, the search-parties sweep them up and carry them into the dark heart of the moving keep.

## The Discovery

Inside the keep, they find Chewbat and Goapus. Goapus is bound in a cage of crystal, but Chewbat is still in the glass coffin.

The Bunyip is furious. Her week-long ordeal has come to nothing. She has measured the salt and recited the chants until her voice is cracked, but the salt will not cling to Chewbat's skin. His purity is so absolute that it offers no purchase for the scoured remains of her grief. He remains unmarred, his inner song unbroken by the abrasive law of the Pan.

Jeosmi endures the Pan's weight but cannot remove Chewbat — his presence is a physical provocation to the Bunyip. Being bound is not the same as being imprisoned. The Salt Pan has simply decided where he belongs.

---

## Rescue

Tekanter returns early — the task turned out to be simpler than described. The Bunyip did not account for this because she expected to be finished by now. He walks into the Salt Pan's structured silence and his fiery spirit is not in the scroll of the bound. The Choir cannot handle a kangaroo's fire because the Bunyip has not needed to bind one before. There is no place for him.

The gap in the silence — the uncontainable element — lets Chewbat breathe differently. He finds the edge of his binding. He walks out of it.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

The Bunyip is completing Chewbat's scourging — marking his place, recording his name, giving the precise accounting of what he is — when he says:

**"Where did the Windmaster go?"**

She stills. Not shatters. Not weeps. *Stills.*

The Choir holds its note.

She has built the most rigid environment in any Heart World. She has bound every creature## The Revelation

The air in the keep suddenly changes. It is no longer cold; it is void. The scoured world trembles as the **Divine Wattle Spirit** — the ancient embodiment of the Aldar Lemnë — descends in a shower of golden blossoms. She does not strike; she blooms.

The fragrance of Arnam fills the keep, dissolving the salt and shattering the glass coffins. The spirits of the Heart-World descend as one, stripping away the Bunyip’s scoured mask. Under this divine gaze, the Bunyip’s administratve ice melts. She shrinks and softens, her rigid geometry collapsing into a small, cuddly form — a creature of golden fur and quiet breath, her abrasive law replaced by a sudden, overwhelming warmth.

**The Bunyip's wound:** She abandoned her guardian post to run away with the Windmaster. She gave up everything for him, and he left. The Salt Pan was what remained when she abandoned a waterway and the water evaporated: not tears, but a scouring, abrasive remains. Now, subdued by the Wattle Spirit, the grief has been transmuted. She holds the Bilby's daughter no longer; she is herself a child of the golden bloom.

## The Blessing

With the Bunyip transformed and the scoured keep dissolving into a mist of gold and Arnam-scent, the Divine Wattle Spirit turns to the troupe. Her voice is the thrum of a thousand hives, warm and heavy with the promise of rain.

"You have borne the weight where others would have shattered," she murmurs, her gaze lingering on Chewbat’s unmarred spirit and Tekanter’s flickering fire. "The Heart-World remembers its own."

She reaches into the golden bloom and produces a pair of keys — ancient, resonant objects that hum with the frequency of the path ahead. One she gives to Chewbat, the other to Tekanter. With a final breath of Arnam, she blesses their travel, her presence fading until only the soft, warm scent of the wattle remains in the cooling air of the Salt Pan.

The first trial is complete.

## The Divine Descent

Chewbat begins to sing — not deliberately. The question opened something, and the stillness opened something further, and the salt formation around him still carries the residual frequency of the waterway this place once was, and he is a Singer.

The Song comes up through the salt. Not his song — the node's original pulse. The Wattle's spirit, still present in the ground beneath the salt, in the water-memory of the soil that once held a living river.

The Bunyip, who has made herself into a perfect hollow vessel — who has removed everything that might interfere, who has emptied herself of everything except control — becomes a channel.

One of the nine aspects of the Royal Order of the Wattle descends through her. She becomes a vessel — a tea cup for something enormous and golden and very old. She cannot stop it because stopping would require something left inside her to push against, and she has scoured everything away.

The divine presence is brief and specific. It does not punish her. It does not welcome her back into service. It says, through her body, in the voice of the original waterway: *you are still the guardian. The waterway still exists. The water can return.*

Then it is gone.

The Bunyip is left standing in her perfectly scoured Salt Pan, in a cruel stillness, having been used as a vessel for the thing she ran from, in front of a guest, with the Choir holding its note and no name for what just happened.

---

## Image and Song

**Image:** During the descent, Chewbat sees the original river beneath the salt — the waterway before the Bunyip abandoned it, living water running through here before it evaporated. He holds the sight of it: its specific colour, the sound of movement in a place of stillness, the true face of a node beneath its surface distortion. He carries this in his chest.

**Song:** The pulse the Wattle descended on — the node's original tone, the spirit of this crossing-point before it became a Salt Pan. When the divine passed through the Bunyip, it produced a tone Chewbat recognizes as the key. He holds it in his throat.

With both, the Salt Pan's crossing-point opens. He walks through it into the next world.

The Choir watches him go. The Bunyip watches him go. She is not moved. She marks him under: *Departed. Disturbed peace. Left a question without an answer. Left through a door that was not meant to open.*

---

## The Ruby

At the edge of the Salt Pan — not inside, not approaching, watching from the perimeter — there is a presence that is not the Choir. A red-back spider, large, specific, wearing the quality of something that used to be attached to something else.

This is the Queen. She was the Bunyip's ruby: the insignia of the Royal Order of the Wattle that the Bunyip wore when she was a guardian mount. When the Bunyip ran, she shed the ruby. Left it behind at the edge of the waterway.

The ruby became an object-spirit. The discarded uniform gained consciousness over time — the centuries of accumulated service, the weight of the role the Bunyip held, the specific grief of an object left behind when the one who wore it chose to be free.

The Queen does not enter the Salt Pan. The Bunyip does not know she is there. But the Queen has watched what happened in the Salt Pan. She knows what these visitors have done. They have disturbed the Bunyip's domain. They have asked questions without categories. They have opened a door that should have stayed closed.

The Queen will deal with them in the next world.

---

## Doctrine

*Control is not freedom. To make everything around you organized and precise and filed is not to have healed the wound — it is to have built the wound into the foundation. The Salt Pan is not grief made landscape; it is fury made governance. The question that cannot be filed — where did he go? — is the one that opens the ground. The answer does not have to be good. It just has to be asked.*

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**The Celestial Bureaucracy (multiple chapters)**
The JTTW heavenly administration is not corrupt so much as completely process-bound: things are done in the correct order, filed in the correct record, processed through the correct channels. When Sun Wukong arrives demanding the position of Great Sage Equal to Heaven, the celestial officials give him a title that means "empty rank" — they found a category for him rather than denying him, because the bureaucracy prefers categorisation over conflict. Sun Wukong cannot be refused entry to heaven; he can only be given a role so minor it means nothing. The Salt Pan's Choir functions on identical logic: everything that enters must be filed. The crisis is not malice but completeness — the system's need to account for everything within its boundary.

**Chapters 75–77: Sun Wukong swallowed by the Blue-Haired Lion**
Sun Wukong is swallowed whole, sealed inside a warm dark space with no visible exit. He reconstitutes violently from inside — grows to full size, tears the demon apart. This is the structural source of Tekanter's rescue: compression → infiltration → kinetic disruption. In Trial 1 the capture is organizational rather than physical, and the rescue is the disruption of the filing system's completeness by an element it cannot categorize.

**Chapter 59–61: Princess Iron Fan and the uncontrollable force**
The Iron Fan controls a force that has become self-sustaining — Flame Mountain burns without ceasing. The Princess controls the fan but will not deploy it; her control over the force has become her identity. She cannot deploy the fan because using it would mean the force was over, and the force being over means she has nothing left to control. The Bunyip's Salt Pan is the same architecture: a force (the salt, the expansion, the Choir) that she controls because controlling it is the only thing that remains. Stopping would mean being in the stillness. She does not stop.

### Other Mythology

**Calypso (Homer, Odyssey, Books I and V)**
The nymph who keeps Odysseus on her island for seven years. She is genuinely kind. She makes the island into something to maintain, something to offer — perfect, enclosed, self-sufficient. Odysseus leaves. The island remains. The Bunyip's Salt Pan is Calypso's island after Odysseus has left: the thing she maintained is still there, still being maintained, still being extended and perfected. The one she maintained it for is gone. She maintains it anyway, because stopping is not in her system, and because stopping is stillness, and stillness is where the question lives.

**Circe (Homer, Odyssey)**
The sorceress who transforms sailors into animals, organized and kept — not for food, but for company, for management, for having something to do with her power. The Filed echo Circe's organized inhabitants: given exactly their category, not unhappy, unable to leave. The Bunyip has more precision and less warmth than Circe. The effect is structurally identical.

**Persephone's return (Greek)**
When Persephone is in the underworld, Demeter withholds spring. The world becomes cold and still. This is usually read as grief — Demeter mourning her daughter. But it is also fury, imposed order, the refusal to let anything grow because what she needed is not here. The Salt Pan is Demeter's winter with the grief removed: just the fury, just the stillness, just the organized refusal to allow anything to bloom in a space where the one she loved is not.

**The Royal Order of the Wattle**
Nine divine aspects of the Wattle's true spirit — beings of golden light, each with a guardian animal mount. The Wattle is the plant that protects Mirene and heals her body; the Royal Order are the spirit presences that the Wattle's consciousness throws off to guard and extend its reach through the Heart Worlds. The relationship is described the way people describe the spirit beings of Ayahuasca: not the plant itself but its protectors, its aspects, the intelligence behind the intelligence. The guardian animals bore the divine aspects through the Heart Worlds. The Bunyip and the Windmaster deserted together. This is the only desertion in the Order's history.

**The Object-Spirit (器物成精, Chinese mythology)**
Objects used for a long time, or objects containing concentrated feeling, gradually gain consciousness. Old brushes become scholars. Worn sandals become wanderers. Discarded ritual objects become spirits who continue the ritual. The ruby was the Bunyip's insignia — worn for centuries, containing the accumulated weight of her service to the Order. When she shed it, the object had enough concentrated history to continue on its own terms. The Red-Back Queen is the ruby's consciousness: the Bunyip's role-identity, discarded, become its own person. She is loyal to the Bunyip because she is the Bunyip's service-self — the part of her that was a guardian, that was dutiful, that took the Order seriously. The most devoted presence in the Bunyip's world. The Bunyip does not know she exists.
