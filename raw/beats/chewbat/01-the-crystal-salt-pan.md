## Arrival

The plain had once been something else. You could read it still — in the dry channels where water had run, in the white hexagonal plates of crust where the last pools had concentrated and gone, in the quality of the silence, which was not the silence of a place that had never held anything but the silence of a place that had been emptied and had not yet settled into itself.

The troupe came into it from the east, where the ground was still only dry. The sky above them was the same white as the ground below, and the horizon was the seam where they met without distinction.

The singing reached them before anything else — two hundred voices in formation so precise it had no seams, no individual breath audible, no accident of timbre or emphasis. It was a sound the body registered as something worth opening toward. Chewbat's chest did this, briefly, before some register below thought closed the opening again. The note had not changed. Had not varied by the smallest interval since they had arrived. There was no one breathing inside it.

Across the flat the crystal formations rose in low, angular clusters, too regular in their spacing to be natural, too specific in their shapes. The troupe moved through them toward the singing and the white that had no far edge.

---

## The Village

At the plain's edge the dwellings had been built into deep depressions in the ground, each one geometrically exact. The inhabitants moved within them with a careful deliberateness, as though following a law that had to be attended to at every step.

An elderly bilby named Mallee received the troupe. She had an immaculate home and warm broth and a story she told at the table while her eyes went to the white haze of the plain and came back.

The story: there had been a beautiful spirit, a water presence, and when the bilby choir sang to her she had brought abundance. Then a rebel bilby named Mulga had led away eighty percent of the village. The choir fell below its number. The spirit departed. The land dried. And now — she set down her bowl — creatures were being taken in the night.

There was water in the underground well, she said. She would provide it. But she needed the troupe's help. She needed the rebel leader removed and the village restored.

She looked at her hands on the table.

## Tekanter Goes to Find Mulga

Tekanter went. He crossed the mountains in long bounds and found the lair by tracking the sounds in it and announced himself to the guards in the way he usually announced himself.

The leader bilby, Mulga, came out.

Tekanter was prepared for something large. What he found was a bilby no bigger than a boot who met him force for force and showed no surprise at being matched. They fought to a standstill. Then, in the stillness between one blow and the next, Tekanter saw the tattoo on the bilby's neck: the mark of Discernment, the same mark he himself carries under his fur.

The mark has a meaning that is also a constraint. Those who hold it cannot produce a falsehood without losing their power. The mark cannot be counterfeited. Tekanter knew this.

He stopped fighting and listened.

What Mulga told him: there had been no rebellion. Eighty percent of the village had not gone anywhere of its own choosing. It had been taken — in the night, by shadows — and found later standing in circles on the plain, mouths open, in choir. Mulga's group had been pulling survivors out for months. The survivors came back damaged. Then the rescuers began to disappear.

Mulga had been watching him as he spoke, and Tekanter had been watching Mulga. He knew it was true. He had known from the first sentence.

*The village you came from,* Mulga said. *Describe it.*

Tekanter described it.

Mulga looked at him. *There is no village at the plain's edge,* he said. *There hasn't been for six months.*

Tekanter ran back the way he had come.

---

## The Mirage

There was no village. Goapus and Jeosmi lay on the dry riverbed where the borow had appeared to stand. The wall that had opened without breaking and closed again behind it had left no mark on the ground. What had been was not even an impression now.

Chewbat was gone.

Tekanter woke them. There were words spoken — sharply, and then more sharply — and the shapes of a fight, before he walked away from both of them and out onto the plain to find another way.

The outcast bilbies at the plain's edge, survivors from Mulga's camp, told him one thing of use: the entrances to the lairs were ringed with a circle of singing bilbies.

He walked the plain until he found the ring. He called out to the bilbies and they scattered. Beneath where they had stood, a fissure in the salt crust. Cold came up from it, steady and sourceless.

---

## The Garden

He stood at the fissure's edge long enough to see what the plain was.

At its centre, burned into the salt crust and extending outward to the horizon, a formation of five arms — each a trench of darker salt, black-edged, deliberate at a scale that required centuries rather than hands. The five arms divided the plain into five sections. In each section, arranged in concentric arcs, in radial lines, in spirals so precise they could have been drawn: the bodies.

They were not dead. Each one stood in its position with its face lifted to the sky and its mouth open, the Choir's note moving through it. They had been brought here over a long period of time, one by one, and placed. The salt had been working into them from the outside, crystallising the surface first and then advancing inward. The oldest of them had lost their edges to it; they were formations now, indistinguishable from the plain that held them. The newer ones still had features. At the centre of each section, embedded in the crust: a cluster of small glass jars, sealed, filled with something icy blue.

Tekanter looked at it long enough to understand the geometry, then went in.

---

## The Descent

He fought all the way down — wall to wall in the narrow passage, the iron-tipped tail clearing whatever came at him from the dark, his gold eyes on every movement before it resolved. The Salt-Architects who came at him in the descent found themselves working against a body that had spent a very long time learning how bodies could be used in constrained spaces.

Then the black energy came. It did not come from a direction. It arrived from everywhere at once, a thick current of it, and the crystal formed at his wrists and ankles before he had completed his next step. He continued to fight from inside the chains. He fought until the inventory of what there was to fight ran out. Then he was still.

Goapus and Jeosmi had followed at a distance. They saw the black energy take him, and they did not go in. One of them had seen enough of what it could do. They turned back and found Mulga.

---

## What the Rescued Bilby Said

She was at Mulga's camp, one of the survivors, sitting in the careful way of someone who has come back from somewhere and not come back entirely.

She described the glass coffin. The salt in the air above her, falling slowly. The voice — low, working — reciting the names of each thing she remembered, one by one. Not her name. The names of the reaching in her: the places in her that were still turned toward what was absent, the things she was still waiting for. Each name arrived in her like a hook and drew the named thing to the surface where the salt could reach it. The named thing stopped moving.

By the third day, her memories had begun to organise themselves without prompting. Coming forward in order, presenting themselves.

By the fifth day, she had no understanding of why she had resisted.

By the seventh day, there was nothing left in her that wanted anything.

Her body had remained. It stood. It sang. It performed the note that the plain required. The part of her that had direction, that leaned forward into the world — that part was in a jar on a shelf in the dark below the salt.

She could not describe the moment of its leaving. She had been relieved, with precision, of the capacity to form words for it.

---

## The Ruse

Goapus transformed into a bilby. Not an approximation — a true becoming, cellular, complete, down to the specific hollowed rhythm of a creature that had been on the plain's edge long enough to begin its dissolution. Jeosmi rendered himself absent from visibility without being absent from the space, and walked in the shadow of Goapus's new shape.

The search-parties were looking for correct geometry. Goapus was correct geometry now. They carried him down through the fissure. Jeosmi followed in the space between their steps.

---

## The Cave

Below the plain the cave opened, low-ceilinged and vast, and the blue was everywhere — shelf after shelf of glass jars from floor to ceiling in every direction, the light coming from what was inside them, cold and sourceless, the colour of something that has been alive and is no longer moving. The shelves receded into dark in every direction. At the far wall, a row of glass coffins, each one fitted with a narrow tube that ran to a jar mounted above it. The jars were filling.

Chewbat was in the third coffin. The salt moved correctly in the air above him. The recitation had been performed correctly. The salt was not adhering.

The Bunyip stood at the coffin with her hands moving through the patterns of her craft and her voice working, low and unbroken — naming each thing she could read in him, each tender place, each reach — and finding that each thing she named moved before the salt could take it. Moved back into its own motion, pulled there by something she could not name, because what pulled it had no tender place itself. Was not reaching toward anything. Simply was, completely, in the way that does not give the salt purchase.

She had been at this for three days. Her voice had not rested.

Tekanter was against the wall in his crystal chains. He watched the Bunyip work. He watched the salt fail to adhere. He said nothing.

At the centre of the cave floor, alone on the bare salt, sat a single jar: the same shape as all the others, but holding dirty brown water, silted at the bottom, no blue in it. It was the only dark point in the cave.

---

## The Chains

Jeosmi moved to Tekanter, invisible. The crystal chains had been named into existence from the full record of Tekanter's violence — every blow catalogued, every direction of force accounted for. Every angle filed.

Jeosmi untied them from the back.

They waited. The Bunyip worked at the coffin. The salt fell and did not adhere.

Then Goapus, on the cave floor in his bilby form, changed.

Not into one thing. Into a sequence of things — bilby, then platypus, then bare stone, then thornbush, then bilby again — and the naming system that moved through the cave ran each category, found each one superseded, ran the next. The sound it produced was not screaming but it had something of screaming's quality, a note that required a chest that did not exist to hold it correctly.

The Bunyip turned from the coffin.

Jeosmi released fire. The coffin opened. Chewbat stood up. Three days of precise and exhaustive work had found no seam in him, and the salt had nothing to show for it.

Tekanter looked at what Jeosmi had done with the chains and took himself up through their geometry in one straight leap, at an angle that had not been filed, and the crystal held him for one second and then shattered. He came down beside the coffin.

---

## The Chase

They ran up through the fissure and out onto the flat of the plain.

The Bunyip came behind them, and at the top she shed the working shape she had worn in the cave and showed what she was: large, old, furious with the specific quality of fury that belongs to a system that has just been broken from the outside. She breathed magic and bonds. The circle of bilbies that had appeared to stand at the fissure's edge holding water jars dissolved — the shapes that had been holding the illusion open released it and ran. The four of them fought her in the open salt.

They were close to having her.

She dissolved into thick black energy and went back down the hole.

---

## What Tekanter Remembered

He had spent years, early in his life, as a servant in the company of the nine divine wattle celestials. The black energy she had dissolved into — he had seen it before, on a different creature, in a different colour. It was a binding. The specific cord by which a guardian animal is tethered to its owner. The cord had a signature. He was looking at it.

He looked at the place on the plain's surface where the fissure was.

Then he thought about the notch in the bunyip's ear. He had seen that notch before, on a rabbit, on the rabbit that belonged to one of the nine.

He sent a message.

---

## The Lullaby

The Bunny Celestial came to the fissure alone. She was small. The warmth around her was the warmth of a thing that does not need to announce its nature.

She stood at the opening in the salt and sang.

It was a lullaby — not a command, not a binding, not a working of any kind. A lullaby of the sort that is sung to something small, to call it back to what it is.

The song went down into the fissure.

After a time the growling came up first. Then the bunyip came up, enormous and hideous and unable not to come, and she saw the Bunny Celestial, and the transformation began in her without her consent. It moved through her body from the inside, and she fought it, and the fighting produced sounds that were not hers — or were hers, but from places in her that had not been opened in a very long time — voices of pain that the work had sealed over, sounds that belonged to the years of it, the anger and the effort and the maintenance of all that careful not-looking. They came out in a stream and then they stopped.

What remained was a small dark rabbit, sitting on the salt, looking up.

The Bunny Celestial said nothing for a moment. Then, quietly: *Oh. There you are.*

She sang the lullaby a second time, just for her.

---

## After

The Celestial told the troupe what she knew. One of her own kind's guardian mounts had run — had run with another, and the other had not stayed, and what was left behind had turned in the direction of the only work available to it. She thanked the troupe without ceremony. She was already looking at the rabbit.

Then she turned to Chewbat and gave him the coordinates for the next world. Not to Tekanter, who had fought. To Chewbat, who had simply been in the coffin for three days and given the salt nothing to take.

---

## Doctrine

*The craft requires a seam — the place in a creature where what it is and what it reaches for do not meet. Name the reach. The salt knows where to go. The creature is filed and the body continues and what was left does its work.*

*What cannot be filed is a creature that has no gap between its being and its doing, that reaches for nothing because nothing in it is turned away. The salt lands and finds no hold and falls as ordinary salt.*

*The jar of dirty river water at the centre of the cave had been sitting there for three centuries. It was the only jar in the cave the Bunyip had not processed. It held the last water from the river she had abandoned. She had been unable to name it because naming it would have required naming the thing beneath the work — the question the work had been built to not ask. When the lullaby came down the hole, the question did not need to be answered. It only needed to be present. That was enough.*

### David Malouf — Voice Notes

**The landscape that carries memory**
Malouf's landscapes are never neutral. They hold what has happened in them — in the quality of the silence, in the shapes of what was once there, in the temperature and weight of the air. The Salt Pan is described as a place of aftermath: emptied, not empty. Its whiteness is not absence but a particular kind of presence, the presence of what has been taken from it.

**The body that knows first**
Malouf locates understanding in the body before the mind catches up. Chewbat's chest opening toward the harmony and then something underneath closing it again — this is rendered as physical before it is understood as significant. The body's response is the narrative's instrument.

**The object that holds history**
The jar of dirty river water at the cave's centre. Malouf is precise about objects that carry the weight of what their owner cannot carry consciously. The jar is described once, given its specifics — the silted water, the dark, the absence of blue light — and allowed to hold what it holds without explanation.

**The gap in language rendered as presence**
The survivor who cannot describe the moment the spirit left — who has been relieved of the capacity to form words for it — is rendered in Malouf's register: not as a dramatic revelation but as a simple statement of what is absent and why. The horror lies in the precision of the deprivation.

**No foreshadowing**
Events occur without announcement. The singing is heard; the body responds; the note is identified as unchanged. There is no signal that any of this will be significant. The village is visited; the broth is accepted; what happens next happens. Malouf's narration does not prepare the reader for what comes. It only describes, precisely, what is.

### 聊齋志異 (*Liáo Zhāi Zhì Yì*) — Thematic Parallels

**執念成魔 (*Zhí niàn chéng mó*) — The work that becomes the monster**
In the 聊齋 tradition the supernatural creature has a history — a choice made, a course followed, a long accumulation. The Bunyip is not a demon by nature but by duration. The work she sustained for three centuries was not evil in its origins. It was what was available. The shape it took over time was determined by what it was organised around: the not-asking.

**魂魄 (*Hún Pò*) — The dual soul**
The craft targets the 魂 — the aspect of the creature that leans forward into the world, that wants, that has direction. The 魄 that remains is functional. It stands. It sings. It follows the last instruction it was given. What the Bunyip's processed creatures lack is not life but the part of life that moves toward things. The jars contain that part, icy blue, still faintly moving when directly observed.

**The binding cord**
The black energy is a 縛靈索 — a guardian's tether, the cord by which a divine mount is held in relation to its celestial. It has a signature. Tekanter recognises it from his years in the company of the nine. The cord had not been cut; it had been carried away, a binding without its other end. When the Bunny Celestial came, the cord found what it had always been oriented toward.

### Journey to the West

**The chains that filed everything but up (Chapters 75–77)**
Sun Wukong inside the demon's stomach, reconstituting by doing what the containment had not accounted for. Tekanter's crystal chains are a record — complete, accurate — of every direction he has ever fought. They account for everything his violence has been. They do not account for a kangaroo who decides that the only remaining direction is vertical. The system's completeness is also its limit.

**Princess Iron Fan (Chapters 59–61)**
The force maintained not because it serves a purpose but because maintaining it is the only way to avoid the stillness in which the question lives. The Iron Fan controls Flame Mountain and cannot put it out, because putting it out would leave her with nothing to control. The Bunyip's garden operates on the same logic. The work is not the point. The work is what stands between her and what she has not said.
