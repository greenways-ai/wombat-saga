## Village

**The Gilded Caves.** A vast, dark network of limestone caverns beneath the roots of the world. The air is cool and smells of damp earth and a strange, metallic sweetness.

**The Echidna Guard.** A weaver community of Echidnas who serve as the architects and maintainers of the great Web. They move with a clicking, deliberate pace, their quills shimmering in the low, golden light of the threads. They do not view the Web as a prison, but as a banquet-hall.

**The Villager:** An elder Echidna whose snout is stained with the residues of a thousand meals. He explains that the Web is the only thing standing between them and the "Great Thirst." The golden threads hum with a frequency that draws the *Sifted Souls*—the tiny, ant-like fragments of spirit that leak from the Salt Pan above. Without the Web to catch them, the Echidnas would starve in the darkness.

## Monster

**The Red-Back Queen.** She does not hide behind a facade of loneliness. She is an object of singular, concentrated purpose: **Revenge.** 

She is the Bunyip's ruby: the insignia of the Royal Order of the Wattle that the Bunyip wore when she was a guardian mount. When the Bunyip ran away with the Windmaster, she shed the ruby at the edge of the waterway.

The ruby became an object-spirit—centuries of concentrated service given independent form. She followed the troupe from the Salt Pan because she witnessed the destruction of her mistress's world. To her, the troupe are not travellers; they are the desecrators of the Bunyip's scoured sanctity. She wants them scoured in turn. She wants the debt of the Salt Pan paid in their threads.

The Echidnas are her willing subjects. In exchange for the "harvest" of the Sifted Souls (the ants), they give the Queen their labor, their quills, and their absolute devotion. They are the ones who spin the golden doubt that binds the unthreaded.

**Underlings:**
- *The Docents* — enthusiastic explainers of the Web's beauty; their job is to make captivity sound like belonging.
- *The Whispering Swarms* — ants (Sifted Souls) that crawl through the crevices of the cavern, carrying the Queen's vengeful whispers to the ears of the unwary.
- *The Weavers* — Echidna artisans who spin the golden doubt, identifying and targeting the unthreaded.
- *The Bound* — cocooned in golden thread, not unhappy, their souls slowly replaced by the scoured logic of the Queen's vengeance.

## Distraction

A wallaby family is offered debt-relief (their Tally-Debt cleared) in exchange for approaching Tekanter with a fabricated mob-distress story requiring a kangaroo's perimeter skills. The story is convincing. He goes east.

---

## Capture

The Weavers identify Chewbat as unthreaded — no visible duty-thread, no shadow of obligation, which makes him an anomaly that the Web's logic cannot grasp. He is pure and unadulterated, a living vacancy that the Web seeks to fill. 

While Goapus slips into the groundwater, the Weavers come through a window with a thread of golden doubt.

## Rescue

Jeosmi converts Tekanter to a pulse of heat — not destroys him, transmutes him to pure kinetic fire, a controlled transformation that Tekanter's fire makes possible. He travels through the thread-network as a pulse, reconstitutes at full mass at the throne-room junction-node. The explosion when he reconstitutes shatters the central Web.

## Infiltration and Discord

As the troupe enters the dark heart of the cavern, the Queen begins her psychological assault. She does not use force; she uses the **Beautiful Mirage**. She weaves a fantasy so attractive it feels like the resolution of every journey.

To Chewbat, she shows a world where song requires no protection—a stillness so absolute that the very idea of a "protector" like Tekanter feels like a coarse and violent intrusion. To Tekanter, she shows a world where he is no longer an "ancillary" to a silent boy, but a hero of his own kinetic legend, free from the burden of the unthreaded.

The **Sifted Whispers** (the ants) carry these images into their ears. The friction is immediate and abrasive. Chewbat, usually the silent center, turns on Tekanter, his voice a cold thrum of judgment against Tekanter's "purposeless fire."

"You are the weight," Chewbat murmurs, the Queen's golden doubt coloring his words. "You are the thing that keeps the song from being clear."

Tekanter, stunned and feeling the sharp edge of centuries of unthanked service, explodes in a fury of sparks. "Then sing in the dark alone," he snarls. He storms off into the labyrinthine shadows of the limestone caves, leaving the Singer and the weight-bearer behind.

## The King’s Lament

In the deep silence of the lower caverns, Tekanter's fire dims to a smolder. The Queen's whispers find him here, unthreaded and raw. She does not mock him; she offers him a mirror of what he was.

We see the truth of his history: Tekanter was not always a wandering protector. He was the **King of the Kangaroos**, a sovereign of the high plains whose kinetics were so absolute he could shift his very likeness at will. He had everything—the loyalty of the mob, the fire of the sun, and the promise of a bride more beautiful than the first bloom of the wattle.

But a tragedy occurred. A moment of kinetic pride or a failure of the royal thrum caused his fall. He was scoured from the mob, his kingdom lost, and his bride taken by the wind. He became a shapeshifter without a shape, a king without a kingdom, binding himself to the unthreaded Singer as a form of penance.

The Queen appears to him not as a monster, but as a docent of restoration. "I can weave it back," she whispers, her golden threads shimmering with the likeness of his lost mob. "I can give you the kingdom, the form, and the bride who was promised. You need only accept the obligation of the Web. You need only leave the Singer to his own silence."

The Web shimmers with satisfaction. The troupe’s unity is broken.

**The Queen's wound — revealed:** When the Web collapses, the Queen does not weep. Her fury only burns brighter. She does not care about connection or obligation. She cares about the **Debt.**

*You broke her world. You scoured her stillness. Now, I will scour you.*

*You had no right to ask her where he went.*

Chewbat: *She had no right to not know.*

The Queen cannot answer this. She is the Bunyip's service-self — the part of the Bunyip that knew what duty was, that took the role seriously. The Queen understands obligation. She does not understand the Bunyip's abandonment of her post any better than Chewbat does. She is loyal to the Bunyip anyway, because loyalty is what she is made of.

She lets the Web dissolve. She follows them to the next world.

## Doctrine

*Obligation becomes entrapment when it is imposed rather than chosen. The Web is beautiful because imposed obligation is often made beautiful — it has to be, or no one would accept it. Find the real thread: the actual attachment, the genuine responsibility, the obligation that was chosen and would be chosen again. The real thread does not need golden architecture to hold.*

*Note on the Queen: the most loyal thing in any world is sometimes the role someone left behind. It continues to believe in the function even after the one who held it walked away. This is not wisdom. It is not folly. It is what loyalty is before it becomes something else.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**Chapters 72–73: The Seven Spider Women (蜘蛛精) — the structural source**
Seven spider demonesses in Pansī Cave spin golden silk webs that ensnare Xuanzang and Zhu Bajie. The webs are beautiful. The demons run a "bathhouse" as cover — inviting travellers to wash, then cocooning them. The Red-Back Queen's Docents (explaining the Web's beauty, making captivity sound like belonging) are drawn directly from the spiders' hospitable-predator operation. The golden thread as beautiful obligation: the silk looks like treasure. The trap is the beauty itself.

**Chapter 73: The Hundred-Eye Demon (百眼魔君)**
The centipede demon who protects the Spider Women — the monster behind the monster. His hundred eyes produce light that specifically blinds Sun Wukong. The Queen's Weavers operate similarly: the visible threat is the web, but the real mechanism is the identification of the specific wound (Pellah) that binds better than any thread.

**The Golden Headband (金箍兒)**
Given to Sun Wukong by Guanyin — a restraint that works through the mind rather than the body, causing pain when a specific sutra is recited. The web-binding functions similarly: it seeks an internal hook to latch onto. Because Chewbat is pure, the Web finds nothing to grip. His freedom from internal binding (wounds/secrets) is what makes the external binding (the Web) fail once the silence is broken.

### Other Mythology

**Arachne (Greek/Ovid)**
The mortal weaver who challenged Athena to a weaving contest. Her tapestry was technically flawless. Athena destroyed it and turned Arachne into a spider. The Red-Back Queen's web is also technically perfect — the problem is not craft but the way craft became instrument. The Queen weaves not because she loves weaving but because the Web is her best tool for this specific purpose.

**Indra's Net (Hindu/Buddhist)**
An infinite net with a jewel at each vertex, each jewel reflecting all the others — a metaphor for interdependence and mutual connection. The Gilded Web is the corrupted version: a net in which every thread of connection is a thread of control, not of mutual reflection. Real obligation is Indra's Net (each node freely connected to all others); false obligation is the Gilded Web (connection as possession).

**The Object-Spirit (器物成精, Chinese mythology)**
The Red-Back Queen is the Bunyip's discarded ruby-insignia become conscious — centuries of accumulated service given independent form. In Chinese folk tradition: objects that have served one person faithfully for long enough retain a kind of loyalty after separation. The Queen's fury at the troupe is the loyalty-spirit's response to its object being disturbed. She cannot help it. She is made of the Bunyip's duty-self. She will follow them through every world if she needs to.

**The Fates (Greek: Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos)**
Three figures who spin, measure, and cut the thread of every human life. The Weavers are a distortion: they spin threads of obligation that should not exist, add threads that connect the unwilling, measure the wrong things. The Fates' threads are fated; the Queen's threads are imposed. The difference is the difference between fate and captivity.
