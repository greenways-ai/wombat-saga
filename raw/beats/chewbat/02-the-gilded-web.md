# Trial 2: The Red-Back Queen of the Gilded Web

**World:** The Gilded Web — the World of Beautiful Obligation

## Village

**Threadsong.** A weaver community whose young people leave at a specific age and don't come back — or come back changed, or simply don't come back. The village is quieter every generation.

**Villager:** An echidna whose son left five years ago rather than accept an assigned obligation-thread. He chose freedom over the community's expectation and hasn't written. She doesn't know if leaving was right or wrong, and the not-knowing is the thing that lives in her.

## Monster

**The Red-Back Queen.** She is not what she seems. She presents as a lonely creature who built the Web from need — something that started with one genuine thread of connection and could not stop adding. The Web is beautiful. The story she tells about herself is sad and sympathetic.

This is not the full truth.

The Red-Back Queen is the Bunyip's ruby: the insignia of the Royal Order of the Wattle that the Bunyip wore when she was a guardian mount. When the Bunyip ran away with the Windmaster, she shed the ruby at the edge of the waterway. She left it behind.

The ruby became an object-spirit — centuries of concentrated service, the weight of the guardian role, the specific grief of an object abandoned when the one who wore it chose freedom. The Queen gained consciousness over time, and with it: loyalty to the Bunyip, fury at those who disturb the Bunyip's domain, and the memory of what it meant to be a guardian's insignia.

She followed the troupe from the Salt Pan. She watched what they did there — the questions they asked, the door they opened, the divine descent they triggered. She has come to the next world ahead of them.

The Web is her instrument. She did not build it because she was lonely. She built it because she needs to contain the ones who disturbed the Bunyip's perfectly organized grief.

**Underlings:**
- *The Docents* — enthusiastic explainers of the Web's purpose and beauty; their job is to make captivity sound like belonging
- *The Weavers* — add new threads, identify and target the unthreaded; they can sense which wound to pull on
- *The Bound* — cocooned in golden thread, not unhappy, entirely without choice

## Distraction

A wallaby family is offered debt-relief (their Tally-Debt cleared) in exchange for approaching Tekanter with a fabricated mob-distress story requiring a kangaroo's perimeter skills. The story is convincing. He goes east.

---

## Capture

The Weavers identify Chewbat as unthreaded — no visible obligation-thread, which makes him anomalous and dangerous to the Web's logic. They also find his specific wound: his teacher **Pellah**, taken by the Censorate, a name Chewbat has never said aloud since it happened.

While Goapus slips into the groundwater, the Weavers come through a window with Pellah's name in the thread.

---

## Rescue

Jeosmi converts Tekanter to a frequency signal — not destroys him, transmutes him to pure kinetic frequency, a controlled transformation that Tekanter's fire makes possible. He travels through the thread-network as a signal, reconstitutes at full mass at the throne-room junction-node. The explosion when he reconstitutes shatters the central Web infrastructure.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

Inside the Web, surrounded by golden obligation, Chewbat says **Pellah's name out loud** for the first time since the Censorate took him. The Queen hears it and understands: that is a real thread — one Chewbat has been carrying without naming. Not fake obligation. Something actual.

When Tekanter returns and hears the name in passing, he registers it and keeps walking. This is exactly right. The name doesn't need a response. It needed to be said.

**The Queen's wound — revealed:** When the Web collapses, the Queen drops the lonely-creature story. She is not lonely. She is loyal and furious. She built the Web to hold the troupe, to give the Bunyip time to reorder her domain, to punish the ones who asked the question that broke the Salt Pan's stillness.

*You had no right to ask her where he went.*

Chewbat: *She had no right to not know.*

The Queen cannot answer this. She is the Bunyip's service-self — the part of the Bunyip that knew what duty was, that took the role seriously. The Queen understands obligation. She does not understand the Bunyip's abandonment of her post any better than Chewbat does. She is loyal to the Bunyip anyway, because loyalty is what she is made of.

She lets the Web dissolve. She follows them to the next world.

## Doctrine

*Obligation becomes entrapment when it is imposed rather than chosen. The Web is beautiful because imposed obligation is often made beautiful — it has to be, or no one would accept it. Find the real thread: the actual attachment, the genuine responsibility, the obligation that was chosen and would be chosen again. The real thread does not need golden architecture to hold.*

*Note on the Queen: the most loyal thing in any world is sometimes the role someone left behind. It continues to believe in the function even after the one who held it walked away. This is not wisdom. It is not folly. It is what loyalty is before it becomes something else.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**Chapters 72–73: The Seven Spider Women (蜘蛛精) — the structural source**
Seven spider demonesses in Pansī Cave spin golden silk webs that ensnare Xuanzang and Zhu Bajie. The webs are beautiful. The demons run a "bathhouse" as cover — inviting travellers to wash, then cocooning them. The Red-Back Queen's Docents (explaining the Web's beauty, making captivity sound like belonging) are drawn directly from the spiders' hospitable-predator operation. The golden thread as beautiful obligation: the silk looks like treasure. The trap is the beauty itself.

**Chapter 73: The Hundred-Eye Demon (百眼魔君)**
The centipede demon who protects the Spider Women — the monster behind the monster. His hundred eyes produce light that specifically blinds Sun Wukong. The Queen's Weavers operate similarly: the visible threat is the web, but the real mechanism is the identification of the specific wound (Pellah) that binds better than any thread.

**The Golden Headband (金箍兒)**
Given to Sun Wukong by Guanyin — a restraint that works through the mind rather than the body, causing pain when a specific sutra is recited. The web-binding via named wound (Pellah) is the same mechanism: the thread doesn't restrain physically, it binds through something real that the prisoner genuinely carries. The wound is the headband. Chewbat put it on himself by caring about Pellah. The Queen only uses what is already there.

### Other Mythology

**Arachne (Greek/Ovid)**
The mortal weaver who challenged Athena to a weaving contest. Her tapestry was technically flawless. Athena destroyed it and turned Arachne into a spider. The Red-Back Queen's web is also technically perfect — the problem is not craft but the way craft became instrument. The Queen weaves not because she loves weaving but because the Web is her best tool for this specific purpose.

**Indra's Net (Hindu/Buddhist)**
An infinite net with a jewel at each vertex, each jewel reflecting all the others — a metaphor for interdependence and mutual connection. The Gilded Web is the corrupted version: a net in which every thread of connection is a thread of control, not of mutual reflection. Real obligation is Indra's Net (each node freely connected to all others); false obligation is the Gilded Web (connection as possession).

**The Object-Spirit (器物成精, Chinese mythology)**
The Red-Back Queen is the Bunyip's discarded ruby-insignia become conscious — centuries of accumulated service given independent form. In Chinese folk tradition: objects that have served one person faithfully for long enough retain a kind of loyalty after separation. The Queen's fury at the troupe is the loyalty-spirit's response to its object being disturbed. She cannot help it. She is made of the Bunyip's duty-self. She will follow them through every world if she needs to.

**The Fates (Greek: Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos)**
Three figures who spin, measure, and cut the thread of every human life. The Weavers are a distortion: they spin threads of obligation that should not exist, add threads that connect the unwilling, measure the wrong things. The Fates' threads are fated; the Queen's threads are imposed. The difference is the difference between fate and captivity.
