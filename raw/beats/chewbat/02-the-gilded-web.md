## Arrival

The second Heart-World has no night.

The star that should sit at the sky's centre has been enclosed — drawn down into the cavern system and distributed through the walls, so that every surface of the vast limestone network glows with a warm, sourceless gold. There is no shadow anywhere. The light comes from every direction equally and cancels itself, so that objects appear to float slightly, unanchored from their own depth.

The troupe descends through a fissure in the upper rock and emerges into abundance. The cavern floor is rich — deep moss, fungal blooms in clusters of amber and cream, roots hanging from the ceiling that drip clean water. Everything that a creature could need is here and has always been here and shows no sign of running out.

The eerie quality is not scarcity. It is the opposite. Everything is too available. The air smells of sweetness with something metallic underneath, the way honey smells if the hive has been open too long.

Then the singing reached them.

Not a note — a song, full and shifting, the kind that changes before you have finished hearing what it was a moment ago. Hauntingly beautiful in the specific way of things that are almost but not quite recognisable: you could follow a phrase of it and feel that you understood it, and then it would fold into something else, something adjacent, and the understanding would not quite carry. The lyrics — if they were lyrics — were in no language any of them had encountered. They might have been a language. They might have been something with the structure of language without the content, the way a dream has the structure of a narrative without the continuity. The song did not repeat. It built on itself, each phrase a variation of the one before, opening outward the way a fractal opens — always more of the same pattern, never arriving at an edge.

Chewbat turned toward it without deciding to. His chest opened, briefly, toward the sound — the specific, involuntary opening that a harmony of that quality produces in a singer's body, the way light produces a reflex in the eye. Then the part of him that was not his chest closed the opening again, quietly.

"Don't follow it," Jeosmi said.

"I wasn't going to," Chewbat said.

"You were considering it."

"I was considering not considering it."

Tekanter had moved to the edge of one of the dry channels, his gold eyes tracking the horizon. "There's smoke east. Real smoke, not salt haze. Which means something is burning something, which means there's a village." He looked back at them. "Also I am deeply thirsty. Can we."

They went east.

The singing did not get quieter as they moved away from it. It stayed at the same distance — not louder, not softer, always just at the edge of what could be made out. Not following them. Simply remaining present, the way a smell remains in a room after the source of it is gone.

"It's warm," Goapus says.

"It's always warm," Jeosmi says. He is looking at the walls. Not at what is on them — at the walls themselves, at the faint pulse of gold in the limestone. "The light doesn't come from outside. It comes from inside the stone."

"What's inside the stone?" Chewbat asks.

No one answers. They move toward the sound of voices.

## The Echidnas

The village is deep in the middle cavern — buildings of packed earth and golden filament, tidy and warm, the inhabitants moving with the unhurried ease of creatures who have never had to worry about what comes next.

The echidnas are genuinely happy. This is the first thing to understand about this world: the happiness is not performed, not coerced. They have been here for generations and the cavern has never failed them and they love it completely. When they speak about the Web and its Queen, it is with the matter-of-fact gratitude of someone describing weather that has only ever been good.

An elder echidna explains: the Queen maintains the Web. The Web holds the light in the stone, keeps the water flowing, keeps the moss growing. Without her, within a generation, the cavern would go dark and cold and everything in it would die. They know this. Their grandparents were told this. Their grandparents' grandparents negotiated the original contract.

The contract: the Queen requires a sacrifice, given willingly, at intervals. One echidna, chosen by lot, given to the Web. In exchange: the light, the water, the warmth, the abundance.

"Chosen by lot," Tekanter says.

"Yes," the elder says, with no more weight on the words than if he were describing a rota for collecting water.

"And when it's your turn?"

The elder looks at him with mild surprise, the way you look at someone who has asked whether the sun is bright. "Then it is my turn," he says. "The Web sustains us all. We sustain the Web. That is what a contract is."

Chewbat is watching the elder's face. He has been watching it since the man began speaking. The happiness is real. The acceptance is real. Neither of these things makes the contract less terrible.

---

## The Chamber

The Queen's chamber is deeper in. The echidnas lead them there — eager, hospitable, proud of their world. The chamber is vast, its ceiling lost in gold-threaded dark. The Queen herself is not visible at first: only the Web, which covers every surface from floor to lost-ceiling, threads of gold so fine they are almost invisible individually but collectively produce a dense, warm shimmer that seems to breathe.

The attendants are there. They move in the Queen's periphery, small and quick, and they whisper to her — the troupe can hear it, faintly, not the words but the quality of the whispering: the specific excited register of something that has identified an opportunity.

The Queen descends.

She is large. She is precise. She has the specific quality of a thing that has been in absolute control of its environment for so long that it no longer needs to demonstrate control — it simply is the environment. Her eyes — eight of them, arranged with a geometry that is almost beautiful — take in the troupe without appearing to move.

She welcomes them. She means it, in the way that a fisherman means it when fish swim into the net. The welcome is genuine. The intention underneath it is also genuine. These two things coexist in her without contradiction.

The echidna attendants press close and murmur: *the singer. Unthreaded. If they can bring him to the Web—*

The Queen's eight eyes settle on Chewbat. She is still. The Web breathes around her.

---

## The Road and the Young Echidna

The Queen sends them back through the echidna village to rest before the formal welcome — there will be a feast, she says, a ceremony. The echidnas are delighted. They chatter around the troupe as they walk back through the warm golden passages.

A young echidna — barely grown, its quills still soft — steps into the path.

Tekanter stops. His fire, which has been banked low since they entered the warm world, flares once, brief and controlled. He has felt something wrong since they descended into the cavern and has not been able to locate it precisely. Now he has located it.

He does what he does.

It is very fast.

The young echidna — which was not a young echidna, which was something wearing a young echidna, which was one of the Queen's arrangements — does not get up.

The passage goes quiet. The other echidnas press back.

Chewbat looks at what is on the ground. He looks at Tekanter.

"That was a child," he says.

"It wasn't," Tekanter says.

"It looked like a child."

"Looking like a child and being a child are not the same thing. I know the difference."

"How," Chewbat says. "How did you know the difference."

Tekanter cannot answer this in a way that will satisfy. He knew because he knew, the way he knows all the things he knows, which is through a capacity he has never been able to explain to someone who doesn't have it. He knew and he acted and what's on the ground is what's on the ground.

The fight is quick and sharp and neither of them says what the fight is really about. Tekanter storms off into the side passages. Chewbat watches him go. Goapus and Jeosmi stand very still on either side of the corpse of the thing that had been wearing the shape of a young echidna, saying nothing.

The golden light breathes.

---

## Tekanter's Cavern

He walks until the passage opens into a chamber where the walls are covered in bioluminescent fungus — deep purple, soft blue, a dim shifting glow that is the first thing in this world that isn't gold. The air tastes different here. Slightly sweet in the back of the throat in a way that makes the edges of things uncertain.

He sits down. His fire goes low. The argument with Chewbat sits in him the way arguments do when you were right and know you were right and it doesn't help.

The chamber reshapes itself. Not suddenly — the way the light shifts when a cloud passes over it, so gradual you don't notice until it has already happened. The limestone becomes the red-clay walls of the high plains country he grew up in. The fungal glow becomes afternoon light, the specific angle of it in late summer, the way it fell across the warrens.

He knows it is not real. He stays anyway.

She appears in the next chamber — a glimpse of her, moving between the entrance and the far wall. Taller than he remembered. The same gait, the specific unhurried rhythm of a creature who has never needed to hurry because she was always where she needed to be.

He calls her name.

The sound of his own voice using that name, in this light, after this long, does something to his chest that he would prefer not to describe.

She moves away — not fleeing, just moving, the way she always moved, always somewhere he was just a step behind.

He follows.

The warren beyond is full. Small forms moving in the entrance-light, the specific size and colour of him at a young age, a dozen of them, the sounds of a mob at rest. One of them looks up at him with his own gold eyes.

He stands in the entrance for a long time.

He had the oath. He had the truth to carry. The oath required him to carry it and he did and the mob scattered and she went with them because there was nothing left to go back to and he has been walking ever since. He understood this at the time. He understands it now. The understanding has never become easier.

The illusion is very good. The small forms move with the specific weight of real bodies.

He is still there when the Web finds the thread it has been looking for and begins to pull.

---

## Goapus's Water

A different passage. A different kind of wrong.

The fungal light shifts and the walls become wet, and then the floor, and Goapus is in the river before he registers the transition — the deep cold of it, the specific current, the exact pressure of the water against the bill that he has not felt since the drying. The river of his birth, the one that ran through the country his community held for eleven generations.

The river is full. Not restored — *full*, brimming with a vitality it had even in the best years, the water clear over the old rocks and moving fast and carrying the particular smell of deep running water in country that loves it. It is the river before the drying, before the first season the rains did not come, before the second season and the third.

And they are there.

The community. Not the ghosts of them — the actual people, going about the actual business of a community in good water: two elders arguing on the far bank, the children doing what children do in a river that belongs to them, voices carrying across the current the way they carry when no one is worried about anything.

The river did not take them. The river dried and they left — dispersed slowly, one family and then another, going to where the water still was. Not dying. Simply going. And being gone is different from being dead but it is not easier, and he has been carrying the difference for a long time.

He shapes himself into other things because his own shape is the shape of a platypus in that river, in that community, in that country — and that combination does not exist anywhere except in him. He wears other forms the way a house wears paint after the original wood is gone. He is good at it. It has a cost.

They are all there. The river is full.

The Web is very patient, and it has found exactly the right thread.

---

## Jeosmi's Room

The Web offers him the smallest thing it has.

A house. A morning. Someone in the next room making ordinary sounds — not the sounds of a creature managing itself carefully around him, but the sounds of someone going about their morning without any part of their attention on whether he is safe.

The girl from next door. The one he grew up beside — not afraid of him, never afraid, which was unusual enough that he had registered it immediately, a child who understood what he was and did not reorganise herself around the knowledge. She asked him questions. Not frightened questions. Curious ones.

He had the chance to stay.

He knew, at the time, what staying would have looked like. He has had a long time and enough distance to finish the thought with some precision: the ordinary mornings, the particular texture of a place you belong to, someone beside you at the table who knows everything about you and has not left. Nothing required of him beyond being present in it. He would have been happier. He knows this. He has known it for a long time without quite letting himself close the sentence.

The Web shows him the morning. The sounds from the next room. The table set for two.

He sits down to it.

The light is right. The sounds are exactly right. He does not notice, quite yet, the fine thread running from his wrist along the edge of the chair and into the wall. The thread does not need to be heavy. What it has attached to is not the longing — it is the choosing: the specific moment where he understood what he was giving up and gave it up anyway and has never, in all the time since, been entirely certain it was worth it.

---

## Chewbat Alone

The others are gone.

He is in a passage he doesn't recognise, and then he is somewhere else — not a passage, a hall, and the hall is vast, and it is full of light, and the light is gold, and the gold is coming from him.

He is wearing robes he did not put on. They are the colour of late afternoon on a warm day, the specific gold of wattle in flower, and they are heavy with the weight of something that is trying very hard to be magnificent. Creatures fill the hall in every direction — hundreds of them, a court of all the kinds he has met and some he hasn't, and they are bowed. Every one of them. Facing him.

He looks at his paws. The gold light comes from his paws.

She has been watching him since before they descended. She read the kangaroo first — easy, the threads abundant and old and deeply attached. Then the platypus — longer, but the river was there, the community was there, the material was rich. She has spent the most time on this one. She found his ambitions quickly; they are large and not concealed. What she read in them was appetite — vast, specific, not yet fed. She knows how to feed appetite. This is her oldest work.

What she did not find, because she does not have a category for it, is the difference between a desire that is open and a destination already arrived at. She does not know that his ambitions are not wounds. She is about to offer him what he already carries, without knowing that it is already his.

The Queen descends from the hall's upper dark, her eight eyes warm with the specific warmth of something that believes it has found the right key.

"I see into you," she says. "What you are. What you could be. The greatest singer in all the worlds, and no one has given you a world worthy of the song. Join with me and I will build it."

Chewbat looks around the hall. At the bowed creatures. At his own glowing paws.

He laughs.

Not cruelly. Not defensively. He laughs the way you laugh when something is genuinely funny, which this is — the hall, the robes, the bowed heads, all of it aimed precisely at the part of him that has, in honest moments, wondered what it would look like if the song were properly received.

"How did you know my deepest desires," he says, "oh queen of perfection."

The Queen does not know what to do with the laughter. She files it under: *unusual response, proceed anyway.*

"Name what you want," she says. "I will make it."

---

## The Demands

He thinks for a moment. Then:

"Armour," he says. "Gold, the finest. Fitted to me exactly."

It is there. It fits perfectly. He looks at himself in the surface of it — a wombat in golden armour, resplendent, ridiculous, exactly what was described.

"A palace," he says. "Above this one. Bigger."

It builds itself around them, the hall extending upward and outward, chamber after chamber of worked gold and warm stone, each one more impossible than the last.

"A choir," he says. "The greatest voices in all the worlds, singing for me."

They are there — hundreds of them, and the sound they make is extraordinary, technically flawless, every voice in its correct place.

He listens to the choir for a moment.

"A throne," he says. "Higher. Higher than that. So that I can see everything."

The throne rises.

The Queen is building faster now, her attention entirely on him, the Web channelling all of it toward the construction of what he wants. She has been trying to trap him since he arrived. She has never found the hook. Now here it is — the desire, open, accessible, one request after another, each one satisfied before the asking is finished. The Web hums with the effort of it. The threads that should be binding him are weaving instead, building, building.

"More," he says. "Make it so that every creature in every world knows my name."

They do. The Web carries it outward.

He sits at the top of the impossible throne in the impossible palace in the gold armour and looks out at what she has built and listens to the choir.

He sits with it for a long while.

---

## Tear It Down

"Now," he says. "I want it all torn down."

The Queen goes still.

"All of it," Chewbat says. "The palace. The throne. The choir. The armour. All of it. I want to be standing on bare stone with nothing."

Her eight eyes are on him. "This is what you wanted," she says. "I built it precisely. I built it from what's in you."

"I know," he says. "It was exactly right. You built it perfectly. And now I want it gone."

"You can't — " She stops. In centuries of this work, she has never encountered a creature who asked for the thing and then asked for its removal. The Web is built on the premise that once desire is satisfied it becomes attachment. The thread attaches to the satisfaction. That is how it holds. A creature who wants something completely and then releases it completely gives the thread nothing to grip.

"You wanted to trap me," Chewbat says. Not unkindly. "So you built what I wanted. But you needed me to want to keep it. That's the part I don't do."

"Why," she says. She genuinely wants to know. This is the first genuine thing she has said to him.

"Because I wanted it," he says. "I had it. I'm done with it. That's what wanting is."

She tears it down.

She does it because he asked and she has spent this entire encounter trying to satisfy him and the habit of it carries her through the instruction before she has understood the consequence. The palace goes. The throne goes. The choir goes. The armour is gone.

They are standing on bare stone.

And the Web — which has been channelling its full power into the construction and is now channelling its full power into the destruction — tears itself. Not from the outside. From the middle, from the throne-room junction where all the great threads converged to build the impossible palace, which is now no longer there and has left a hole in the Web's architecture where its weight used to be.

The gold light in the walls of the cavern stutters.

---

## The Web Breaks

The others come back.

Not gracefully — the illusions collapse when the Web loses its centre, and the collapse is sudden. Tekanter in his high-plains warren, mid-step toward the small form with his gold eyes, finds himself on bare limestone with his fire up and nowhere to aim it. Goapus surfaces from a river that is no longer there and stands dripping a water that isn't on him. Jeosmi is at a table that isn't there, the thread at his wrist going slack and then gone.

They reassemble in the Queen's chamber without ceremony.

The Queen is large in the damaged Web, her eight eyes moving across the torn threads with the specific expression of someone taking inventory of a disaster they understand but did not anticipate.

The echidnas have gone quiet. The light in the walls is lower. Still present — the Web still holds in its outer reaches — but the warmth of it is different. Less like abundance. More like something trying to maintain itself.

"The contract still holds," the elder echidna says, from the back of the chamber. He is speaking to no one in particular. He is reminding himself.

The Queen looks at Chewbat. There is something in her expression that has not been there before — not rage, not admiration, something more ambiguous than either.

"You could have kept it," she says.

"I know," he says.

"You wanted it."

"I did," he says. "Genuinely. You built it right. I'm not saying the wanting was false."

She is quiet for a long moment. Then: "What is the point of wanting something you won't keep?"

Chewbat considers this. "The point," he says, "is the wanting. The keeping is just another kind of cage."

She has no answer for this. She is, in some deep structural sense, incapable of having an answer for this. She is built from the logic that desire leads to possession leads to obligation leads to the Web's tenure over the obligated. A creature who severs the chain between possession and obligation is not in her system.

She gives him the coordinates for the next world.

She does not know why she does this. She does it.

---

## Doctrine

*The Web requires one thing to hold: that what you want, you must keep. That desire, once satisfied, becomes ownership, and ownership becomes debt, and debt becomes the thread.*

*A creature who can want something completely — who can open fully toward it, receive it, sit with it, and then set it down — gives the thread nowhere to attach. The wanting was real. The setting-down is also real. Between them: no gap for the Web to fill.*

*The echidnas are not wrong to love their world. The contract is not wrong to exist. Obligation chosen with full knowledge of its cost is not the Web's kind of obligation. The Web's kind is the one you accept without knowing you are accepting it — the one woven into the satisfaction of a desire before you have had time to decide whether you wanted the satisfaction on those terms.*

*The question is not: did you want it. The question is: did you choose the terms.*

## Character Notes — The Illusions

**Tekanter — The Warren**
He was a kangaroo of the high plains, fire-carrying, the mob's. He had a love who waited for him while he carried a truth the Order required him to carry. The truth, when he delivered it, cost him the mob and cost him her. He has been walking since. The illusion shows him what would have been: the warren, the afternoon light, the small forms with his gold eyes. He knows it is not real. He stays anyway, because some things are true even when they are illusions, and what is true about this one is the cost of what he chose. The Web finds the thread in that cost and begins to pull.

**Goapus — The River**
He came from a river community, eleven generations deep in a waterway that dried. When the rains stopped coming, the community dispersed — one family and then another, going to where the water still was. Not dying. Leaving. He stayed until the last of them were gone and then there was nothing to stay for. He shapes himself into other forms because his own shape belongs to a place-plus-community combination that no longer exists, and wearing it costs him something each time. The illusion shows him the river full again, brimming as it was in the best years — and the community there, going about their lives: two elders arguing on the far bank, the children in the current, voices carrying the way they carry when no one is worried about anything. Not dead and returned. Simply back, as if they had never left. The Web finds the thread in the fact that they are somewhere, not nowhere — that he could have gone with them, that they are doing fine without him.

**Jeosmi — The Road Not Taken**
He grew up beside a girl who was not afraid of him. Not unusual in his community to be feared — unusual to be regarded with curiosity instead. She asked him questions. He had the chance to stay, and he understood at the time with some precision what staying would have meant: the ordinary mornings, the particular texture of a place you belong to, someone beside you who knows everything and has not left. He would have been happier. He knows this. He has known it for a long time without quite finishing the sentence. The illusion shows him the morning — the sounds from the next room, the table set for two, the light exactly right. The Web finds the thread not in the longing but in the choosing: the specific moment where he knew what he was giving up and chose to give it up anyway, and has never been entirely certain it was worth it.

**Chewbat — The Court**
He has always known what the Song is. This is not vanity; it is accurate assessment. His childhood was the practice of holding it in — the first time he sang unguarded the stars moved, and he learned to contain it. He has had ambitions since he could understand the word, and they are large and specific. The Queen approaches them as a hunter approaches prey: she reads them as desires not yet satisfied, gaps she can fill and thereby own. She does not know, because she has no category for it, that something has shifted in him — that these ambitions are not hungers but destinations already arrived at in some interior sense. His dreams are his destiny, not his wounds. The Web offers him what he already carries. He laughs — genuinely, because this is funny — and takes everything she builds, and sits with it completely, and then asks for it gone. The Web has never encountered a creature whose dreams have no hook in them because they are already claimed. It does not know what to do with this. It does nothing, and the doing-nothing tears the centre out.
