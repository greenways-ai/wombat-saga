# Trial 4: The Mimic-King of the Mirror Maze

## Village

**Between.** A community of echidnas living in the spaces between mirror-surfaces. The elder stopped making decisions eleven years ago — every decision shows her the version of herself who chose otherwise, and that version looks fine, and if she looks fine either way, what does it matter?

**Villager:** The elder. Paralysed not by incapacity but by the infinite availability of alternatives. All choices visible = no choice made.

---

## Monster

**The Mimic-King.** Was originally something small that ran — a creature from another world, fast, entirely itself. Came to the Mirror Maze and became fascinated with its own reflection, then with copying other things. Has been copying for three hundred years trying to find the copy that feels like home. Every copy is perfect at the surface and hollow at the centre. He cannot close the gap.

**Underlings:**
- *The Reflections* — copies of everyone who has passed through; used as scouts and decoys
- *The Still-Ones* — people who became their own reflection and stopped moving entirely
- *The Doublers* — pairs who have forgotten which is the original

---

## Distraction

A Reflection takes the form of Tekanter and produces his distress-register call — the frequency his body responds to involuntarily. Includes a real fire (reflection caught sunlight at wrong angle) so the emergency is genuine. The voice keeps moving north-west as Tekanter approaches. He realises after twenty minutes the source isn't fixed. Goes back.

---

## Capture

The Mimic-King creates a perfect copy of Chewbat while he's examining a mirror-surface. The copy steps out. Chewbat is drawn through by curiosity — the reflection is doing something slightly different and he leans in to find the wrongness. The copy accompanies Jeosmi and Goapus for three hours.

**Detection:** Jeosmi metabolises and gets nothing new — only what he put in, returned exactly. A closed loop. He tests it: says something obscure; the copy replies with something Chewbat said three weeks ago. *That was mine.*

---

## Rescue

Tekanter tests the copy: *What was I thinking when I said that?* Half-second pause. *That's the gap.*

In the Mimic-King's hall, forty copies of Tekanter are created; every move countered. **Tekanter sits down.** The copies were made from a Tekanter who does not sit in confrontations. They loop, interfere with each other, dissolve.

He finds Chewbat's chamber by pressing a palm against the mirror-surface and leaping away from it at a precise angle — the frequency returns slower where something adds mass on the other side. He hits it with his forehead and the surface opens.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

Inside the mirror, Chewbat watches his own replacement for three hours. Sees himself from outside — the patterns, the pauses, the consistency of his behaviour. The copy reproduces everything. **What it cannot reproduce is the space between moves** — the deliberate incompleteness of listening before acting.

*I cannot copy the listening. The listening leaves no surface to replicate.*
*Because it doesn't produce anything. It receives.*

**The Mimic-King's wound:** Lost its original form to the process of copying. Thought the next copy would feel like home. The together — Image and Song simultaneously — requires the original. A copy can hold one or the other but never both.

---

## Doctrine

*Identity is not continuity of surface. The copy is perfect at the surface and empty at the centre because the centre is not a thing that holds still to be copied — it is the movement between states, the deliberate incompleteness of a thing that is still becoming. Your gaps are your proof. Your delays are your depth. Only what is finished can be perfectly replicated, and only the living thing still refuses to finish.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**Chapters 56–58: The Six-Eared Macaque (六耳獼猴) — the direct source**
This is the most celebrated episode in JTTW and the direct inspiration for Trial 4. A demon appears who is an exact duplicate of Sun Wukong in every respect: same face, same weapon, same abilities, same knowledge, same voice. He beats Xuanzang, steals the pilgrims' belongings, and takes up residence with a group of monkey demons claiming to be the real Sun Wukong.

The real Sun Wukong and the fake fight their way from earth to the Jade Emperor (who cannot distinguish them), to Guanyin's island (who cannot distinguish them), to the Hall of Hell where Dizang the Bodhisattva checks the Book of Life and Death (still cannot distinguish them). Finally they go to the Buddha, who can tell them apart.

The Buddha's method: he does not examine surface — appearance, voice, weapons, behaviour. He reads *inner nature*. The Six-Eared Macaque is a monkey who can hear everything through six ears, replicate any form, knows all things — but cannot achieve the same enlightenment as Wukong because his nature is to hear and copy, not to transcend. The real Wukong's nature is different at a level no appearance can replicate.

Tekanter sitting still as resolution is the same logic. The copies were made from a Tekanter who does not sit in confrontations. Chosen stillness is a behaviour that emerges from nature, not habit — the copies can replicate habit, not nature. The Mimic-King is the Six-Eared Macaque: perfect at surface, empty at centre.

**Chapter 57: "Which is the real one?" — the epistemological crisis**
When no authority can distinguish the real Sun Wukong from the fake, the other pilgrims are temporarily paralysed — they cannot continue without knowing who their companion is, and they cannot know who their companion is. The Mirror Maze village (elder who stopped making decisions because every decision shows its alternative) is the same crisis: infinite alternatives with no distinguishing principle. The resolution in JTTW is the Buddha's insight into inner nature. The resolution in Trial 4 is Jeosmi's metabolic detection: the copy generates nothing new. A living system and its reflection are distinguished by what the living one produces without being prompted.

### Other Mythology

**The Doppelgänger (German folklore)**
The exact double — a being that looks identical to a living person, often regarded as an omen of death or as the uncanny intrusion of the otherworldly into the everyday. The doppelgänger cannot be distinguished from the original by appearance; it is distinguished by what it does with its existence. The Mimic-King's copies are doppelgängers who have outlived their original function (once a copy is made and used, what does it do next?). They loop, endlessly, through the behaviours they were made from.

**The Fetch (Irish)**
An apparition identical to a living person — seen by others as an omen. If seen in the morning, the person will live long; at night, they will die soon. The fetch is the original person's death, already walking around. The Mirror Maze's Still-Ones (people who have become their own reflection) are fetches of themselves.

**Ka (Ancient Egyptian)**
The Egyptian concept of the ka — the double, the life-force that accompanies a person through life and survives death. The ka required the physical body or a statue to inhabit; without it, the ka was lost. The Mimic-King's copies are kas without originals — doubles that have outlived the person they were made from, still moving, unable to die, unable to be fully present.

**Narcissus (Greek/Ovid)**
Narcissus falls in love with his own reflection — cannot reach it, cannot leave it, wastes away staring. The Mirror Maze's Still-Ones are the same: people who have become so absorbed in their reflected alternatives that they stop moving. Narcissus's problem is not vanity but inability to distinguish the reflection from the real thing. The elder echidna's paralysis (every choice shows its alternative; all alternatives look equally real) is precisely Narcissus's condition applied to decision rather than desire.
