## Arrival

The troupe steps onto a plain of white that has no edge and no smell. The cold is not weather — it is the plain itself, reaching. The sky is the same white as the ground and the horizon is the place where they meet and cannot be told apart.

Across the flat, the Choir. Two hundred voices in perfect formation, the sound arriving before the source is visible — a harmony so complete it has no seams, no breath, no accident. Chewbat's chest opens toward it and then something underneath the opening notices that the note has not changed since they arrived and will not change and the opening becomes something else.

The crystal formations rise from the flat in clusters — low, angular, geometric, too regular to be natural. The troupe moves through them. The shapes are specific. Later they will understand what they are looking at. Not yet.

---

## The Garden

The Salt Pan is not a landscape. It is a garden.

The Bunyip has been cultivating it for centuries. At the centre of the plain, burned into the salt crust and extending outward to the horizon, a pentagram of enormous scale — each arm a trench of darker salt, black-edged, the kind of mark left by something very old and very deliberate. The pentagram divides the plain into five sections. In each section, planted in dense geometric formation — concentric arcs, radial lines, spirals — the bodies.

Not dead. Not alive. Each one standing in its position with its face to the sky, its mouth open, the Choir's note passing through it. They were brought here over time, one by one, and processed, and placed. The salt has taken them slowly from the outside in, crystallising the surface first, then working inward. The older ones are nearly indistinguishable from the salt formations around them. The newer ones still have faces.

At the heart of each garden section, embedded in the salt, a cluster of white jars. Squat, wide-mouthed, sealed, identical — frozen white, opaque. They do not glow. They do not move. The geometry of the planted bodies in each section is oriented toward the jars at the centre the way formal gardens orient toward their centrepiece. Everything leads inward to the jars.

Below the pentagram, reached through a fissure at its centre: the cave.

---

## The Cave

The Bunyip does not live on the plain. She lives below it.

The cave is low-ceilinged, vast, the walls of compressed salt embedded with shelves of salt-stone from floor to ceiling. On every shelf: jars. The same jar — squat, wide-mouthed, sealed, clear glass — each one containing something icy blue that moves very slightly when looked at directly and is still when looked away from. The cave is lit entirely by the collective cold blue of what is stored in it. No other light source. The blue runs from the nearest shelf into the far dark, hundreds of jars, thousands, the light compounding until the furthest visible point is simply a cold haze and beyond that: more jars.

At the centre of the cave floor, on bare salt with nothing around it: one jar. The same shape as all the others. But this one is not blue. It holds dirty brown water, silted at the bottom, the colour of a river that has not run in a very long time. No light in it. The only dark point in the cave.

This is her emblem. The last water from the river she abandoned. She has kept it since the day she ran.

The glass coffins are here too — a row of them along the cave's far wall, each one precisely sized, each one fitted with a narrow tube that runs from the glass to a jar mounted above it. The jar fills as the process runs. Blue, slow, rising.

## The Monster

**The Bunyip of the Crystal Salt Pan.**

She was a guardian animal — a mount — of the Royal Order of the Wattle: nine divine aspects of golden light, each with a guardian animal who bore them through the Heart Worlds. She bore one of the nine. She was, for centuries, exactly what she was supposed to be.

Then she ran.

The Windmaster — mount of another of the nine — had the same idea at the same time. They left together. Away from the Order, away from the Wattle's service, into the gap left by Mirene's distracted consciousness. They were going to live in this world together, free, nobody's mount. They were going to be together forever.

The Windmaster left. Went north. No forwarding address.

She is a sorcerer. This is important. She is not a climate or a system or a force of nature — she is a practitioner of ancient craft who has been working her art for centuries and is very, very good at it. Her medium is salt. Her instrument is her voice. Her craft is naming.

She can look at a creature and read its tender places — the parts still turned toward something absent, still reaching, still waiting. She names those places aloud, one by one, and the naming fixes them. The salt adheres to what has been named. The named thing stops moving. Over seven days, everything is named and fixed and the spirit comes loose from the body and rises, and she collects it in a jar, and the body goes into the garden.

The salt is not her grief. It is what remained when she abandoned the waterway she was guardian of and the water evaporated. She did not make the salt. She found it when she came back and the Windmaster was gone, and she has been making use of it since. The garden is not a monument to loss. It is the work of someone who needed something to do with her hands.

The jar of river water at the centre of the cave is the one thing she has never processed. The one thing she has kept rather than made use of. She does not examine why.

**Underlings:**
- *The Choir* — the mid-process. Two hundred creatures planted in the garden sections, face to the sky, still singing because the singing is part of the drawing-out — the voice helps lift the spirit up and out, the way a wick draws oil. They are being used as instruments of their own processing. They have no category for what is happening to them. They have no category for anything anymore.
- *The Salt-Architects* — maintain the pentagram's geometry, extend the garden's boundaries, tend the planted bodies, monitor the progress of the processing.
- *The Bound* — the fully processed. Their spirits are in the jars. Their bodies move through the cave and the plain in the service of the work. They are not unhappy. They are not anything.

## Village

**The Gourd-Borow.** A cluster of dwellings built in deep, geometrically perfect depressions at the plain's edge. The inhabitants move with a careful rigidity, each step measured, as if they are listening to a law they cannot disobey.

**The Bilby:** A frantic, hospitable creature who maintains an immaculate home. She offers her guests warm broth and a place to rest, her eyes constantly darting toward the white haze of the plain. Her daughter was taken into the Choir seven months ago for a minor deviation in rhythm — she hummed an unscheduled note one morning and the Salt-Architects came that night. Mernine has not seen her since. She does not tell the troupe any of this.

---

## Distraction

Tekanter, his keen hearing catching a low pulse in the crystal beneath the floor — patterned, deliberate, coming from the northeast — goes out to investigate. He believes he is securing the perimeter while the others rest.

He is two hundred paces out when the source moves. He adjusts. It moves again. He stops and understands: not an anomaly. A lure. Positioned to draw a fire-bearer away from the dwelling while the dwelling does what it has been arranged to do.

He turns and runs. He is not fast enough.

---

## Capture

The broth is drugged. The troupe does not know this. The reader does not know this. Jeosmi's thoughts go slow and wrong. He tries to stand. He cannot. Then it is dark.

The wall of the borow opens without sound. Not broken — opened, the way a filing cabinet opens, because that is what it is. The underlings enter. They do not look at the drugged bodies on the floor except to step around them. They look only at Chewbat. One of them crouches and arranges his arms, tilts his head back slightly, checks the set of his shoulders. The care is not kindness. It is preparation — the way you prepare something that needs to travel without being damaged.

Goapus's outstretched arm is in the way. One of the underlings sets it aside without looking at him. Picks it up by the wrist. Places it at his side. Steps over him. When they leave, the same underling replaces the arm. Puts it back exactly where it was.

The daughter walks in through the opening before it closes. She goes to the corner and sits with her knees drawn up. She does not look at the sleeping bodies. She has been here before.

The wall is solid again. The hearth-fire flickers. Nothing in the room has changed except that Chewbat is gone and someone is sitting in the corner who was not there before.

---

## Aftermath

Tekanter returns to find the borow silent and the Singer gone. The betrayal is a scent on the air. In a blind rage, he towers over the cowering Bilby, his fist raised to strike her down. He is stopped only by Goapus, who catches the blow with the fluid strength of a rising tide.

"Violence will not find the path," Goapus murmurs.

While Tekanter seethes in the corner, Goapus kneels beside the Bilby, offering her his own ration of water. He consoles her until the shame breaks and she tells them everything. The arrangement. The daughter. The keep at the centre of the plain, reached through the fissure at the pentagram's heart.

---

## The Embalming

The daughter speaks then. Not because anyone asked. She speaks the way someone speaks when they have been somewhere and the somewhere is still in them and the only relief is to let it out.

Her voice is flat. Not from simplicity — from absence. Her spirit is in a jar in the cave below the plain. What came back to Mernine was the body. The body still functions. It speaks. It sits. It follows instructions. There is no one home.

She describes the glass coffin. The salt in the air, falling slowly. The voice reciting the names of each thing she remembered, one by one, each name landing like a hook, drawing the named thing to the surface where the salt took it. By the third day the memories began to organize themselves without prompting. By the fifth day she stopped understanding why she had ever resisted. By the seventh day there was nothing left that wanted anything.

She does not describe what it felt like when the spirit left. She does not have words for this. She has been carefully relieved of the capacity to form them.

---

## Second Capture

The daughter cannot tell them where the fissure opens — the plain shifts and the entrance moves. Tekanter tracks it with his hearing, following the harmonic of the Choir across the white flat, reading the garden as he moves through it. His eyes read the formations for what they are now. He does not slow down.

He finds the fissure by the cold that rises from it.

He goes in fighting. He fights like the devil — leaping from wall to wall of the descent, striking at the Salt-Architects who come at him, the iron-tipped tail clearing the narrow passage, his gold eyes reading every movement before it arrives. He reaches the cave floor and he is enormous in it and for a moment the Bound do not know what to do with him.

The Bunyip names him.

She does not shout. She speaks at a normal volume from across the cave, in the specific cadence of her craft, and what she names is the tender place she has read in him from a distance — something specific, something true, something he has never said aloud. The named thing surfaces and the salt in the air moves to it and the crystal forms at his wrists and ankles before he has finished his next step.

He does not stop fighting. He fights from the chains. He fights until there is nothing left to fight and then he is still, bound, added to the cave's inventory, the Bunyip already turning back to the coffin where Chewbat lies on his third day, the salt still not adhering, her craft failing in a way it has never failed before.

---

## The Ruse

With their warrior in chains, Goapus and Jeosmi work through what remains.

Goapus transforms into a bilby — not mimicry, a true becoming, down to the heartbeat and the salt-dust on the fur and the specific hollowed rhythm of a creature that has been in the plain's proximity long enough to begin to go. Jeosmi renders himself invisible — not absent, but present in the gap between light and perception, walking in the shadow of Goapus's transformed shape.

They offer themselves to the wind. The search-parties find them on the second pass — they were looking for correct geometry, and Goapus *is* correct geometry now. The underlings carry him down through the fissure. Jeosmi follows between their footsteps, unseen.

---

## The Discovery

The cave opens below them and the blue of the jars is everywhere — cold, sourceless, the colour of something that was alive and is now very still. The shelves recede into dark in every direction. The glass coffins along the far wall, each one with its tube, each tube running to a jar slowly filling.

Chewbat is in the third coffin. Day three. The salt in the air above him is moving correctly. The chant has been recited correctly. The salt is not adhering. The Bunyip stands at the coffin with her hands moving in the patterns of her craft, her voice low and precise, naming each thing she can read in him — and finding that each named thing moves before the salt can take it, drawn back into motion by something she cannot name because it has no tender place, because it is not reaching toward anything absent, because it simply *is* and the salt needs something that is waiting and this creature is not waiting for anything.

She has been at this for three days. Her voice, which is her instrument, is wearing. She does not stop.

Tekanter is against the cave wall in crystal chains, watching.

At the cave's centre, on the bare floor: the jar of dirty river water. Still.

---

## Rescue

The Choir begins to re-name when the troupe enters the cave. It finds Goapus — bilby, correct geometry, hollow-hearted — and assigns him his position. It finds Jeosmi and finds nothing and moves on.

Then Goapus transforms.

Not smoothly. A bilby is present and then a platypus is present and the Choir tries to hold both and cannot. It reassigns. He becomes rock. It tries the geological record. He becomes thornbush. It tries the botanical. He becomes bilby again. The Choir is doing something that could be called screaming if it were not singing. The note it holds becomes something that does not sit correctly in any chest in the cave.

The Bunyip turns from the coffin.

In this moment — her attention broken, the Choir's naming interrupted — Jeosmi steps out of the invisible and releases fire.

The coffin opens. Chewbat stands up. The salt has found nothing to adhere to across three days of her best work. His inner song is intact and moving.

Tekanter watches the Choir lose its formation. The chains that bind him were named precisely — every blow, every kick, every guard recorded and held. They did not record what a kangaroo does when the only direction is up. He gathers himself and leaps straight through the ceiling of his bindings. The chains hold his weight for one second and then the geometry of what he is doing exceeds what was named, and the crystal shatters, and he lands beside the coffin.

The Bunyip is now facing all four of them.

---

## Key Emotional Beat

She works. Even now, she works — her hands moving in the naming-patterns, her voice finding each tender place in each creature before her, trying to fix them one by one in sequence, the salt in the air moving to each named thing as she names it. Goapus transforms before she can fix him. Jeosmi shifts element. Tekanter — she names his tender place again and watches it surface and the chains begin to form again and he tears them off before they close and her voice goes to the next name.

She cannot name Chewbat. She has been trying for three days. There is nothing to find.

She is working at full capacity. She has not worked at full capacity in a very long time.

It is Chewbat who speaks.

Not loudly. Not as a weapon. With the open curiosity of someone who has looked at her and seen the thing behind the craft.

**"Where did the Windmaster go?"**

She stops.

Not pauses — stops. The hands stop. The naming stops. The salt in the air stops moving and hangs where it is and begins, slowly, to fall as ordinary salt.

The Choir holds its note.

At the centre of the cave floor, the jar of dirty river water moves. Not much — a single slow ripple crossing the surface, dying at the glass. It has not moved since the day she filled it. It has been perfectly still through centuries of her most disciplined work. The word *North* has not yet been said and already the water is moving, because the question has been asked and the water knows what the answer is and has always known.

She says: *North.*

One word. Flat. The word she has said to herself ten thousand times in silence, which is the same as never saying it. Said aloud now, to another creature, in the cave that holds all her work, beside the jar she has never processed.

The water ripples again. Stills.

The Choir's note wavers once and holds.

---

## The Revelation

The Bunyip stops mid-sentence.

Not pauses — stops. Her mouth is still open in the shape of the word she was saying when something moved through her from below, something that found the hollow she had made of herself and filled it, the way water fills the exact shape of what contains it.

Her head moves. Not the way she moves her head. Slower. Down first, then up, as if it has been lowered and raised by something that has never had a head before and is learning the motion.

Her eyes are different.

She opens her mouth again and what comes out has her voice's register but not its quality. It is older. It is warm in a way her voice has not been warm in a very long time. It comes from below the floor, from below the salt, from the place where the river was before the water left.

*You are still the guardian. The waterway still exists. The water can return.*

Her hands have opened at her sides. She did not open them.

The jars break.

Not violently — they give, the same way the coffin glass gave, softly, the way ice gives when the season finally changes. Every jar on every shelf at once, the blue light in the cave shifting and rising as the contents come free — icy blue, hundreds of points of cold light lifting from the broken glass, moving upward through the cave ceiling toward the plain above, each one finding the way back through the salt to the body it came from. The garden above is receiving them. The Choir's note breaks into individual voices, each one different, each one briefly confused, and then the singing stops.

In the centre of the cave floor the jar of river water is unbroken. It was never sealed the way the others were sealed. The water moves in slow circles, once, twice, and is still.

Then the divine presence is gone.

The Bunyip has to find herself again. Where her hands are. How she was standing. She looks down at her open palms for a long moment. She closes them. She looks up.

She is smaller. Not damaged — smaller, the way a room is smaller after a very large thing has been in it and left. The hard geometry of her has gone soft. Her pelt is the colour of wattle blossom. She looks, briefly, like the animal she was before she ran — and then her face arranges itself and she files even this under: *pending. Do not open.*

---

## The Blessing

The warmth gathers once more — briefly, specifically — and turns toward the troupe.

Its voice, through the air rather than through the Bunyip, is the sound of a thousand hives. Heavy. Warm. The promise of rain.

"You have borne the weight where others would have shattered. The Heart-World remembers its own."

Two keys come out of the warmth — old, heavy, each one making a sound in the bones rather than the ears. One goes to Chewbat. One goes to Tekanter.

Then it is gone entirely. The cave walls are softening. Above, through the fissure, the plain is different — the garden breaking up, the geometric formations loosening, the pentagram's lines blurring at the edges as the work that held them in place comes undone.

The first trial is complete.

---

## Doctrine

*The one who builds a world to avoid a question has not escaped the question. They have given it a larger room. The Salt Pan is a larger room for* North. *The garden is planted around the question. The Choir sings to drown it out. None of this prevents it. It only delays the day when the stillness comes and the water moves and the question is there, waiting.*

*The answer does not have to be good. It is required to be the answer.*

## Source Material

### Journey to the West — Primary References

**The Celestial Bureaucracy (multiple chapters)**
The JTTW heavenly administration is not corrupt so much as completely process-bound: things are done in the correct order, filed in the correct record, processed through the correct channels. When Sun Wukong arrives demanding the position of Great Sage Equal to Heaven, the celestial officials give him a title that means "empty rank" — they found a category for him rather than denying him, because the bureaucracy prefers categorisation over conflict. Sun Wukong cannot be refused entry to heaven; he can only be given a role so minor it means nothing. The Salt Pan's Choir functions on identical logic: everything that enters must be named. The crisis is not malice but completeness — the system's need to account for everything within its boundary.

**Chapters 75–77: Sun Wukong swallowed by the Blue-Haired Lion**
Sun Wukong is swallowed whole, sealed inside a warm dark space with no visible exit. He reconstitutes violently from inside — grows to full size, tears the demon apart. This is the structural source of Tekanter's rescue: capture → chains → the leap that was not in the filing. In Trial 1 the capture is the naming of his tender place, and the escape is the movement the naming did not account for.

**Chapter 59–61: Princess Iron Fan and the uncontrollable force**
The Iron Fan controls a force that has become self-sustaining — Flame Mountain burns without ceasing. The Princess controls the fan but will not deploy it; her control over the force has become her identity. She cannot deploy the fan because using it would mean the force was over, and the force being over means she has nothing left to control. The Bunyip's garden is the same architecture: a work she continues because continuing is the only thing that remains. Stopping would mean being in the stillness. She does not stop.

### Other Mythology

**Calypso (Homer, Odyssey, Books I and V)**
The nymph who keeps Odysseus on her island for seven years. She is genuinely kind. She makes the island into something to maintain, something to offer — perfect, enclosed, self-sufficient. Odysseus leaves. The island remains. The Bunyip's garden is Calypso's island after Odysseus has left: the thing she maintained is still there, still being maintained, still being extended. The one she maintained it for is gone. She maintains it anyway, because stopping is not in her system, and because stopping is stillness, and stillness is where the question lives.

**Circe (Homer, Odyssey)**
The sorceress who transforms sailors into animals, organized and kept — not for food, but for company, for management, for having something to do with her power. The garden's bodies echo Circe's organized inhabitants: given exactly their category, not unhappy, unable to leave. The Bunyip has more precision and less warmth than Circe. The effect is structurally identical.

**Persephone's return (Greek)**
When Persephone is in the underworld, Demeter withholds spring. The world becomes cold and still. This is usually read as grief — Demeter mourning her daughter. But it is also fury, imposed order, the refusal to let anything grow because what she needed is not here. The Salt Pan is Demeter's winter with the grief removed: just the fury, just the stillness, just the organized refusal to allow anything to bloom in a space where the one she loved is not.

**The Royal Order of the Wattle**
Nine divine aspects of the Wattle's true spirit — beings of golden light, each with a guardian animal mount. The Wattle is the plant that protects Mirene and heals her body; the Royal Order are the spirit presences that the Wattle's consciousness throws off to guard and extend its reach through the Heart Worlds. The guardian animals bore the divine aspects through the Heart Worlds. The Bunyip and the Windmaster deserted together. This is the only desertion in the Order's history.
