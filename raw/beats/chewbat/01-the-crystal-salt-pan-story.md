## Arrival

the troupe moves into the first heart world. it was barren, dry, when rivers running dry and a great salt plain in the distance. they cannot get any fresh water. they see a village next to the river and go there to get water. the reach an elderly bilby named **Mallee** who tells them of the beautiful spirit. she provided abundance when the bilby choir sings to her but because a rebel bilby named **Mulga** mislead 80% of the village away, the land became dry and the kidnappings continue.

There is an underground well that has water so the elderly, but she asks that if the troupe can give assistance with the rebels to eliminate the leader and return prosperity to the village.

Tekanter volunteers to go. He crosses mountains in leaps and bounds until he finds the lair. He calls out for the leader bilby, **Mulga**, to come out and fight, and even bashes a couple of the guards around. Finally the bilby comes out and they fight but they are matched for power and strength. even though the bilby is tiny. Tekunter is stunned and notices a tattoo of discernment on the bilby's neck, the same one he has got beneath the fur. Tekanter stops the fight and they talk.

It seems that a strange evil has fallen on the land and the beautiful spirit has been either captured or gone crazy. the bilby has not mislead 80% of the village - the village has been snatched away in the middle of the night by shadows. then bilbies are found arranged in circles in the salt plains as part of a choir

 in fact his group has been rescuing and treating choir bilbies but the issue is that there is a great supernatural evil and the rescue bilbies are not better and the rescuers then get targeted.

 Mulga is part of Tekanter's order and the tattoo symbolises that he cannot tell a lie, otherwise he loses his power. Tekanter then tests him again, and Mulga says something that Tekanter knows is true. he is now worried for his buddies.

 When he returns it is found that the village was a mirage, Chewbat has been abducted and the two of them were drugged and as asleep on the dry river bank.

 When he returns, he chides the other two for losing Chewbat then, as they were about to get into a fight, he storms off. the only clue he had was from the outcast bilbies saying that entrace to the lair are usually decorated to a circle of singing bilbies. he starts going around looking. He does find the bilbies as well as the fissuer and calls the bilbies out. 
 
 At the centre of the plain, burned into the salt crust and extending outward to the horizon, a pentagram of enormous scale — each arm a trench of darker salt, black-edged, the kind of mark left by something very old and very deliberate. The pentagram divides the plain into five sections. In each section, planted in dense geometric formation — concentric arcs, radial lines, spirals — the bodies.

 Each one standing in its position with its face to the sky, its mouth open, the Choir's note passing through it. They were brought here over time, one by one, and processed, and placed. The salt has taken them slowly from the outside in, crystallising the surface first, then working inward. The older ones are nearly indistinguishable from the salt formations around them. The newer ones still have faces.

He goes in fighting. He fights like the devil — leaping from wall to wall of the descent, striking at the Salt-Architects who come at him, the iron-tipped tail clearing the narrow passage, his gold eyes reading every movement before it arrives.

Then he feels bound as think black energy evalopes his body. He has been captured by the bilby.

Goapus and Jeosmi follow in Tekanter's footsteps and the see his capture. however, because it looked too powerful they didn't interview and instead found Mulga to ask for more information. Whilst they were there, they spoke ot a rescued bilby who told them of her kidnap and embalming.

She describes the glass coffin. The salt in the air, falling slowly. The voice reciting the names of each thing she remembered, one by one, each name landing like a hook, drawing the named thing to the surface where the salt took it. By the third day the memories began to organize themselves without prompting. By the fifth day she stopped understanding why she had ever resisted. By the seventh day there was nothing left that wanted anything.

She does not describe what it felt like when the spirit left. She does not have words for this. She has been carefully relieved of the capacity to form them.

With their warrior in chains, Goapus and Jeosmi work through what remains.

Goapus transforms into a bilby — not mimicry, a true becoming, down to the heartbeat and the salt-dust on the fur and the specific hollowed rhythm of a creature that has been in the plain's proximity long enough to begin to go. Jeosmi renders himself invisible — not absent, but present in the gap between light and perception, walking in the shadow of Goapus's transformed shape.

The underlings carry him down through the fissure. Jeosmi follows between their footsteps, unseen.

The cave opens below them and the blue of the jars is everywhere — cold, sourceless, the colour of something that was alive and is now very still. The shelves recede into dark in every direction. The glass coffins along the far wall, each one with its tube, each tube running to a jar slowly filling.

Chewbat is in the third coffin. Day three. The salt in the air above him is moving correctly. The chant has been recited correctly. The salt is not adhering. The Bunyip stands at the coffin with her hands moving in the patterns of her craft, her voice low and precise, naming each thing she can read in him — and finding that each named thing moves before the salt can take it, drawn back into motion by something she cannot name because it has no tender place, because it is not reaching toward anything absent, because it simply *is* and the salt needs something that is waiting and this creature is not waiting for anything.

Tekanter is against the cave wall in crystal chains, watching.

Jeosmi in his invisible form, inties the chains for Tekanter. they wait for a moment of opportunity before smashing the coffins of Goapus and Chewbat. The troupe race above ground as the Bunyip lady gives chanse and as they reach the top, the queen turns in to a hideous bunyip, breathing magic and with the bonds. The illusion of the bilbies holding the water jars suddenly shatter and they turn to run off.

the troupe fights with the Bunyip and is almost about to capture her but she suddenly dissolves into black enery and goes back towards the hole.

Tekanter recognises from his time as a servant in the company of the nine divine wattle celestials that the black enery was part of the binding of the animal to its owner and he remembered a celestial with a rabbit that had the same notch in the bunyip's ear. he sent a message to the celestials, and explained the situation. The bunny celestial came down and sang a lullaby at the entrance of the fissue. the bunyip came out growing, saw the celestial and started transforming uncomtrollably, as the bunyip transformed, voices of pain and suffering were unleashed from the bunyip until a cute bunny remained. the divine then told the troup of how she ran away with another mount, thanked the troupe and gave chewbat the coordinates for the next world
