## I. The Dreamer (The Dust-Bearer's Son)

- **The Setting:** The Eucalyptus Groves (*Aldar Nénëa*) — the marginal zone where the eastern and western shells meet, surface-adjacent, where the underground connects directly to the air above. Stringybark trees. Moisture-rich soil. The air smells of eucalyptus and rain. Breathing here is, the city would say, an act of subversion. Cornelibat's burrow is dug in real clay — no Safety Grout, no grid tunnel access, no Tally-notch. Walls packed by paws, not poured by industry.
- **Agathaboo (the mother):** She loves Cornelibat's stories. She also knows, with the precision of someone who has watched one person get exiled, exactly what happens to wombats who act on those stories. She represents the gap between knowing something is true and believing you're allowed to say so. She is not a coward — she is a mathematician who has done the calculation and doesn't like the answer.
- **Cornelibat (the father):** Former Root-Counter. Exiled for compassion — the specific charge was "Unauthorised Substrate Consultation," which means he was caught listening to the earth when the Tally said the earth had nothing to say. At night, when the Grotto's sounds were far away and the eucalyptus moved overhead, he told Hoebat about the **Dust-Bearers**: the ancient wombats who tended the earth by listening to it, who read the substrate not as dead material to be conquered but as a living record of everything that had passed through it. The stories were forbidden. Cornelibat told them in the voice he used for everything important — matter-of-fact, quiet, like he was reciting weather.
- **The ambition:** Hoebat practices listening to the earth while other juveniles play Grout-Tag in the upper Grotto corridors. He learns to distinguish the hum of living substrate from the flat tone of Grout-sealed walls. He doesn't know yet that this is the beginning of an education. He thinks he's just doing what his father told him was worth doing.

## II. The Academy of Structural Compliance

- **The commute:** Every day, in from the Eucalyptus Groves to the Sector 7 Academy in the Gray Grotto mid-levels. The route takes him through the Wet Bend (where condensation collects in the invert — one of the few places in Melborow you can smell moisture without paying for it), past the North-West Corridor (broken lighting even then, a compromised springline the Council had been noting for a decade and not fixing), and into the academy's grid-tunnel entrance. The contrast is total: from Groves-clay to Grout in ten minutes' walk.
- **The curriculum:** Safety Grout Geometry. Static-Logic. The official position is that the earth is dead material — inert, stupid, a problem to be solved by correct application of formula. The Tally measures yield per metre. The academy teaches you to maximise the Tally. Hoebat sits in the back of these classes with his claws on the floor, feeling the substrate hum under the Grout, and says nothing.
- **Barnabat:** His friend. Bright, funny, practical — the kind of wombat who finds a way to make the rules work for him rather than fighting them. He thinks Hoebat's substrate-listening is eccentric but interesting. He joins the secret club because he trusts Hoebat, and because the unauthorised tunnels are an adventure.
- **The secret club:** A small group — Hoebat, Barnabat, two others — digging in the Old Way in the unmapped sections adjacent to the academy. Dead Zones. Already under Temporal Cropping, already dark. They follow the feel of the earth, not the formula. The tunnels curve. They are ugly and imprecise and they hold.

## III. The Collapse (The Hero's Moment)

- **The micro-tremor:** The North-West Corridor springline — compromised for years, noted in Council reports for a decade, never fixed — finally fails. The load it had been carrying redistributes through the grid tunnels above the Dead Zone. The Grout-sealed sections, rigid and unforgiving, transfer the shock downward rather than absorb it. The unauthorised tunnels, curved and unlicensed, mostly survive — imprecision bends where formula shatters. Two students who had wandered into a section where the earth was thinner do not. Barnabat is trapped under a collapsed crown section at the far end of the deepest tunnel.
- **The action:** Hoebat does not run. He puts his paws on the collapsed wall and listens. The substrate is still moving — secondary shifts, settling geometry. He is reading the direction of the stress, finding the Soft Spot, the place where the collapse is thinnest, where the substrate hasn't committed to the new geometry yet. He digs. Fourteen minutes. Secondary collapse begins as he pulls Barnabat clear.
- **The belief:** He believes he has just proven everything Cornelibat told him. He believed the Old Way works — not as philosophy, as engineering. He expects to be in trouble for the unauthorized tunnel. He does not expect what follows.

## IV. The Silencing (The Council's Betrayal)

- **The accusation:** The Principal's office. A High Auditor from the Cathedral with a Tally-stone in his paw, which he hasn't put down since he arrived. The stone is perfectly clear. The stone has already decided. The Auditor has a witness statement — Barnabat's — that describes Hoebat as the instigator, the ringleader, the one whose "reckless excavation technique" caused the crown failure. The language is precise. It has been written for Barnabat, not by him.
- **The charge:** Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation. Unauthorised Substrate Modification. The deaths are real. The cause has been reassigned.
- **The betrayal:** Barnabat doesn't meet Hoebat's eyes in the corridor afterward. He has been offered something — a promotion, an erasure of his own involvement, the safety of compliance. He has taken it. Hoebat understands this, later. In the moment, he does not understand anything except that the only person who knows what happened is the person who has just decided it happened differently.
- **The expulsion:** He is removed from the Sector 7 Academy. His record notes the charge. The charge follows him in the Tally. Cornelibat, when he hears, goes very still in a way that is not like him.

## V. The Fracture (The Flight Downward)

- **The argument:** Cornelibat tells him to keep his head down. Not as betrayal — as fear. The specific, precise fear of a wombat who knows exactly what the system does to the ones who push back, who has the scar of his own exile to prove it. He is not telling Hoebat to stop believing what he believes. He is telling him that believing it too loudly costs more than he knows.
- **The explosion:** Hoebat has been raised on Dust-Bearer stories. He has been told, night after night in a Groves burrow with clay walls and no Tally-notch, that the earth speaks and the only job is to listen. And now the man who told him that is telling him to be quiet. He says things he means and will not take back. He calls his father a coward. He does not mean it as an insult. He means it as a diagnosis. He is fifteen years old and he is absolutely certain about everything.
- **The flight:** He does not go to the surface. He goes downward. Not a plan — instinct. The Grotto's unmapped sections are what he knows, what he practiced in, what the academy never reached. He goes into the dark that the Council named Dead Zone and he keeps going.
- **What he finds:**
    - The North-West Corridor: broken lighting, compromised springline. He has walked this route a hundred times on his way to school. Below where he knew it, it continues.
    - The deep unmapped Grotto: tunnels shaped by paws, not poured by industry. Curved. Imprecise. Old.
    - The **Root Cathedral** (*Sulpoyána*): a chamber carved not by paws but by roots — walls shaped by root-paths that have since died or been severed by construction. He finds it by sound. A whisper at one end arrives at the other as a hum, transformed by the chamber's organic geometry into something richer than the sound that entered. He stays there for three days without fully understanding why. Something in it is Cornelibat's stories made architecture.
- **What changes:** He stops believing he needs to be heard. He starts believing he needs to listen. These are not the same thing. The distinction will take years to fully understand, but the Root Cathedral plants it.
- **The beginning of the Kintsugi-Mu:** In the deep tunnels, he starts repairing. Not for anyone. Not for the Tally. Because the walls are cracking and he knows how to read a crack and the clay is still alive under the Grout if you go deep enough to find it. He mends by night in tunnels the Council has abandoned. He is not Hoebat repairing a tunnel. He is the tunnel repairing itself.
