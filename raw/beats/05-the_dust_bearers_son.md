## I. Before the Stories, the People

- **Purpose:** Establish the family before entering the parable structure. Reader needs the soil before the seeds.
- **Cornelibat (the father):** Former Seam-Reader, ex-certified. Removed from the guild the way a grain-running crack gets sealed — because it looked bad, and the official record had no category for *looks bad but is actually working.* Moved the family to the Eucalyptus Groves, dug the burrow by paw in pre-formation clay. Makes tea. Never called the lost certification a tragedy. Tells stories the way most wombats breathe — without deciding to.
- **Agathaboo (the mother):** Ran surface-farm drainage assessments without a Council permit, because the rains came regardless of application status. Has a geologist's note on the wall with *undervalued* underlined in red. Makes good bread. Married a wombat who tells stories and understands this as a full-time occupation with unpredictable hours.
- **The burrow:** Three tunnels in from the stringybark line. No Safety Grout. No registration. The Council's assessment: *Unregistered. No value.* The wall disagreed in silence for as long as Hoebat can remember.
- **The hinge line:** "These are my people. Now the stories." — marks the transition from context to parable.

## II. The Bowl That Sings (The Morribat Story)

- **Hoebat is eight.** Real tea that night — surface-farm tea, bought with margin work. Cornelibat watches the eucalyptus, not his son. Stories need room to move.
- **Morribat:** Eastern deep grid, three generations back. She sat in tunnels, came out, told them where the water was headed. The guild paid per prediction. She was right every time. They didn't ask how — *the how is fragile, put a committee on the how and you lose the what.*
- **The committee:** After her death: four certified Seam-Readers, three engineers, one High Auditor with a Tally-stone. Sixty years later. One report. Her phrase: *Statistically significant anecdotal evidence.* Her tunnels: still standing. Their tunnels: replaced at least twice each, some three times.
- **Cornelibat's delivery:** Not angry — past anger. The wrong is just true now. A feature of the landscape.
- **Hoebat's response:** Paws flat against the clay floor. Has been doing this for two months. Finds something he has no word for yet — depth, patient, older than Melborow. Keeps trying. Cornelibat watches without comment. He has stories for this, but doesn't tell them.

## III. The Margin

- **The Eucalyptus Groves:** The transitional zone the city hasn't decided what to do with. Official maps: *Transitional Zone 4.* No registrations on any of the burrows, which means the Council doesn't count them. Things the Council doesn't count don't exist. The wall exists anyway.
- **The burrow's materials:** Dark blue clay — pre-formation stock, the kind that packs and holds without chemistry. Paw-prints in the walls. The whole history of the place readable in pressure-language. No Safety Grout. No grid access.
- **Agathaboo's wall note:** Surface-farm drainage assessment, unpermitted. The geologist wrote: *exceptionally stable load-bearing material, pre-formation period, undervalued by current assessment models.* She underlined *undervalued* in red where visitors could read it.
- **Pellaboo introduced:** Two burrows down. Father runs the surface-access ladder. Mother makes clay-pressed bread and the only singing bowls in the Groves that make the walls hum back. Pellaboo herself: holds her breath longer than anyone, carries a map of the clay formations in her head that no one drew for her. They played in the dirt, followed the earth because the earth had opinions.
- **Hoebat's distinguishing behavior:** He's the one who lies face-down and presses his ear to the ground. Pellaboo catalogued this in the first week alongside everything else she knew: north is north, wet clay smells different from dry.

## IV. Tallibat

- **The grid-kids:** Come to the margin on late-season weekends when the official tunnels get warm. Boring-probes, formula charts, field books with their names on the covers. Assess sections they have no claim to.
- **Tallibat:** Father is a Safety Grout inspector for Sector 3. Tallibat knows the formula the way other wombats know their own reflection — not from study, from growing up with it everywhere. He is not cruel about it. That would be easier. He is *certain.* The specific certainty of someone who has never been in a room where the formula failed.
- **The finding game:** Tallibat's crew hides a stone. Systematic intervals, boring-probe, documented. Hoebat finds it by lying on the ground and walking eleven paces north-northeast. Then finds it again after Tallibat re-hides it. "That's not a replicable method." "I found it twice." "Anecdotally."
- **The word *anecdotally*:** Hoebat is nine and doesn't know what it means. But he knows the sound of it — the same sound as the official report's phrase for Morribat. Asks Cornelibat.
- **Cornelibat's response:** Goes quiet in a particular way. "Tallibat's father is a Grout inspector." Then: "There were others, you know. After Morribat. Listeners. Not many." And: "Your uncle was one." Sets it down at the edge of a sentence and stops. Hoebat learns not to press sealed walls.

## V. The Water Pocket

- **Hoebat is ten.** Tallibat brings a bigger crew — six, real boring-equipment, ropes, a spirit level — to cut a passage through Groves clay. Permission from no one, since Groves land has no registered owner and in Tallibat's logic, what the Council doesn't own doesn't require permission.
- **Hoebat digging nearby:** For no particular reason except that the earth in that section has been interesting for a week. Following a quality in the hum, the way you follow a smell.
- **The pocket:** The clay changes before he reaches it. The specific weight of water that's been sealed in clay since before anyone built anything above it. Old water. Waiting water. He knows the quality the way he knows the eucalyptus smell. He stops. Angles east. Keeps going.
- **The consequence:** Tallibat's boring-probe punches through the pocket wall. Six juvenile wombats and a spirit level and three field books, soaking wet, backing out of a tunnel that has become a stream.
- **Tallibat's framing:** "Undocumented water pocket. No way to detect without a full substrate survey." — "I went around it." — "You got lucky." — "Twice," says Pellaboo, very quietly.
- **The repair:** Two days, Hoebat and Agathaboo. She redirects the flow into the surface-farm irrigation channel. Teaches him: how clay behaves under pressure, where water wants to go, how you work with the direction of flow instead of against it. "You have to let the earth show you what it's doing."
- **Three weeks later:** Tallibat returns alone. No crew, no probe, no field book. "Show me." Not *please* — Tallibat doesn't have that vocabulary yet. But he came without his crew, and they both know what that cost.
- **The learning:** Hoebat shows him the starting position — paws flat, weight even, stop calculating. Tallibat's paw flexes the calculation reflex back in after forty seconds. "Your paws go flat when you're listening. They flex when you're calculating. Stop." He comes back the following week. And the week after. Never announces what he's looking for. Just comes, presses paws flat, waits until the calculating reflex pulls him back.

## VI. The Bowl-Maker's Daughter

- **Morillaboo's workshop:** Clay walls lined with shelves of singing bowls. Surface kiln that predates the grid's light infrastructure by three generations. Bowls made from Groves clay, shaped by paw, fired by feel.
- **The distinction:** Cathedral-approved alloy bowls ring the same note everywhere, always, regardless of the walls around them. Consistent. Predictable. Dead. Morillaboo's bowls *sing* — different depending on the room, the day, the particular quality of air and clay and whoever is holding them.
- **Her line:** "A singing bowl should sing. Not declare. Not announce. The earth doesn't make one note, Hoebat. The earth makes chords."
- **What Hoebat understands:** Not the mechanics. Just: when Morillaboo strikes her bowls, the Groves clay answers. Like the earth had been listening and the bowl had just said exactly the right thing.
- **Pellaboo's knowledge:** Learns to make bowls the way she learns everything — building the map in her head until she can navigate blind. Knows moisture in clay by resistance. Knows when a wall is too thin by how the material stops pushing back. Ask her how she knows: the mild impatience of someone for whom the question doesn't quite make sense.
- **Tallibat challenges:** "Your mother is making unlicensed bell devices." "Yes." "That's illegal." "Yes." "Uncontrolled bell output can interfere with Grid stability." Pellaboo: "Have you ever heard one?" "I understand the principles—" "Have you ever heard one." Tallibat goes quiet. "Come tomorrow."

## VII. The Listening

- **Tallibat's conversion:** He comes. Of course he comes — his curiosity is always stronger than his certainty, he just needed permission. Pellaboo hands him a medium bowl, dark blue, three weeks from the kiln. "Hold it like this. Flat palm underneath."
- **The bowl's voice:** Not what the Cathedral's single approved tone sounds like. The opposite — not simplicity but fullness. A low note that opens into others, each arriving and staying while the next comes in. The workshop's clay walls answer. The bowls on the shelves lean slightly forward. Seventeen seconds of harmonic conversation.
- **Tallibat's processing:** Paw flexes the calculation reflex — but he doesn't move. Stands through all seventeen seconds. "That's layering. Multiple tones overlapping." Pellaboo: "They eliminate complexity. They call the extra voices interference because they can only measure one thing at a time."
- **The question he finally asks:** "The clay *wants.*" First time Pellaboo smiles at him — not at his confusion. At the question itself.
- **Two hours:** He strikes every bowl. Asks about clay composition, firing temperatures, wall thickness ratios. Same field book, different understanding of what the notes are for.
- **His exit:** "I want to learn. Not for the Grid. For me." — the beginning. Not friendship yet. The beginning was Tallibat discovering the formula he'd been handed was incomplete, and choosing to find out what it left out.

## VIII. The Lesson of Lillaboo

- **Cornelibat reaches for a specific story:** Has many, but only reaches for the specific ones when the specific ones are necessary. This time: Lillaboo. Before Hoebat's mother's time, before his.
- **Lillaboo:** Made working bowls for the Dust-Bearers — not ceremony bowls, the kind they struck in deep tunnels to find each other when the dark was too complete for any other method. Not a Dust-Bearer herself. A potter. But her ear was different: she could strike a bowl before firing and know whether the wall would hold its pitch.
- **The problem:** The Dust-Bearers' old bowls were going quiet. City expansion above, new foundations pressing down, the ground shifting. They needed new ones for the new ground.
- **Her method — first attempt:** Measured everything. Same clay-vein, same kiln temperature, same striker weight. Bowls that by every measurement should have worked. Underground: they rang. Clean. Clear. One note. Perfect by every standard. The Dust-Bearers could not find each other.
- **Her discovery:** Three weeks underground. Cold bread. Seepage water. Alone in the dark striking clay and hearing what the dark returned. The earth is not inert — it breathes, moves, has a voice. Not separate from the bowl's voice. In conversation with it, from the moment the bowl enters the space. Her specifications assumed the earth was dead. The deep clay was not dead.
- **The new method:** Shape each bowl in the specific tunnel, listening to the specific clay above and below and all around. Let the bowl tell her what it needs to be rather than telling the bowl what she needs it to be.
- **Cornelibat's line:** "The Academy teaches you to impose your will on the earth. The Dust-Bearers learned to receive the earth's will and work with it. Both are necessary — but someone must also listen. Or eventually there's nothing left to hold."
- **Hangbat:** "Your uncle understood this. The Wail was not ceremony — it was relationship. Bowl and clay in conversation. Something happening in that conversation that neither side could produce alone." When many bowls sing together in the right space — bowl finding itself through clay, clay answering back. Not words. Not signal. Presence. The specific feeling of being heard by something larger than yourself.
- **The seed:** Hangbat went looking for it fifteen years ago. Found something. Stayed underground. Still there, as far as Cornelibat knows. No map. The Wail doesn't need maps. It needs ears, patience, and bowls that know what they are.
- **Cornelibat's final instruction:** "When you find yourself choosing between being accurate and being safe, choose accurate. The earth keeps records. The Tally forgets. And you'll have to live with yourself in the dark, when the Glow-Panels are off and the formulas don't apply — and in those hours, accuracy is the only company that stays."
- **Close:** Hoebat stays with paws flat on the clay. Listens to the earth breathe. The city glows distant, convinced of its own importance, believing itself the only light.
