# The Morning Glory (Narrative Beats)

**Title:** The Jacaranda Prophecy
**Chronicle-Mu Reference:** Origin of the Prophet Cooroo

---

### Beat 1: The Silent Galah
*   **The Protagonist:** **Cooroo**, a juvenile Galah who has lost his voice. He cannot perform the "Noble Noise" (Laica Róma)—the scream that maps the world.
*   **The Context:** The world of **Hún Nico** (Heart-Shaped Klein Bottle) is **crystallising**. The **Great Wattle** (Malinalda Arata) at the Crown shattered generations ago, and now the **Silver Wattle**—the last of the **Coring Trees** on the Eastern Ridge—has also fallen. 
*   **The Physics of Failure:** In the heart worlds, all coring trees possess extremely deep roots to maintain the connection to the source. The Silver Wattle was the final anchor for the Eastern Colony.
*   **The Crisis:** The **Three Primes** (Kangaroo, Koala, Platypus) are broken or vanished. The **Rosellas** (Synthesis) have fled or been corrupted by the **Lattice Song** (Static). The Galahs remain, but they are purposeless.

### Beat 2: The Shattering of the Silver Wattle
*   **The Event:** The Silver Wattle did not fall naturally; it "shattered." The fall was caused by a dual stress: its heartwood had been replaced by the **Crystalline Lattice** (Static), and the **Wombat Colony’s construction** in its root system had severed its natural support, creating terminal stress in the core. It fell in silence, like a glass tower.
*   **The Aftermath:** Cooroo sits on the **fractured stump**. It is not smooth; a deep fracture runs right down the middle, and the horizontal cut is jagged with **quartz-like breakages** where the crystal lattice snapped under tension. 
*   **Cooriki’s Collapse:** His mother, **Cooriki** (Lead Caller), has gone entirely **inwards**. Her world is shattered, so she has abandoned the external one. She sits on a nearby Eucalyptus, feathers dusty and unkempt, staring not at the stump, but at the void where her life used to be.

### Beat 3: The Dream of the Ridge (The Internal Sanctuary)
*   **The Psychological Retreat:** Because the grey reality is unbearable, Cooriki has retreated into her own narrative memory. In her mind, she is still living in the **Glory Days**. 
*   **The Scene:** She dreams of the Silver Wattle as a soaring cloud of gold. She sees the **Rosella Choir** in the high branches, their feathers like stained glass, braiding the The Chorus into the air. 
*   **The Tragic Contrast:** In her head, the air is thick with the scent of Arnam and the Ridge is a chaotic, noisy, wonderful mess of friends. To the outside observer, she is a catatonic bird on a dead branch. To herself, she is the only one left who remembers what "normal" felt like.

### Beat 4: The Concentrated Sky (The Parasite of Hope)
*   **The Discovery:** On the 21st day, Cooroo sees a **Morning Glory** vine growing out of a crack in the crystal wreckage of the Silver Wattle.
*   **The Parasite Paradox:** In the Old Ways, the Morning Glory was a "Resource Parasite"—a weed with no deep roots that stole water from the Wattle. But because it had no deep roots, it wasn't connected to the poisoned source. It survived.
*   **The Trellis:** Now, the "Parasite" is the only thing keeping the host's memory alive. It uses the shattered quartz-like wood as a trellis, threading its hair-thin roots into the **Compassion Gaps** (micro-fissures) to drink the last drops of the Wattle's life.
*   **The Colour:** The flower is **Lilac**—the colour of the Hún Nico sky during the "Pause." Cooroo realizes that "Blue, squeezed hard enough, turns Lilac." The vine has concentrated the sky into a bloom.

### Beat 5: The Voice
*   **The Signal:** The vine is not just a plant; it is an antenna. Because it is rooted in the Silver Wattle’s dead capillaries, it acts like a needle on a record player, picking up a faint vibration from the deep South-East that the dead tree can no longer process.
*   **The Direction:** The signal points to a **Great Jacaranda**—a tree with a violet bloom, growing in the "Lone Borow" territory where the map ends.
*   **The Mission:** Cooroo realizes his purpose. He must physically uproot the Morning Glory—the last living vessel of the Silver Wattle's memory—and carry it across the heart-world to the Jacaranda. This is the **Act of Transfer**: passing the lineage and memory of the dead host to the new prophet tree.
*   **The Scream:** He screams—a raw, ugly, beautiful noise that fills the silence.
*   **The Response:** The sound is so "un-perfect" that it cracks Cooriki’s internal sanctuary. She turns her head. It is enough. Cooroo prepares to fly, the lilac vine gripped in his claws.
