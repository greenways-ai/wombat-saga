# Beat 05: The Violet Invasion (The Warlord Track)

**Context:** These beats are the "Forensic Filler" for `02-cooroos_journey.md`, adjusted to reflect the **Warring Emu Tribes** (Honor/Aggression) and the **Jacaranda's Invasive Nature**.

---

## Beat 1: The Calorie Calculus (The Steelman)
**The Void:** The text portrays Wedgies as "Boring Killers."
**The Reality:** They are "Starving Logicians."

*   **The Context:** The Crystal World has no loose biomass. The "Static" has tiled over the food chain.
*   **The Scene:** As the Notched Eagle approaches, Cooroo sees the skeletal ridge beneath its feathers. The "Geometric Vector" isn't arrogance; it's **Famine Protocol**. Every flap of a wing costs calories they can't replace.
*   **The Shift:** They aren't trying to delete Cooroo because they hate "mess." They are trying to delete him because he represents 400 calories and they are running on 1%. The "Perfect Geometry" is energy conservation carried to a lethal extreme.

## Beat 2: The Warlord's Spite (The Warring Tribes)
**The Void:** The Emu saves Cooroo for no reason (The "Magical Helper" problem).
**The Reality:** The Emu uses Cooroo to humiliate the Eagles.

*   **The Lore:** The Emus are **Warring Tribes**. They fight amongst themselves for territory and honor on the Steppe. They despise the Wedgies not because they fly, but because they are "Sky-Scavengers" who refuse to engage in honorable combat.
*   **The Encounter:** The Emu (likely a Ronin or a scout from a specific clan) sees the three Wedgies hunting a pathetic, flightless Galah. It offends the Emu's sense of scale. "Three Eagles for one puff-ball? Cowardice."
*   **The Act:** The Emu doesn't bow. It barely slows down. It barks a command: *Mount or Die.*
*   **The Motivation:** The Emu isn't saving Cooroo. It is **denying the kill** to the Eagles out of pure spite. It treats Cooroo not as a guest, but as a **War Banner**.
*   **The Ride:** The Emu runs *at* the shadows of the Eagles, daring them to dive. It uses Cooroo as live bait to prove the Eagles are too cowardly to engage a ground-target. "Hold the vine up. If you drop it, I eat you."

## Beat 3: The Pot-Bound God (The Jacaranda's Origin)
**The Void:** The Jacaranda is presented as a "Miracle" without origin.
**The Reality:** It is an "Invasive Ornamental" (The False King).

*   **The Clue:** When Cooroo lands in the Violet Zone, he notices the roots. They don't go down into the deep substrate (where the Wattle went). They spiral outward, circling themselves.
* **The Reveal:** This is "Pot-Bound" root behavior. The Jacaranda isn't a native God-Tree. It's a **transplant**. A Garden Escapee from the Tall-Ones' dreaming. It was designed for a pot, for aesthetics, for "curb appeal."
*   **The Irony:** It survived the Crystal *because* it is shallow. It doesn't need the deep earth; it only needs surface water and attention.
*   **The Trade:** Cooroo realizes he is grafting the sacred memory of the Wattle onto a "Pretty Stranger." He isn't saving the kingdom with a true heir; he is installing a puppet king because it's the only thing green enough to hold the crown. The Jacaranda is the "Beautiful Lie" that saves the world from the "Ugly Truth" (The Static).

## Summary of Integration
1.  **Wedgies:** Desperate starvation drives their math.
2.  **Emus:** Arrogant Warlords using Cooroo as a banner to spite the cowardly Eagles.
3.  **Jacaranda:** An invasive, pot-bound "False King" that Cooroo accepts because it's the only green thing left.
