# Beat 03: The Architect and the Catalyst (Hoebat and Lolaboo)

**Title:** The Melborow Frequency
**Perspective:** Hoebat / Lolaboo

---

### Beat 1: The Dead Zone (Gray Grotto Inspection)
*   **The Setting:** The rain-soaked alleyways of the **Gray Grotto**. The air smells of "wet asphalt and neglected drainage."
*   **The Characters:** **Hoebat** (The Worker) and his gf **Lolaboo**. Lolaboo is using a "BorowFinder" app, but the signal is weak.
*   **The Observation:** The streetlights are smashed. Hoebat recognizes this as intentional neglect by the Council to create a "Dead Zone."
*   **The Blackout:** The city hum dies. The digital map vanishes. They are left in the ink-black reality of the Grotto.

### Beat 2: The Scavengers (The Shadow in the Rain)
*   **The Threat:** Three **Lost Dingoes** (Scavengers) emerge from a collapsed drain. They are rib-thin and hungry, disconnected from the Pack Code.
*   **The Crisis:** They circle Hoebat and Lolaboo. The lead scavenger sees them as "Soft-Paws" from the upper levels—easy prey.
*   **The Invocation:** Hoebat doesn't fight. He drops his center of gravity (**Symmetry**) and emits the **Watcher's Frequency**—a rhythmic clicking sound taught to him by Uncle Hangbat.
*   **The Password:** He speaks the Dingo-Tongue: *"The bone is dry. The marrow is gone. I am the Living Root, not the Dead Branch."*

### Beat 3: The Recognition (Pokero's Intervention)
*   **The Savior:** **Pokero** steps from the shadows. He is the Alpha of the urban pack. He recognizes the code.
*   **The Command:** Pokero yelps, and the scavengers scatter.
*   **The Dialogue:** Pokero mocks Hoebat for being in the "graveyard" of the Grotto. He warns that the district is "rotting from the inside out."
*   **The Warning:** Pokero points to the **Great Retaining Wall**: "Walls just make the rot smell worse. If you want a hole that won't cave in, look where the Dingoes *don't* hunt."

### Beat 4: The Realization (Dead Tissue)
*   **The Aftermath:** The power flickers back on. The sickly yellow streetlights return.
*   **The Shift:** Lolaboo is stunned by Hoebat's hidden knowledge.
*   **The Philosophy:** Hoebat explains: "The High-Noses teach us the world is math. The Dingoes know it's a song. If you forget the lyrics, they eat you."
*   **The Decision:** They abandon the Gray Grotto inspection. Hoebat realizes the entire district is **Dead Tissue** (**Section 3.1**). They need to find soil that is "still breathing"—the illegal, unmapped tunnels where the roots still hold the ceiling.

**[TIME JUMP: The Great Dispersion]**

### Beat 5: The Missionary's Failure (The Resistance)
*   **The Context:** Years have passed. Hoebat has been inducted into the **Kappa Mu** (Lambda Squad) along with Bash, Merl, Cooroo, and Pokero. 
*   **The Mission:** The squad was tasked by the Great Jacaranda to return to their respective societies and spread the **Mahatahto**—the message of "Width over Depth" and the "Rule of the New."
*   **The Effort:** While the others have found varying success in their domains (Cooroo in the high perches, Pokero in the Static-Unit), **Hoebat** has failed to move the Wombat mainstream.
*   **The Barrier:** Melborow is too "calcified." The Wombat society is addicted to the **Vertical Doctrine** and the perceived safety of **Safety Grout**. 
*   **The Rejection:** When Hoebat tried to "speak the truth" to the Council and the Lo-Snout workers, he was mocked as a "Hippie Dreamer" and a threat to urban stability. They chose the "Safety of the Ledger" over the "Chaos of the Root."
*   **The Isolation:** Because his message was rejected, Hoebat is forced back into the shadows. He continues his work in the dark, repairing the world in secret because the world won't let him save it in the light. He is the most isolated member of the squad, burdened by the weight of a roof that refuses to admit it's falling.
