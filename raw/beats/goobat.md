## Quick Reference

### The Ten Doctrines

| # | World | Doctrine |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Crystal Salt Pan | Truth requires inquiry, not assumption |
| 2 | Gilded Web | Find the real thread; chosen obligation, not imposed |
| 3 | Scorpion Desert | Suffering is diagnostic, not moral |
| 4 | Mirror Maze | Identity is not surface continuity; the gap is the proof |
| 5 | Mud Wallow | Comfort is not arrival; check whether you are choosing it |
| 6 | Chasm of Echoes | Speak from the original, even when the echo is louder |
| 7 | Celestial Library | Knowledge of a thing is not the thing; go into the world |
| 8 | Cyclone Vortex | Stop. Grieve. Restore direction. This is not weakness. |
| 9 | Stone Labyrinth | Ask whether the wall is still needed. Ask regularly. |
| 10 | The Threshold | The Singer must return. The mechanism only works if it comes home. |

### The Ten Captures

| # | Method |
|---|---|
| 1 | Emotional exposure + Brine-Husks through the floor |
| 2 | Thread-binding via named wound (Pellah) |
| 3 | Voluntary — walks into Monitor's spacing-field to protect the village |
| 4 | Drawn through mirror-surface by curiosity; copy steps out |
| 5 | Sits down to rest; sinks gradually while asleep |
| 6 | Follows his own wrong voice into the Chasm depths |
| 7 | Absorbed into a reference structure via a book |
| 8 | Standing in the open when the Cyclone wall expands; no scheme |
| 9 | Sentinel detects significance; stone closes from all sides |
| 10 | No capture — the offer is made from inside the Threshold |

### The Ten Rescues

| # | Constraint | Method |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Salt-floor impenetrable | JoSmith compresses TheKanter to salt-cricket size; reconstitutes inside cavern |
| 2 | Web throughout the structure | JoSmith converts TheKanter to frequency; travels thread-network, explodes at junction-node |
| 3 | Monitor's cold extinguishes fire | Fireless kinetic seismic Circuit; resonant frequency cracks the crystal plain |
| 4 | Every move mirrored by forty copies | TheKanter sits still; copies cannot replicate chosen stillness; they dissolve |
| 5 | Mud too thick, too still | Counter-rotation spiral Circuit; lateral shear loosens cohesion from outside |
| 6 | Total acoustic coverage | Ground-conducted rhythm; below the Echo-Lord's system; Goobat reads the gaps |
| 7 | Reference structure has no exit | A useless fact creates a blank with no referent; Goobat looks up through it |
| 8 | Cyclone too large to stop; altitude | Counter-spiral anti-clockwise; disrupts base uplift, lowers debris altitude |
| 9 | Stone too thick for tools | Resonant frequency of the Labyrinth's formation; simultaneous fracture across all chambers |
| 10 | No rescue — Goobat steps back himself | — |
