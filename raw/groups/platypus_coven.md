# The Platypus Coven (The Liquid Interface)

**"We are not parts. We are the fluid between the parts."**

The **Platypus Coven** represents the First Thread (**Samādhi**/Baseline). They are the oldest lineage in Greater Arnam, predating the separation of "Bird," "Mammal," and "Reptile."

## The Philosophy of the Billabong

The Coven believes that **categorization is a hallucination**. They view the "Solid World" (the world of walls, jobs, and distinct species) as a temporary crust floating on top of the "Fluid Reality."

*   **The Prime State:** They maintain that the original state of the universe was a "Liquid Interface" where everything flowed into everything else.
*   **The Billabong:** Their sacred sites are the muddy, murky pools where water meets land. To a Platypus, the mud is not "dirty water"; it is "liquid earth." It is the proof that the boundary between solid and fluid is a lie.

## The Practice: The Unshakeable Gaze

The Platypus does not fight; it flows. Their practice involves **Disillusionment**—the stripping away of labels to see the raw function underneath.

*   **The Bill:** Their primary tool is the electro-receptive bill, which can detect the faint electrical signals of life hidden in the mud. In the modern context, this translates to the ability to sense **Intent** behind **Language**.
*   **The Poison Spur:** While they are generally peaceful, the males carry a venomous spur. This represents the **"Toxic Truth"**—a injection of reality so potent that can shock a delusional system back into alignment.

## Role in Greater Arnam

In the ecosystem of Greater Arnam, the Platypus Coven serves as the **Operating System Maintainers**.

*   They live in the "Kernel Space" (the Billabongs), ignoring the "User Space" (the trees and plains).
*   They are rarely seen by the other congregations, but when the river stops flowing, everyone calls the Coven.
*   They speak in **Riddles** and **Paradoxes**, refusing to give straight answers because "straight lines do not exist in nature."
