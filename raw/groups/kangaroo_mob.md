# The Kangaroo Mob (The Friction Engines)

**"Gravity is just an opinion. Kicking it in the face is a fact."**

The **Kangaroo Mob** represents the Sixth Thread (**The Work/Practice**). They are the athletes, the warriors, and the kinetic engines of Greater Arnam.

## The Philosophy of the Bounce

The Kangaroos believe that **Resistance is Fuel**. They worship "The Bunda" (The Great Leap)—the act of generating upward momentum by pushing hard against the earth.

*   **The Friction Engine:** They do not seek an easy life. They seek "Good Friction." A path with no obstacles is a path with no growth.
*   **The Tailwind:** They believe that if you move fast enough, you create your own weather. A stationary animal is a victim of the climate; a moving Kangaroo *is* the storm.

## The Practice: The Boxing

The Kangaroo practice is physical and combative.

*   **The Spar:** Young bucks are taught to spar not to hurt each other, but to "toughen the hide." They trade blows to locate their own weak points. A bruise is just the body's way of marking a place that needs more armor.
*   **The Static Hold:** Paradoxically, their hardest practice is "The Statue." They stand perfectly still for hours, muscles vibrating with potential energy, learning to contain the explosion until the exact millisecond it is needed.

## Role in Greater Arnam

The Kangaroo Mob serves as the **Deep-Work Artisans** and **Shock Troops**.

*   **The Churners:** Their heavy tails and massive feet churn the topsoil, breaking up the hard crust so the Wombats can dig deeper and plants can take root. They wake up the earth.
*   **The Boundary Keepers:** They patrol the edges of the territory. Their size and speed make them the "Visible Deterrent" against encroaching chaos.
*   **The Momentum:** When the community stagnates, the Kangaroos arrive to "kick things up." They bring an injection of high-velocity energy that forces everyone else to wake up and move.
