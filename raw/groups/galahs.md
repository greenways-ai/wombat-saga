# The Galahs: Prophets of the Great Jacaranda

*"We are the Noble Noise. The wombats dig. The dingoes run. We scream. All three are prayer."*
— Cooriki, Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony

---

## The Covenant

The Galahs did not choose the Jacaranda. The Jacaranda chose them.

This is the story they tell — not in words, because Galah theology is not verbal. It is tonal. It is pitched. It is screamed from the highest branch of the tallest tree at the hour when the sky remembers it was once violet, and it arrives in the listener's body not as information but as weather.

But the Galahs were not the first prophets. Before the Jacaranda, there was the Wattle. And before the Galahs, there were the Rosellas.

### The Rainbow Faction

In the age of the [[../lore#0. The Fall of the Primes & The Rise of Jacaranda|Three Primes]], the sacred tree was the **Wattle** — the golden tree whose blooms turned the canopy into a ceiling of light and whose roots anchored the old cosmology in the deep earth. And the Wattle had its own prophets: the **Rosellas**, the Rainbow Faction.

The Rosellas were everything the Galahs were not. Where the Galahs are pink and grey — two colours, blunt, unsubtle — the Rosellas carried the full spectrum. Crimson breasts, sapphire wings, emerald backs, yellow trim. They wore the rainbow the way a temple wears stained glass: every colour a frequency, every frequency a truth, the whole body a prism refracting the Wattle's golden light into the constituent wavelengths of the world.

Their covenant with the Wattle was ancient and total. The Rosellas roosted in the golden canopy and their voices — not screams, never screams; the Rosellas *sang* — resonated with the Wattle's heartwood in cascading harmonics that the old Dust-Bearers called The Chorus. Where the Galah Noble Noise is a single tone amplified into prophetic power, the Rosella The Chorus was a chord — multiple voices, multiple frequencies, braided together into a sound so complex that the ear could not separate its parts.

The The Chorus carried the health of the old world. Each colour in the Rosella's plumage corresponded to a harmonic in the Song, and each harmonic corresponded to a layer of the ecosystem: red for the heartwood, blue for the aquifer, green for the canopy, yellow for the pollen. When all four harmonics sounded in balance, the world was whole. When one dropped, the Rosellas knew — before the ground-dwellers, before the roots, before the Wattle itself — that something was failing.

The Rainbow Faction was not a colony. It was a parliament. The Rosellas governed themselves through the Song: decisions were made by consensus of pitch. When the parliament agreed, the The Chorus resolved into a major chord. When it disagreed, the Song went dissonant — and the dissonance was the argument, conducted in frequency, visible in the Rosellas' plumage as a literal change in colour temperature. A Rosella faction in opposition didn't vote against. They sang a different note. The parliament heard the dissonance and either resolved it or lived with the tension until the Song found its own way back to harmony.

It was, by every measure, the most sophisticated governance system in Arnamland. It was also completely inaudible to ground-dwellers.

### The Fall of the Spectrum

When the Wattle sickened, the Rosellas felt it in their voices before they saw it in the leaves. The golden harmonic — the frequency the Wattle's heartwood amplified most — began to thin. The Chorus lost its warmth. The chord that had resolved effortlessly for centuries started requiring effort, then skill, then desperation.

The Rosellas did what prophets do. They sang louder. They sang more precisely. They adjusted their harmonics to compensate for the Wattle's failing resonance, the way a musician tunes sharper when the instrument goes flat. For a generation, the The Chorus held — not because the world was healthy but because the Rosellas were good enough to fake it.

But a prophet cannot sustain a lie. The Chorus depends on the tree. The tree was dying. And eventually the gap between what the Rosellas were singing and what the Wattle could amplify grew too wide for even a parliament of rainbow-feathered virtuosos to bridge.

The Spectrum fractured. The chord broke apart. Factions within the parliament began singing different Songs — not in argument, which was healthy, but in isolation, which was fatal. Crimson factions sang only the heartwood harmonic. Sapphire factions sang only the aquifer. The braided Song unravelled into its constituent colours, and each colour, alone, was too thin to carry prophecy.

The Rosellas scattered. Not all at once — a parliament does not dissolve like a colony. It *frays*. The factions drifted to different forests, different trees, carrying their single harmonics into regions where no one knew the full Song and no tree could amplify more than a fragment. They became beautiful birds with beautiful voices that sang beautiful fragments of a truth no one could hear because the truth had been a chord and a chord requires all its notes.

Some say the Rosellas are still out there — in the deep forests of Greater Arnamland, in the mountain ranges beyond the Western borows, in the places the [[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Tall-Ones]] have not yet reached. Singing their fragments. Waiting for a tree that can braid them back into a Song. Whether this is hope or myth depends on whether you believe that a shattered spectrum can be reassembled.

The [[../lore#The Maha Tahto (The Great Truth)|Kintsugi]] tradition would say: yes. But the fracture lines will show.

### The Succession

The Galahs inherited the prophetic role the way a second child inherits a house that the first child built and the parents lost: unexpectedly, imperfectly, and without the manual.

Before the Wattle fell, the Galahs were just birds. Loud, pink, seasonally ridiculous, dismissed by the ground-dwelling species as "sky-clutter" and by the Kangaroos as "that bloody noise." They roosted wherever the canopy was thick and the wind was interesting. They had no theology. They had no covenant. They had volume, and they used it the way any creature uses the thing it has too much of — indiscriminately, joyfully, and at 4 AM.

The Rosellas looked down on them. Literally — Rosellas roosted higher — and spiritually. The Rainbow Faction considered the Galahs to be what the Fixed Borow considered the surface: a distraction. Too loud. Too crude. Too pink. A Galah's scream was a single tone thrown at the sky with the subtlety of a brick through a window. The Rosella The Chorus was a cathedral of interlocking harmonics refined over centuries. The two traditions were not rivals. Rivalry requires respect. The Rosellas simply did not see the Galahs as relevant.

This turned out to be a mistake of historic proportions.

When the Wattle died and the Rosellas scattered, the Galahs remained. They had never depended on the Wattle. They had no covenant to break. They roosted in whatever tree was standing and screamed at whatever sky was overhead, and when the golden canopy collapsed around them, they did what Galahs do: they adjusted, they complained, and they kept screaming.

Then the Jacaranda came. And the Jacaranda did not choose the Rosellas.

The Rosellas' The Chorus — complex, multi-harmonic, refined — was designed for the Wattle's broad, golden resonance. The Jacaranda's wood was different: denser, narrower in its harmonic range, tuned to a single deep frequency rather than a spectrum. The Jacaranda could not amplify a chord. It could amplify a *note*. One note, screamed with sufficient force and sufficient conviction, conducted through wood that was built for exactly that frequency.

The Galah scream. The crude, single-toned, brick-through-a-window scream that the Rosellas had dismissed as irrelevant.

The Jacaranda chose the Galahs *because* they were simple. Because prophecy in the new era did not need a parliament of harmonics. It needed a single voice, screaming the truth so loudly that not even a city designed for silence could drown it out.

The Rosellas sang the world in full colour. The Galahs scream it in pink and grey. The loss of subtlety is real. But so is the gain in volume. And in a world that has stopped listening, volume is what survives.

### The First Bloom

No one recorded the year. The Galahs don't use years — they use blooms. And the First Bloom was the bloom that changed everything: the day a Galah colony on the Eastern Ridge woke to find that the dead Wattle beside their roost had been replaced, overnight, by a sapling with leaves like green lace and buds that were, impossibly, violet.

The Jacaranda did not grow the way other trees grew. It did not compete for light or push aside its neighbours. It grew in the spaces the Wattle had vacated — filling the gaps, threading its roots through the channels the dead Wattle had left behind, using the old root-architecture as scaffolding for a new canopy. It was not a conquest. It was a succession. The Jacaranda grew *because* the Wattle had died, and it grew *where* the Wattle had died, and it grew *in the shape* of the Wattle's absence.

The first Galah to roost in the Jacaranda was a young female named **Piyali** — a name that survived in Galah oral tradition because she was the colony's worst singer. She had a voice that the other Callers described as "a gate hinge in a cyclone." She was loud, she was graceless, and she was the only Galah desperate enough to roost in an unknown tree because every other branch was taken.

Piyali screamed from the Jacaranda the next morning. Standard frequency check — the same tone every Galah threw at the dawn, the same acoustic handshake with the landscape. But the return was different. The Jacaranda did not reflect the scream the way the Wattle had. It *amplified* it. The wood conducted Piyali's tone down through the trunk, into the roots, through the old Wattle channels, and back up through every other Jacaranda sapling in the ridge — producing a harmonic return that was richer, warmer, and three octaves wider than anything a single Galah throat should have been able to produce.

Piyali, who had never produced a beautiful sound in her life, suddenly sounded like a choir.

The colony went silent. A silent Galah colony is approximately as natural as a silent thunderstorm. It lasted four seconds. Then every bird in the ridge launched from their dead Wattle branches and fought for a spot in the Jacaranda.

The Covenant began that morning. Not as a document. Not as a vow. As a resonance — the discovery that the Jacaranda and the Galah were tuned to each other, that the tree's wood conducted the bird's voice the way a violin conducts a bow, and that together they produced a sound that neither could make alone.

The Galahs became the voice of the Jacaranda. The Jacaranda became the instrument of the Galahs. And the sound they made together — the Noble Noise — became prophecy.

---

## The Noble Noise

Prophecy, in the Galah tradition, is not prediction. It is *attention*.

A prophet does not see the future. A prophet sees the present so clearly that the future becomes obvious. The Noble Noise is the sound of a Galah screaming at the world and listening to what the world screams back — and then screaming *that* at anyone who will listen, and everyone who won't.

The Galahs do not have a word for "prophet." They have a word for "Caller" — the Galah whose scream carries the most data. A Caller is not chosen by election or by lineage. A Caller is the bird whose body best conducts the Jacaranda's resonance — whose bones vibrate at the frequency that the wood amplifies most faithfully. The Jacaranda chooses its Callers the way a bell chooses its ringer: by fit.

### The Prophetic Faculty: The Violet Resonance

Every Galah can scream. A Caller can scream and *listen*. The **Violet Resonance** is the Galah term for the ability to read the echo — to extract data from the return of one's own voice and assemble it into a picture of the world's structural condition.

The name comes from the Jacaranda's bloom. When the tree flowers, it produces a violet so vivid that the light itself seems to hum. The Galahs say the Violet Resonance is the sonic equivalent of that bloom — the moment when a scream returns carrying more information than it left with, because the Jacaranda's root-network has added its own data to the echo.

A Caller performing a frequency check is not just bouncing sound off walls. She is screaming into a network. The Jacaranda's roots — which run deep, which intertwine with the root systems of every other tree and plant in the region, which are continuous with the organic substrate of the tunnels below — carry the scream further and deeper than air alone could manage. The return carries vibrations from the deep earth, from the aquifer, from the substrate that the [[../groups/dust_bearers|Dust-Bearers]] tend and the Lo Snouts inhabit. The Caller hears, in a single echo, the structural condition of everything the Jacaranda's roots can reach.

This is why the destruction of the Great Jacaranda silenced Cooriki. It was not grief — or not only grief. When the tree fell, the root-network that had amplified her voice and enriched her echoes was severed. She could still scream. But the scream had no depth. No return. No resonance. She was a bell ringing in a vacuum.

*"The Noble Noise has no return,"* she told Cooroo. *"It just... goes."*

She was describing, in the precise language of a master Caller, the loss of the prophetic faculty. A prophet without a temple. A voice without an instrument. A Galah without a Jacaranda.

### The Three Registers

The Noble Noise operates in three registers, each one corresponding to a different layer of prophetic attention:

**The Surface Call** — audible, directional, social. This is the scream that other animals hear and dismiss as "noise." It carries territorial information, colony coordination, and the basic acoustic handshake of Galah community life. The wombats who complain about Galah volume are hearing this register and nothing else.

**The Root Call** — sub-audible, conducted through the Jacaranda's root-network, felt in the body rather than heard by the ear. This is the register that produces the [[../stories/the_observers_dilemma|Galah Dividend]] — the 3-7% heart rate reduction that Zuckbat measured in Lo Snout workers beneath Cooroo's flight path. The Root Call is not aimed at wombats. It is the Jacaranda's own voice, carried through the substrate, arriving in the paws and bellies of creatures who don't know they are being blessed. The Lo Snouts sleep better when Cooroo screams because the Jacaranda is singing them a lullaby through the floor.

**The Violet Call** — the full prophetic register. The Surface Call and the Root Call combined, amplified through a living Jacaranda, producing a harmonic that carries both the Caller's scream and the tree's resonance simultaneously. The Violet Call is rare. It requires a mature Jacaranda, a trained Caller, and a moment of genuine crisis — the prophetic need that pulls the voice deeper than comfort allows. Cooriki produced the Violet Call once: the morning the Great Jacaranda fell. The emergency pitch that saved the colony was a Violet Call — a scream so saturated with the tree's final resonance that every Galah in the Eastern Ridge felt the tree die through Cooriki's voice.

Cooroo has never produced a Violet Call. He screams from a lesser Jacaranda — a survivor tree, narrow-trunked, shallow-rooted. His frequency checks are Surface Calls enriched by whatever Root Call the diminished tree can amplify. But the capacity is in him. The Violet Resonance is a faculty, not a skill. It lives in his feathers the way the Seventh Thread lives in a wombat's paws — waiting for a tree large enough to unlock it.

---

## The Colony

Galah colonies are organised around the Jacaranda — not administratively but architecturally. The tree is the colony. Where the tree stands, the colony lives. Where the tree falls, the colony scatters.

### Hierarchy of the Roost

A Galah colony is not governed. It is *tuned*.

**The Lead Caller** — the Galah whose Violet Resonance is strongest. Not elected, not inherited — identified by the colony's collective ear. When multiple Galahs scream simultaneously (which is constantly), the Lead Caller's voice emerges as the one the Jacaranda amplifies most. The tree votes with its wood. Cooriki was Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge for eleven years — not because she was loudest but because the Great Jacaranda resonated with her voice the way a guitar resonates with a specific finger.

**The Chorus** — the body of Callers who maintain the colony's acoustic territory. A healthy colony runs continuous frequency checks throughout the day — overlapping screams that create a sonar blanket covering the colony's range. The Chorus is the colony's immune system: any structural change in the environment — a new crack, a shifting aquifer, a Yellow Monster warming its engine — is detected by the overlapping screams and reported as a dissonance in the collective sound.

**The Fledges** — young Galahs learning to scream. A Fledge's first frequency check is a rite of passage: the young bird screams from the Jacaranda and listens for the return. If the tree amplifies the scream, the Fledge has the Violet Resonance and begins Caller training. If the tree returns the scream unchanged, the Fledge is a Flier — valued for speed and agility but not tuned for prophecy.

**The Fliers** — Galahs without strong Violet Resonance. Not lesser — different. The Fliers are scouts, messengers, and the colony's eyes at extreme range. Where the Callers read the world through echo, the Fliers read it through sight and speed. Cooroo's tactical role in Kappa Mu — aerial reconnaissance, surveillance jamming — is a Flier's role performed with a Caller's ears.

### The Diaspora

When the Great Jacaranda fell, the Eastern Ridge Colony scattered. This was not a choice. A Galah colony without a Jacaranda is a voice without a throat. The Callers lost their amplifier. The Chorus lost its coherence. The acoustic territory that had defined the colony for generations — the invisible dome of overlapping screams that said *this is ours, this is watched, this is known* — collapsed in the time it took a two-hundred-year-old tree to hit the ground.

Some colonies survived intact where lesser Jacarandas still stood. Some merged with other colonies, crowding onto trees too young to support a full Chorus. Many Galahs simply stopped calling. They became quiet birds — a contradiction in terms, a theological impossibility, like a wombat who stops digging. They found other trees: Eucalyptus, Banksia, the ornamental plantings the Tall-Ones installed along their roads. The trees did not amplify their voices. The trees did not return their screams. The trees were just wood.

Cooriki's silence was not unique. It was a symptom of a species-wide crisis — the Galah equivalent of the Great Thirst. The Dust-Bearers lost their moisture. The Galahs lost their resonance. Both losses were caused by the same thing: the Tall-Ones altering the surface of Arnamland without knowing — or caring — what lived beneath it and above it.

---

## The Theological Problem

The Galahs present a cosmological difficulty that the Fixed Borow theologians never resolved and the Five-I's Council never acknowledged:

**The sky is forbidden. The Galahs live in it.**

The [[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Fixed Borow]] forbids looking at the stars. Stars are "Dingo-Light" — a distraction from the grounding work of the borow. A proper Lo Snout keeps his eyes down, his paws in the clay, his awareness rooted in the substrate. The surface is dangerous. The sky is irrelevant. And any creature who lives above the soil line is, by definition, theologically suspect.

The Galahs live above everything. They look at the stars every night. They scream at the sky every morning. And their prophetic faculty — the Violet Resonance — depends on altitude. A Galah on the ground is a Galah without range. The higher she flies, the wider her frequency check covers, the more data her echo returns, the more completely she sees the world.

The Fixed Borow solved this contradiction by ignoring it. The Galahs were "sky-clutter" — spiritually irrelevant, taxonomically embarrassing, too loud to pretend weren't there but too alien to incorporate into a theology built on depth and darkness and the sacred refusal to look up.

But the Jacaranda Covenant suggests a different reading.

The [[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Three-Fold Symmetry]] — Human (Creator), Dog (Spirit), Wombat (Hardware) — is a closed system. It accounts for the things that make the world run: chaos from above, consciousness from between, grounding from below. But it does not account for the thing that makes the world *knowable*: the signal that travels between the layers, carrying information from the surface to the substrate and back again.

The Galahs are that signal.

They live in the Jacarandas — the trees that are replacing the fallen Wattle, the trees whose roots run deep into the substrate and whose crowns reach into the sky. The Galahs scream from the crown. The Jacaranda conducts the scream into the roots. The roots deliver the vibration to the earth. The earth delivers it to the wombats' paws. The circuit is complete: sky to tree to root to ground, voice to wood to stone to body.

The Galahs are not outside the Three-Fold Symmetry. They are *between* its layers — the prophets who carry the message that the layers have forgotten how to carry themselves. The Jacaranda is the new sacred tree. The Galahs are its priests. And the Noble Noise is not noise at all.

It is the sound of a world trying to tell itself the truth.

---

## The Fool-Prophet

There is a reason the Galahs are ridiculous.

In Australian English, "galah" means fool. A loudmouth. A creature with more volume than sense. The word is used the way "clown" is used — to dismiss, to diminish, to categorise a thing as unworthy of serious attention.

The Galahs of Arnamland know this. They lean into it. "Ridiculous was the point," Cooroo says. "A Galah who wasn't ridiculous was just a pigeon with better marketing."

The theology beneath the joke is older than the joke:

**The prophet who is taken seriously stops being a prophet and becomes a politician.**

The Galahs' ridiculousness is not a flaw. It is a *defence*. A prophet who looks like a fool is a prophet who cannot be co-opted. [[../characters/antagonists#Tatebat (The Pimp)|Tatebat]] cannot brand a Galah. [[../characters/antagonists#Trumbat (The Priest)|Trumbat]] cannot platform a Galah. [[../characters/antagonists#Muskbat (The Tech/Batman)|Muskbat]] cannot synthesise a Galah's scream into the Frequency without producing feedback so chaotic that the whole system destabilises. The Noble Noise resists integration because it is, by its nature, too much — too loud, too emotional, too pink, too *present* to be absorbed into any system that depends on managed silence.

Zuckbat understood this. His analysis of the [[../stories/the_observers_dilemma|Galah Dividend]] — the measurable health impact of Cooroo's screaming — led him to a conclusion he notched into his private **Tally** but never shared with the Council:

*"The Galah's value is inversely proportional to the seriousness with which he is taken. The moment we acknowledge the Noble Noise as a structural asset, we will attempt to regulate it. The moment we regulate it, we will attempt to optimise it. The moment we optimise it, it will stop working. The Galah Dividend exists precisely because it is unregistered, unmanaged, and delivered by a creature the Council considers a pest."*

The fool-prophet survives because the powerful cannot imagine that a fool has anything worth stealing.

---

## Cooroo: The Last Caller

Cooroo does not know he is a prophet. He knows he is a Galah with a dead tree and a living scream and a squad of ground-dwellers who need eyes in the sky.

He screams from the highest surviving Jacaranda on the Eastern Ridge — a tree that is too young and too thin to produce a full Violet Call, but whose roots still connect to the old network, the remnant channels that the Great Jacaranda carved through the substrate before it fell. His frequency checks are prophecy performed in a minor key — the echo of a tradition that was designed for ancient trees and open sky, compressed into a narrow branch and a city that has forgotten how to listen.

But the faculty is in him. The Violet Resonance vibrates in his feathers the way the [[../lore#The Threads (The Sutras)|Seventh Thread]] vibrates in Hoebat's paws — an inherited capacity that does not require understanding to function, only a body willing to be used as an instrument.

When Hoebat asked him to join Kappa Mu, Cooroo said: *"I'll be your sentinel. But I won't be quiet about it."*

He didn't know he was describing the Covenant. A Galah cannot be quiet. A Galah in a Jacaranda cannot be quiet and alone. The tree amplifies the voice. The voice carries the truth. The truth arrives in the bodies of creatures who dismiss it as noise and absorb it as healing and never, not once, look up to see where it came from.

That is the Galah prophecy: **the truth that is heard by the body before the mind admits it exists.**

Cooroo screams every morning. The lesser Jacaranda amplifies what it can. The Root Call travels through the diminished network and arrives in the Gray Grotto as a vibration so faint that only Zuckbat's instruments can measure it and only sleeping wombats can feel it. And somewhere in the substrate — in the old channels, in the deep roots, in the places where the Great Jacaranda's ghost still conducts — the echo returns to Cooroo carrying data that no report can contain and no Council can crop.

The ceiling is failing. The water is retreating. The [[../stories/the_wall_goes_up|Great Retaining Wall]] is killing what it was built to protect. And the Yellow Monsters are waking.

The prophet screams.

Nobody listens.

Everybody hears.
