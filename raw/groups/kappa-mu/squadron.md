In that case, the mission profile for the **Kappa Mu** shifts from a simple chemical containment to a high-stakes ethical and structural intervention. If the Koalas—the traditionally high-altitude, "Arnam-sensitive" residents—are running a **Eucalyptus Lab**, it signifies a deep systemic corruption where the victims have become the overseers of their own "Great Crystalisation."

Here is how the team must operate to infiltrate and dismantle a Lab run by those who should be their allies:

### Mission: Operation "Cloud-Break" (The Lab Infiltration)

The Koalas have likely been radicalized by the **Melborow Frequency** or the **Cynicism Armor** sold by Tatebat, leading them to transactionalize the very essence of Arnam for profit or "Innovation."

* **Wombat (The Architect/Treasurer):**
* **The Role:** Identifies the structural load-bearing points of the lab's human-built "Safety Grout" foundations.
* **The Action:** He performs "Secret Repairs" in reverse, weakening the lab's base to allow the **Old Ways** of the deep earth to reclaim the site once the toxins are neutralized.


* **Wallaby (The Comms):**
* **The Role:** The "Agile Interface" capable of navigating the high-level conduits and "Scrub" areas of the lab.
* **The Action:** Infiltrates the comms-array to broadcast a "Maha Tahto" pulse, temporarily drowning out the **Muskbat Frequency** that is keeping the Koalas in a state of clinical detachment.


* **Emu (The Sword Master):**
* **The Role:** Long-range tactical coordinator who uses the **Ninth Thread** (Systems Logic) to predict the lab's defensive response.
* **The Action:** Neutralizes the Koalas' "Termite Squad" surveillance drones using high-speed, precision strikes, ensuring the team remains in the "Sacred Darkness" (Tamas).


* **Galah (The Lookout):**
* **The Role:** The aerial "Satellite View" that monitors the movement of the **Tall-Ones** who may be funding or observing the experiment.
* **The Action:** Provides a "Noble Noise" distraction—a chaotic aerial display that forces the Koalas to look away from their monitors and back at the natural sky.


* **Dingo (The Technician / The Agora):**
* **The Role:** The Master Technician and spiritual anchor of the group. Pokero projects himself into places where the signal is most dense and most loud — reading the Static the way a Dhal-Mu reads the aquifer. He is the Agora in the sense that he is self-complete in his own static pool, needing no external validation.
* **The Action:** Acts as the "Mirror," reflecting the Koalas' own lost "Noble Intent" back at them. By holding the **Infinite Yes**, the Dingo forces the Koalas to realize they have traded their "Song of the Mothers" for **Tally-credits** and **Tally-Debt cycles**.



### The Conflict: Breaking the "Structural Rigidity"

The primary obstacle isn't physical force, but the **"Metal-Rigidity"** of the Koalas' new bureaucratic mindset. The mission succeeds only if the **Kappa Mu** can perform a **"Golden Repair"** (Kintsugi), healing the fracture between the Koalas and the rest of Arnamland by filling their "Obsidian Fractures" with the gold of shared survival.
