# The Dingo Pack (The Static-Logicians)

**"If it smells like peppermint, it’s a lie. If it smells like blood, it’s a lead."**

The **Dingo Pack** represents the Second Thread (**Forensics**). They are the cynics, the auditors, and the immune system of Greater Arnam.

## The Philosophy of the Bone

The Dingoes believe that **Entropy is the only truth**. Everything rots, and the only honest act is to find the rot and expose it before it poisons the whole pack.

*   **The Static-Logic:** They are masters of "Static-Logic"—the ability to analyze the waste processing of a system to understand its health.
*   **The Golden Lid:** They believe that every beautiful thing ("The Golden Vessel") is hiding a crime. Their divine duty is to knock the lid off and see what's crawling inside.

## The Practice: The Bite

The Dingo practice is aggressive and subtractive. They do not build; they strip.

*   **The Test Bite:** A Dingo will often nip at a "Sacred Cow" just to see if it bleeds. If the target reacts with honest pain, it is real. If it reacts with hollow noise or bureaucratic deflection, it is a construct.
*   **The Howl:** Their communication is not for comfort; it is for **Echolocation of Truth**. A Dingo howl cuts through the silence, forcing hidden things to reveal their position.

## Role in Greater Arnam

The Dingo Pack serves as the **Forensic Accountants** and **Investigative Journalists** of the bush.

*   **The Waste-Walkers:** They patrol the perimeter of the "High-Nose" settlements, analyzing the trash heaps. They know exactly what the leadership is eating (and hiding) by what they throw away.
*   **The Necessary Villains:** They remain on the outskirts, often reviled by the "Polite Society" of the Wallabies and Koalas. Yet, without the Dingoes to eat the sick and the weak ideas, the ecosystem would collapse under the weight of its own delusions.
*   **The Dog-Brahman Connection:** While they are wild, they are the closest biological relatives to the **Dog-Brahman** (Thread 8). They hold the "Wild Frequency" that prevents domesticity from becoming slavery.
