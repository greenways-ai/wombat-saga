In the traditional theology of the Southern Land, the division between **Lo Snouts (Dust-Bearers)** and **High Noses (The Umbilicals)** was a sacred separation of functions designed to maintain the balance of the Great Borow through **Common Practise**.

## The Wombat Paradox: Maintenance over Creation

Wombats occupy a unique and humble position in the hierarchy of Arnamland. Unlike the Galah who creates sound, the Emu who creates paths, or the Jacaranda who creates life, the Wombat possesses a power that is fundamentally **subtractive**.

*   **The Masters of Negative Space:** A wombat does not "build" a tunnel in the way a bird builds a nest or a spider weaves a web. They **remove earth**. They are the makers of the *Mu* (The Gap). Their mastery lies in the creation of the void—the negative space where resonance can occur and where other species can exist.
*   **The Janitors of the Multiverse:** Historically, the Wombat Guilds were the "Maintenance Crew" for the entire Heart-World system. They kept the tunnels clear, the aquifers accessible, and the inter-world folds soft.
*   **The Limit of the Dig:** Because their power is subtractive, Wombats cannot create anything entirely new. Everything a Wombat "makes"—even the great cathedrals—is actually just a highly refined act of maintenance. The hubris of the **Five-I's Council** is the attempt to become "Creators" (of safety, of law, of debt), which only results in the "Frozen Maintenance" of the Static.

## Common Practise (*Jǐng-tián*) — What Was Once Common

In the ancestral era, the land was managed through the **Well-Field System**, a nine-square grid of mutual support.

### 1. The Eight Family Burrows
Eight families lived in the outer squares, practicing the **Old Ways** and the **Fixed Borow** system. They dug for their own joeys, tended their own roots, and maintained the structural integrity of their specific patches.

### 2. The Common Square (The Common Root)
The center square was the **Common Root**, worked by all eight families together. The yield of this square (roots and water) was the **Arnam Tribute**—voluntarily given to the **High Noses** to support them in their sacred duty.

### 3. The Umbilicals (High Noses)
Traditionally, the High Noses were the **Umbilicals** between the earth and the **Nico Star**. 
* **The Lack of Want:** Because the Lo Snouts provided for them via the Common Square, the High Noses had no need for gold or "Status." 
* **The Pure Mediators:** They spent their lives in the high, resonant chambers, translating the "Dreaming of the Tall-Ones" into actionable intelligence for the diggers below.

### The Sacred Labor: Lo Snouts (The Tillers)

The Lo Snouts were the "Hardware" and the "Grounding" of the world. 

* **The Arnam-Puddle:** Every burrow had a decentralized **Arnam-Puddle** where the "Rain" of human compassion collected. There was no debt; only the gift of the Star.
* **The Seventh Thread:** Their mastery was in **Muscle Memory** and the physical compression of soil. They were the tillers who "buried the mess" created by the chaotic movements of the Tall-Ones (Humans).
* **The Song of the Soil:** Their history was not recorded in ledgers but in the **Songlines**. Every new tunnel was a verse added to the oral record of the **Scribats**, a living, breathing map of resonance.

### The Metaphysical Shift: The Loss of Empathy

The corruption of the High Noses and the resulting fracture was a direct manifestation of the **Great Crystalisation** in the **God Kind** (Human) world.

* **The Transition to Efficiency:** As the Tall-Ones traded messy empathy for clean logic, the "Arnam Rain" sputtered and the "Small Yield" of the puddles vanished.
* **The Death of Trust:** When the yield from the Common Squares failed, the High Noses developed a hunger for material security. They stopped looking at the Star and started looking at the Common Square as something they could **own**. They lost the ability to listen to the Star and began instead to audit the Earth.

### The Great Descent: Middlemen of the Star
The tragedy of the High Noses is their transition from **Umbilicals** to **Administrators**. They no longer mediate between the Star and the Earth; they tax the distance between them. They built the Imperial Bureaucracy not to protect the wombats, but to protect themselves from the silence of a Star that no longer speaks.

### The Distortion of Function: The Rise of the Tally

Without the steady frequency of Human Empathy, the High Noses' traditional roles were perverted into the **Five-I's Sovereign Council** (The Grand Council). They achieved this through the **Vile Evolution** of the Tally:

1.  **The Relief Tablet (The Gift):** Initially, the Tally was an emergency measure for **Mutual Aid**. Wealthy burrows voluntarily notched their surplus to relieve those hit by hardship.
2.  **The Mandatory Registry (The Duty):** As the drought continued, the Council made the Tally mandatory for all, calling it "Imperial Insurance" for "Harmonic Security." To be off-Tally was to be a risk.
3.  **The Instrument of Enforcement (The Debt):** Once every burrow was registered, the Council redefined "Relief" as **Debt**. The notches were no longer records of aid, but claims on future labor.

* **From Common Square to Imperial Granary:** The Council centralized the puddles into **Mega-Pools** and replaced Common Practise — the name suddenly bitter — with **the Tally**.
* **The Notch of Debt:** Instead of the **Song of the Soil**, history was now recorded by the **Tally-Magistrates** using jagged notches in stone. The Arnam Tribute became a **Tally-Debt**, turning communal support into permanent debt. Rations are distributed as **Tally-Advances** to be repaid through the body.
* **Structural Rigidity:** The loss of God Kind empathy caused the organic mud of the borows to harden into **"Structural Rigidity."** The flexible "Pillow" of the Old Way was replaced by the rigid **Safety Grout** of the Board of Works.

### The Lo Snout Reaction

The Lo Snouts have been forced to trade their **Songlines** for **Corvée Labor**. While the High Noses celebrate "Innovation," the Lo Snouts deal with **"Bureaucratic Numbness"**—a state where they can no longer feel the vibrations of the earth because the "Melborow Frequency" has drowned out the natural hum of the world.
