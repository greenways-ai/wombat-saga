# Storyline of The Wombat Worlds Saga

This document maps the narrative arc of Hoebat, from his origins in Deep Arnamland to the looming collision in Melborow.

## 1. Origin: The Lineage of the "Old Ways"
Hoebat was born into a family of *Dust-Bearers* in Deep Arnamland. His parents adhered to the **"Fixed Borow"** system: stay where you are born, dig four feet deep, never look at the stars.

Hoebat’s rebellion began with **Section 2.4 (Temporal Cropping)**. His parents tried to "crop" his future to match their past. To avoid the suffocating "Root-Counting Homework," Hoebat ran away to the **Eucalyptus Groves**, where he met the **Hippie Wombats**. They taught him that "the breath is as important as the borow."

## 2. The Trials of Kappa Mu (The Initiation)
Hoebat didn't just stumble into his code; he earned it. He joined the **Initiation Class of the Greater Arnamland**.

*   **The Squad:** He formed **Kappa Mu** with Pokero (Dingo), Bash (Wallaby), Merl (Emu), and Cooroo (Galah).
*   **The Final Mission:** The squad had to navigate the **"Shattered Gorge"** without sight, relying entirely on the **Ninth Thread (Systems Logic)**—feeling vibrations to predict rockfalls.
*   **The Promise:** They swore the **Kappa Mu Oath**: *"To protect the Field when the Individual fails."*

## 3. The Encounter with the Wombokis
During his wanderings, Hoebat encountered the archetypes of the world:

*   **The Fortune Teller:** A blind bandicoot who told him, *"You will seek a hole, but find a mountain."*
*   **The Merchant:** A greedy echidna selling "pre-dug luxury voids" (the first sign of the High-Nose corruption).
*   **The Long-Lost Uncle:** He found a beggar on the street, who turned out to be **Uncle Hangbat**. Hangbat had feigned madness to escape the "Fixed Borow." He whispered the secret frequency of the **Dingo Code** to Hoebat.

## 4. The Fall and the Bonding
Hoebat returned to **Melborow** expecting to lead, but found the world cold. The **Kappa Mu** brothers had drifted apart. The "New Ways" of the city—isolated particles—had taken over.

*   **The Grifter:** Cynical, Hoebat became a thief of "The System."
*   **The Incident:** He was conning a High-Nose dowager with a fake ruby when he saw **Lolaboo**.
*   **The Bonding:** In the crowded marketplace, Hoebat dropped his guard and performed the **Old Way Dance**. Lolaboo saw the *Kappa Mu* fire in his eyes. They bonded—a return to **Section 10.2 (Unified Truth)**.

## 5. The Invisible Antagonist & The Present (2026)
As the narrative snaps back to the present, Hoebat stands in the rain with Lolaboo.

*   **The Realization:** He sees that the "New Ways" (apps, murals, laws) are just a **Golden Vessel**.
*   **The Threat:** The **Tall-Ones (Humans)** are coming. The "Natural Disasters" are excavators.
*   **The Transformation:** Hoebat realizes he is no longer running from homework. He is the **Architect of the Field**.

## 6. The Future: The Class Fracture
The world zooms out to the greater society of Melborow.

*   **The Rise of the Five-I's Sovereign Council:** The "Systemic Failure" allowed the High Noses to consolidate power. **Trumbat**, **Muskbat**, **Tatebat**, **Vitabat**, and **Zuckbat** formed the Council to manage external threats and coordinate (manipulate) animal delegates.
*   **The False Synthesis:** Trumbat used **Section 2.4** to blame Dingoes, while Muskbat promised the **"Melborow Frequency"**.
*   **The Architect of the Field:** While the city sleeps, Hoebat is out in the mud, using his *Kappa Mu* skills to pack clay into hairline fractures and inject gold dust into compromised load-bearing walls—repairs the Council is too corrupt to make and too proud to admit are necessary.

## 7. The Collision
Melborow is split:
1.  **Frequency-Believers** (Far-Right, led by the Council)
2.  **Tunnel-Purity League** (Far-Left)
3.  **The Hidden Root** (Hoebat’s People)

**The Climax:** A skyscraper foundation is being poured above (a Human "Natural Disaster"), pressing down on the crowns of the Grotto's unlined tunnels. The Gray Grotto is being crushed between the weight above and the Great Retaining Wall pressing in from the north. The clogged sumps overflow. The weeping walls become waterfalls. Lolaboo confronts Hoebat: *"Muskbat’s machine is a broadcast of silence... If you don't step out of the shadows, there won't be a Melborow left to save."*

Hoebat must destroy the "Great Retaining Wall of Lies" to save the borow before the springline failures cascade into total collapse.
