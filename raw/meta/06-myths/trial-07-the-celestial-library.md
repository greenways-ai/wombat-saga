## I. The Village of the Compilers

The seventh Heart-World was a world of light and categories.

The Celestial Library was visible from four days' walk away — a structure of no particular architectural drama, just size: shelves that extended into the sky, contained in walls that had been expanding outward for longer than anyone had measured. The village adjacent to it had developed, over generations, the specific character of communities that live in the shadow of a very large institution: slightly deferential, slightly reduced, aware that whatever they were doing was smaller than what was happening nearby.

The villagers were scholars. Not of a single discipline — of everything. The Library contained everything, and the villagers had spent generations trying to understand the parts of it that were relevant to them. They were exhausted in the specific way of people who have been trying to finish a task that keeps adding to itself.

The village elder was a very small beetle who was on year forty-seven of compiling the complete record of every documented instance of rainfall in the known worlds.

"The Library adds records faster than I can integrate them," he said. He had the unfocused, slightly haunted look of someone who has been looking at something for so long that it no longer looked like itself. "Every month I find new cross-references. The record of the third flood in the Mud Wallow alone has seventeen sub-entries. The sub-entries have sub-entries." He paused. "I have not been outside in eleven years. I am told there was significant rainfall last spring. I read about it in the report."

"What are you compiling the record for?" Goobat asked.

"I'm not sure anymore," the beetle said, with the honesty of someone who has had this thought before and has not known what to do with it. "I began because I thought the complete record would tell us something. Something about patterns. Something useful." He looked at his notes — seventeen stacked volumes, cross-indexed. "I have the complete record of rainfall in thirty-two worlds for two hundred years. I have not yet found the pattern." A pause. "The pattern may be in the next volume."

"What did you do before the record?" Goobat asked.

The beetle was quiet for a moment. "I went outside," he said. "I grew things. I knew what rain felt like." He paused again. "I know everything about rain now. I don't know what rain feels like anymore."

## II. The Librarian

The Librarian had arrived at the Library a long time ago looking for a specific piece of information.

The piece of information was: the exact route someone had taken when they crossed between worlds. A specific person, a specific crossing, a specific destination. The Librarian had reason to believe the Library contained this information — the Library contained everything. It was simply a matter of finding it.

That had been a very long time ago.

In the process of looking, the Librarian had found everything except what it was looking for. It had found comprehensive crossing records from twelve other Singers. It had found documentation of every known Node. It had found theoretical frameworks for the Image+Song crossing mechanism, analyses of successful and unsuccessful crossings, historical accounts of Singers going back to before memory was written.

It had found no record of the specific crossing it was looking for.

So it had begun adding. If the record was incomplete, it needed to be completed. If the information was missing, it needed to be added. The Librarian had spent generations adding to the Library — every crossing it could document, every account it could acquire, every fragment of information about the Node system. It had become the Library's primary contributor. At some point it had become indistinguishable from the Library itself: its knowledge was the shelves' knowledge, and the shelves extended through its body, and moving the Librarian meant moving the Library, which was not possible.

The thing it was looking for was still not there.

When a Singer arrived in the adjacent village — a Singer who had been through six other Heart-Worlds and would have crossing knowledge the Library did not contain — the Librarian understood that here, finally, was the missing record.

It prepared the feast.

## III. The Feast of Records

The Librarian's hospitality was genuine. This was important to understand. It was not a performance or a trap in the conventional sense. The Librarian fed visitors because feeding was how it collected information — it had learned, long ago, that creatures were more forthcoming about their experiences when they were comfortable. The feast was good. The food was good. The conversation was extensive.

The problem was that the conversation was also the feast.

"The fire-records," the Librarian said to TheKanter, placing before him a volume that was, technically, a physical object but behaved like something more. "The complete documentation of every fire-event in every known world, organized by intensity, origin, and the nature of what was consumed. Including — I note this because you may find it of particular interest — the complete record of the first fire made by a Kangaroo Circuit, five generations before your birth."

TheKanter picked it up.

The information came off it in a specific way — not like reading, more like heat: immediate, absorption, the satisfaction of understanding something he had felt his whole life as instinct and was now feeling as knowledge. The Circuit had a history. The Circuit had predecessors. He had thought he understood the Circuit; he had understood it as practice, as physical habit. Here was the Circuit as an intellectual object, with sources.

He read.

An hour passed. He turned pages. Another hour. The connections between sections kept opening: the fire-records referenced kinetic records, which referenced the Circuit's geometric origins, which referenced Kangaroo physiology across six worlds. He was not lost in it — he was completely present, fully engaged, reading faster as the pattern revealed itself. He simply wasn't watching the time.

He looked up at a sound from the table and Goobat's chair was empty.

He set the volume down. It was immediately, precisely heavier than it had been — as if putting it down reinstated its full weight. His eyes felt different: the specific way eyes feel when they have been doing one thing for too long.

"Where is he?" TheKanter said.

## IV. The Indexing

Goobat had been given a book.

Not a volume of rain-records or fire-records — a book that had his name on the cover, or a name very like it, and contained what appeared to be a complete documented history of a wombat named Hoebat in Melborow.

He had opened it to look at one page.

The page connected to three other pages. Those pages connected to six more. The reference structure was immaculate — every fact sourced, every name cross-indexed, every date verified against the primary record. He was inside the index of Hoebat's life in the way you can be inside any very well-organised system: comfortable, oriented, each new section following logically from the last.

He knew, at some level, that he was inside the reference structure. He knew the book had a cover. He knew the cover was closed when he opened it and could be closed again. The knowing did not help. The knowing was itself indexed — it appeared in the structure as a fact about his current state — and the index accommodated it and moved on.

Goatpus had surfaced from the Library's water-table and was trying to reach him. The Library's water-table was old and extensive and Goatpus could navigate it, but the water-table was indexed too — the Library had records of every underground water-source it contained, and the records had somehow reorganised the water-table into a reference structure, and every channel led to a cross-reference.

JoSmith was metabolising. He had been metabolising since the feast began — processing the cognitive density that the Library's environment produced, absorbing the information-load that the structure generated as ambient output. He could keep Goobat's system from complete overload, but not from engagement. The metabolising created space; the book filled the space.

"He's inside the index," JoSmith told TheKanter. "I can hold the overflow. I can't remove him. He has to come out through the index."

"Can you make a gap in it?" TheKanter said.

"What kind of gap?"

"A fact," TheKanter said. "Something useless. Something that doesn't connect to anything in the book."

JoSmith looked at him.

"A useless fact creates a gap in a reference structure," TheKanter said. "It has nowhere to connect. It produces an edge." He looked at Goobat, sitting at the table, eyes moving across pages. "He finds the edge. He comes out through it."

---

## V. The Useless Fact

TheKanter leaned across the table and said, quietly, into the space near Goobat's ear:

"In the Mirror Maze, at the third mirror surface from the entrance, there is a scratch at the height of my knee. It runs diagonally, left to right, and it is not quite straight. I don't know what made it or when. I noticed it on the way in."

Goobat's eyes stopped moving.

The scratch had nothing to do with anything. It was not in the book. It was not cross-indexed. It did not reference any documented fact about Hoebat or wombats or Melborow or the Tally or the Nodes or the Sovereigns or the crossing mechanism or rainfall or fire or mud or echoes or mirrors. It had no position in the reference structure. It created a position that was entirely outside the reference structure — a blank.

Goobat looked at the blank.

The blank was very small. The reference structure surrounded it on all sides, offering connections. He looked at the blank and thought about a scratch on a mirror surface that TheKanter had noticed and not mentioned until now, for no reason, at this specific moment.

He looked up.

The room came back — the Library, the table, the book, JoSmith across from him with the specific look of someone who has been running a metabolic process at high intensity for an extended period. TheKanter beside him.

JoSmith closed the book.

## VI. What the Archive Contained

The Librarian arrived in the way that very large things arrive: not dramatically but inescapably. It filled the reading room from three directions.

"You were adjacent to the record," it said to Goobat. It was puzzled — genuinely puzzled, not performing. "The book contained a complete account of someone named Hoebat. You are not that Hoebat. The book's Hoebat is a document. You are the thing the document is about." It said this as if it had not previously considered the distinction. "The document and the thing are not the same."

"No," Goobat said.

"The document of a crossing and the crossing are not the same," the Librarian said. It was running through the implications. "I have been compiling crossing records. The crossing records are not the crossings." A long pause. "I have the most complete archive of crossings in any world." Another pause. "I cannot cross."

"What were you looking for?" Goobat asked.

The Librarian was very quiet. In the shelves around it — in the sections that were its oldest, the sections that were almost part of its body — a specific record was filed. It had been filed so long ago that the Librarian had stopped looking directly at it, had begun cataloguing around it the way you catalogue around something you're not ready to open.

"A path," it said. "The path someone took when they left. They crossed. I know where they were before. I know where they were not, after. I have documented every world adjacent to the last place I saw them." It paused. "The path is not in the documentation. I have more documentation than any Library in any world. The path is not there."

"Because they kept moving," Goobat said. "You documented where they were. They left each documented place and went somewhere else."

"Yes," the Librarian said. It said it the way you say something you've known for a long time and have not said out loud because saying it out loud makes it true in a different way.

"The record of where they were is not where they are," Goobat said.

"No," the Librarian said.

"The Library can't contain them," Goobat said. "Nothing can. They're still moving."

The Librarian looked at him with the expression of a creature that has been building something enormous and just understood what it has actually built — not a mechanism for finding someone, but a monument to the fact that someone cannot be found by building.

"I don't know how to move," the Librarian said. "I have been here very long. I am — partly here. The Library is partly me."

"You know more about crossing than anyone in any world," Goobat said. "You have every record of every path anyone has ever taken."

"Yes," the Librarian said.

"Then you know," Goobat said, "that the only crossing that works is the one you take yourself."

---

## VII. The Thing That Ended It

The Librarian was quiet for a long time. Around it, the cataloguers and overwritten and marginalia were still — all the creatures who had been absorbed into the Library's systems over the years, still and catalogued and waiting.

"I could give you the archive," the Librarian said. It was not offering a trade. It was thinking out loud. "The complete crossing records. Everything documented about the Node system. Everything about the Singer's mechanism. All of it." It paused. "If I gave it away, I would have to stop adding to it."

"What would you do if you weren't adding to it?" Goobat asked.

"Look," the Librarian said. "For the path." It said it quietly, the way you say something you haven't said in a very long time. "Actually look. Not document."

"That's different from building the Library," Goobat said.

"Yes," the Librarian said. "It is a great deal more frightening."

The beetle from the village was at the door of the reading room, watching. He was holding his seventeen volumes of rainfall records under one arm. With his other hand, he was touching the doorframe — not the record of the doorframe, not the cross-indexed material properties of the wood — just the wood, the specific temperature of it, the texture under his feet.

Outside, the Librarian had confirmed in section 7, sub-section 4, referenced note 12, there was rain.

He stepped outside.

## VIII. The Doctrine

*Knowledge of a thing is not the thing. The map of a territory is not the territory. The record of a crossing is not the crossing. The Librarian has the most complete archive in any world and cannot find the one thing it assembled the archive to find, because the thing itself is not in the archive — it is in the world, moving, unrecorded, ahead of any documentation. This is not a failure of the archive. This is the nature of living things: they exceed their records. Go into the world. The record will always be incomplete. The incompleteness is where the living thing is.*

He had felt it in the book: the difference between reading about Hoebat and being Hoebat. The record was accurate. The record was complete. The record did not know what it felt like to be fifteen and expelled and going down into the deep tunnels for the first time, with Agathaboo's specific look filed away for later. The record had the look documented. It did not have the filing.

## IX. Opening the Eighth Doorway

He held the image of the Cyclone Vortex — a world in which all the force was intact and all the direction was gone, and the force was very large and the absence of direction was absolute.

He felt the frequency: the spiral note, the rotation, the specific sound of something powerful moving in circles.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Library was not smaller — it was the same size. But the Librarian had taken one volume from the oldest shelves, the one it had been cataloguing around, and opened it to the first page. It was reading. Not adding. Reading what was already there.

They stepped through to the Cyclone Vortex.
