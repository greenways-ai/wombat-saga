## I. The Village of Between

The fourth Heart-World was a place that showed you everything.

The Mirror Maze was not a maze in the architectural sense — there were no walls, no dead ends, no design. It was a world in which every surface reflected, and the reflections reflected each other, and the space between reflections was where the people lived.

The village had no name that its inhabitants used. They called it Between, or Here, or The Middle, depending on the season. It was a community of echidnas who had come to the Mirror Maze generations ago looking for something and had found, instead, an infinite supply of themselves.

The village elder was a female echidna of considerable age who had stopped, some years ago, making decisions of any kind.

"You see the difficulty," she said to Goobat, gesturing at the nearest mirror-surface — a vertical sheet of something older than glass, older than water, reflective down to the molecular level. In it, Goobat could see himself. In the reflection beside that one, he could see the elder echidna considering the same gesture from a slightly different angle. In the reflection beyond that: an elder who had not yet raised her paw. In the one beyond that: one who had already put it down.

"Every version of the version," Goobat said.

"And every version of that version's version. I used to make decisions. Then I could see, in the adjacent surface, the version of me who'd made the other decision. And she looked — fine. Not better. Not worse. But fine. And I thought: then what does it matter which I choose? And I stopped." She folded her paws in her lap. "That was eleven years ago."

"What happened to the village while you stopped?"

She looked at him with the expression of someone for whom this was not a new question. "It maintained itself. Not well. But it maintained." She paused. "There is something in the Maze. Further in. It comes when people are very still — when they've been watching their reflections long enough to stop moving. And it copies them. Takes the copy. The original stays."

"What does it do with the copies?" Goobat asked.

"Keeps them," she said. "It has been copying for a very long time. It has a hall full of copies. It's trying to find something in them." She looked into the middle distance, which happened to contain seventeen versions of herself looking into the middle distance. "I don't know what."

## II. The Mimic-King

The Mimic-King had not always been the Mimic-King.

He had been, originally, a creature of another world — he did not remember which one, because the memory of his original form had been overwritten too many times. He had come to the Mirror Maze as a young animal, something small, something that ran, and he had seen his first reflection and been arrested by it. He spent two days simply watching himself move. On the third day he noticed that the version of himself in the adjacent reflection moved slightly differently — a fractional lag, a different angle of the ear — and he had spent a week trying to understand why.

At some point during that week, he had begun to copy. Not his own reflection — other things. Visitors. Whatever passed through. He was very good at it. He could hold the full surface-detail of a thing: the gait, the pitch of the voice, the specific posture of attention or rest. He could reproduce these without error.

The problem was that copies degraded over time. The copy of a thing was not the thing; it was a snapshot, and the original kept changing, and the copy fell behind. He could see the gap. He could feel it. He had spent three hundred years trying to close it, and the gap remained the same width it had always been.

He had heard about Singers.

A Singer, the rumour said, carried Image and Song simultaneously — the image of the destination and the sound of the crossing, both in one body, at the same moment. He had been trying for three hundred years to hold both simultaneously and failing; his copies never held both, they held one and then the other in rapid alternation, too fast to distinguish from simultaneous but not, in fact, the same thing.

If he could copy a Singer — copy the act of holding both together — he might finally close the gap.

He sent his Reflections out.

## III. The Lookalike

The fire-call came in the early afternoon — not a physical fire, but the frequency: the specific range that TheKanter's body responded to involuntarily, the register that said *something is burning that should not be burning and it is close enough to need you.*

TheKanter turned north-northeast before he had consciously decided to.

"That's real," JoSmith said, testing the air. "Something is actually burning."

"Two hours," TheKanter said, already moving.

"Not two hours," Goatpus said.

"Two hours," TheKanter said, and went.

The fire-source was a scrub-fire three hours' walk back through the Mirror Maze — a real fire, natural, started by a reflection catching sunlight at an unusual angle. TheKanter contained it methodically. He was very good at this. He was so good at it that he did not notice, until he was returning, that the creature who had pointed him toward it — a figure in the Maze ahead, which he'd followed — was gone, and had left behind a set of footprints that started halfway across a mirror-surface and ended nowhere.

He stood at the end of the impossible tracks and thought for a moment.

Then he went back faster than he had come.

## IV. The Swap

The copy of Goobat was better than any copy the Mimic-King had made before.

It had the voice right. The specific way of pausing before speaking — not hesitation but the wombat habit of listening to the thought one more time before committing it to air. It had the walk. The way of touching a wall when passing near one. The angle of attention when something was being said that required consideration.

JoSmith walked beside it for three hours before the wrongness located itself.

He wasn't metabolising anything.

JoSmith processed the world continuously — he absorbed trace elements of whatever was near him: light, heat, metabolic output, the faint informational signature that living things left in air. From Goobat, he usually absorbed a steady quiet current of ground-resonance: the wombat's engagement with whatever was under him, a low-level constant presence.

From the copy, he absorbed nothing. Not the absence of something — the precise mirror of what he put in. A closed loop. A thing that returned exactly what it received without generating anything new.

He stopped walking.

The copy stopped. It looked at him. Its expression was exactly right — the look of someone who has noticed a companion stop and is waiting with patient inquiry.

"Say something I've never heard before," JoSmith said.

The copy said something. It was something Goobat would have said — contextually appropriate, pitched correctly, a response that fit the situation precisely.

"That was mine," JoSmith said. "That was something I said last week. You gave it back to me."

The copy looked at him.

"Where is he?" JoSmith said.

## V. TheKanter Sits Down

TheKanter arrived back to find JoSmith standing opposite the copy of Goobat and Goatpus watching from the water-table beneath the nearest mirror-surface.

He looked at the copy for a long moment. Then he said, without preamble: "What did I say at the Crystal Salt Pan when the Bunyip started weeping?"

The copy said what he had said. Word for word.

"What was I thinking when I said it?" TheKanter said.

The copy paused. A half-second.

"That's the gap," TheKanter said. He turned to JoSmith. "He's in the Maze."

The Mimic-King's hall was in the deepest part of the Mirror Maze — a chamber in which every surface was reflective and the reflections were not of the room but of every room the Mimic-King had ever copied. TheKanter walked through it with his fire dampened to almost nothing: in a world of reflections, fire bounced.

The Mimic-King created copies of TheKanter the moment he arrived.

Twelve of them, then twenty, then forty. All doing the same Circuit — the same leap, the same landing, the same anticipatory crouch. Every move TheKanter made was instantly reflected and countered. He feinted; they feinted. He stopped mid-leap; they stopped mid-leap. He changed his weight forward; they changed their weight forward.

He sat down.

The forty copies of TheKanter continued to move. They could not sit down; they had been copied from a TheKanter who did not sit down in confrontations. They looped through the Circuit, waiting for a move that required countering. The loop grew frantic. The copies began interfering with each other — forty versions of the same kangaroo with nowhere to put their momentum, accurate at full speed and diminishing coherence.

TheKanter sat with his paws on his knees for sixty seconds.

The copies collapsed inward, one by one, like flames losing oxygen.

## VI. Inside the Mirror

Goobat, inside the mirror-surface, had been watching his own replacement from the other side.

The mirror was not opaque from within — it was transparent, looking out onto the world, while from without it showed a reflection. He had watched the copy of himself accompany JoSmith and Goatpus for three hours. He had watched JoSmith stop. He had watched the copy fail to produce anything new.

He had thought, watching: *that's what I look like to other people.*

Not an insult — an observation. The copy was, in some ways, clearer than he was to himself. He could see the patterns: the pauses, the specific quality of his attention, the things he always did and the things he never did. The copy reproduced them faithfully. The copy was a better external model of Goobat than Goobat had of himself.

The difference was the gap between moves. The copy was continuous — always in the next action, always ready. Goobat, watching, understood that his own delays were the part that was most him. Not the actions. The space between the actions, where he was listening.

The Mimic-King appeared behind him in the mirror-space, where everything was reversed.

"I cannot copy the listening," it said. "I have tried. The listening leaves no surface to replicate."

"Because it doesn't produce anything," Goobat said. "It receives."

"I am very good at receiving," the Mimic-King said. Its original form was visible here, on the inside, where it had nowhere to perform — something small and furred, something that had been running once, something with quick dark eyes. "I receive everything. I can give it back exactly. But giving it back is not the same as—" It stopped.

"Having it," Goobat said.

"Yes," the Mimic-King said.

## VII. What the Copy Could Not Hold

TheKanter found Goobat by pressing his paw against the mirror-surface and leaping once from standing — not toward the surface but at a precise angle away from it, generating a specific vibration through the floor that he felt travel into the surface and back. The frequency returned fractionally slower than the surface itself, which meant something was on the other side adding its own mass.

He hit the surface with his forehead.

The surface opened. Goobat stepped through into the chamber, and the Mimic-King came with him — not menacing, not fleeing, just present in the way that something is present when it has nowhere else to be.

"You found him by bouncing your head off the mirror," JoSmith said.

"It worked," TheKanter said.

"I know it worked."

The Mimic-King stood in the chamber looking at the original Goobat and the copy simultaneously. Something in its face changed — some calculation running.

"The copy cannot hold what happens in the space before a decision," it said. It was speaking to itself as much as to them. "I thought the decision was the content. The decision is not the content. The space before it is the content."

"What were you trying to find?" Goobat asked.

The Mimic-King was quiet. Around it, the reflections shifted and settled.

"I do not remember what I was originally," it said. "I thought if I copied enough things, I would copy something that felt like mine. That felt like home." It looked at Goobat. "You carry the Image and the Song simultaneously. Not the image of a copy and the song of a copy. Your own. I cannot copy that. I tried. The image I could hold. The song I could hold. Together — they kept collapsing into one or the other." A long pause. "I think the together requires the original."

"What were you?" Goobat asked. "Before the copying."

"Something that ran," the Mimic-King said. "Something small. Something that ran very fast and felt the ground and was very much itself." Another pause. "I have not been that in three hundred years."

"You could stop copying," Goobat said.

"And be nothing," it said.

"And be what you still are underneath," Goobat said. "Whatever the running was. Whatever wanted to be itself badly enough to keep going for three hundred years without finding it."

The Mimic-King looked at him with the expression of someone for whom this is an entirely new formulation of a very old problem.

## VIII. The Doctrine

*Identity is not continuity of surface. The copy is perfect at the surface and empty at the centre because the centre is not a thing that holds still to be copied — it is the movement between states, the deliberate incompleteness of a thing that is still becoming. Your gaps are your proof. Your delays are your depth. Only what is finished can be perfectly replicated, and only the living thing still refuses to finish.*

He understood something about the Sovereigns' machine: it had been trying to replicate the crossing, to copy the Image+Song simultaneity into a mechanism. The mechanism was a perfect copy. It could reproduce the surface of crossing without the centre — without the specific living deliberateness of a Singer who had chosen to hold both. You cannot mechanise presence.

## IX. Opening the Fifth Doorway

He held the image of the Still Place — a world where everything had settled into immobility, where the surface was unbroken and the warmth beneath it asked nothing and the warmth was very easy to accept.

He felt the frequency: a low pull, almost comfortable, the note of a thing that had found a way to stop needing to be anything.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Mirror Maze was changing. The Mimic-King's hall was emptying — not the copies dissolving, but the Mimic-King, carefully, one by one, releasing them. Letting them be what they were. Watching, for the first time in three hundred years, what it was like to receive without holding on.

They stepped through to the Mud Wallow.
