## I. The Edge

The tenth was not a Heart-World.

The other nine had been worlds — places with soil and air and physics, with villages and weather and the specific textures of having been lived in. The Threshold was none of these things. It was the space between things: the membrane that the crossings moved through, the medium of the Nodes, the place that existed because the worlds needed somewhere to be relative to each other.

It looked like nothing. Specifically like nothing — not darkness, not emptiness, but the precise quality of a space that has no native properties, that takes on the quality of whatever looks at it. Goobat, standing at its edge, saw something like a corridor of warm light. TheKanter, standing beside him, said later that he had seen an open plain at the end of a long run. JoSmith said he had seen a set of cellular reactions, the specific cascade of a metabolic process at the moment of conversion. Goatpus said nothing, which was typical.

What they agreed on: the Threshold was warm. Not in temperature exactly — in the way that a place feels warm when it has been inhabited for a very long time by things that generated warmth. Every crossing that had ever happened had happened through here. Every Singer who had ever held Image and Song together had passed through here. The accumulated warmth of all of it was present in the Threshold, not as noise but as a kind of ambient certainty: this is what it feels like when it works.

TheKanter said: "You go in alone."

Goobat said: "Yes."

Neither of them said the other thing, which was that neither of them knew if it would work. They had been through nine worlds. Goobat had learned nine doctrines. The Threshold was not a world with a doctrine — it was the place the doctrines had been leading toward. What was in it was not a monster and not a lesson.

What was in it was the offer.

## II. Inside

He stepped through.

The others stayed at the edge — not because they were stopped, but because the Threshold had no surface for them to stand on. It existed for the crossing; it had no provision for accompaniment. He was alone in it.

He had expected the warmth to be overwhelming. It was not — it was exactly proportionate to him, the way a well-made room is proportionate to its occupant. The Threshold adjusted. It had been adjusting to Singers for longer than any Singer had been keeping records.

He heard them.

Not voices — frequencies. The specific residual signatures of every Singer who had passed through: the particular image-and-song combination, the moment of crossing, the frequency of the opening and the frequency of the closing. They were not recorded the way the Library recorded things. They were present in the way that warmth is present — not a document of warmth, but the warmth itself.

He could hear the Singer from ten generations ago, who had crossed while afraid and held the Song steady anyway. He could hear the Singer who had crossed twice in one day and the second crossing was better than the first. He could hear the ones who had crossed and not returned — not lost, just: crossed and stayed, found a world and become part of it, the way some people find the place they were going to and stop going.

He could hear what it would feel like to stay.

## III. The Offer

The offer was not made by anything. It was simply available, the way warmth is available in a warm room — not pressed on you, not demanded, but present, and the presence was its own kind of asking.

He could stay.

He would not die. He would not disappear. He would become part of the Threshold — a persistent frequency, a Singer's signature in the accumulated warmth, available for all crossings that followed. He would be the hum that other Singers felt when they crossed. He would never have to carry anything specific again — no particular Image, no particular Song, just the capacity for between, held permanently, for the benefit of everyone who needed between and found it.

It was not a bad offer.

It was a very good offer. It was, in some ways, exactly what he had been moving toward since the start of the crossing — the fullest expression of what he was, a Singer whose singing became structural. He would not be lost. He would be found, completely, in the function he was most suited for.

He stood in the Threshold and thought about this.

## IV. The Inventory

He thought about the stone-mason's brother, seventeen years in stone, who had walked out into a world that had changed without him. Not without him by choice — without him by enclosure. The brother had come out blinking and the elder had been there and they had touched paws in the light. The reunion was not without grief — seventeen years was seventeen years — but it was possible. It was a real thing that happened in a world.

That would not be available to him, in the Threshold.

He thought about the galah who had not flown in forty years and then flew through the Cyclone's wall, into the open air of a world that had kept spinning without her. It had been different, outside. Changed. She had landed with less grace than she'd had at twenty. She had also landed. In a world.

He thought about the Wallower's possum, standing in the cold with his wife's paw in his, looking back at the Wallow with the expression of something that has been comfortable for a long time and is now cold and is discovering that cold, in the presence of someone to be cold with, is a different kind of warmth.

He thought about the Mimic-King, three hundred years without an original, trying to copy itself into existence, learning that the original was not lost — was still there, underneath, the small running thing that had always wanted to be itself.

He thought about Hoebat.

Fifteen, expelled, going down. Not going somewhere that made structural sense, going somewhere the earth was still talking. Going to Hangbat's side-tunnel and watching an old wombat read a wall with the same hands and the same patience and learning that what he'd been doing alone had a name and a history and a practitioner.

He thought about Cornelibat, charged with Unauthorised Substrate Consultation, who had listened when the Tally said there was nothing to hear.

He thought about Agathaboo pulling him back by the scruff — *people get lost down there* — and then saying *come help me with the irrigation check.* Saying: the urgent thing is also the immediate thing. The large thing is also the small thing. The meaning is also in the irrigation.

He thought about the broken Node. The one in Hún Nico that had been used to bring the Sovereigns' machine into the world, that had cracked under the weight of a crossing that was not a Singer's crossing. The one that needed someone who had been through nine worlds and learned what could not be mechanised.

The Threshold was warm and the offer was real and the offer would not expire.

He stepped back through the doorway.

## V. The Return

TheKanter said nothing.

The nothing he said was the specific nothing of a person who was prepared for either answer and is not going to name which one he expected. He looked at Goobat standing outside the Threshold and his face was completely still, which on TheKanter meant something.

"We go back," Goobat said.

"Through how many worlds?" JoSmith said.

"All of them," Goobat said. "But faster. We know the way now."

"We know the way through nine worlds," Goatpus said. "The tenth world is what we came from."

"Yes," Goobat said. "And I know how to hold what the crossing needs. I didn't know that when we left."

TheKanter looked at him. "You could have stayed."

"Yes," Goobat said.

"I know you could have," TheKanter said. He said it quietly and did not say anything else about it, which was how he was with the things that mattered.

JoSmith was metabolising the Threshold's ambient output — the warmth, the residual singer-frequencies. "There's something in there," he said. "Something from the crossing you opened to get here. The original crossing." He looked at Goobat. "Someone else came this way. Before you."

"Yes," Goobat said. He had felt it in the Threshold — one of the Singer-frequencies, closer and more specific than the others, with the particular quality of something recent. Not recent in historical terms. Recent in terms of what was still in the air.

"Who?" JoSmith said.

Goobat thought about Cornelibat, charged with Unauthorised Substrate Consultation. Who had been listening when the Tally said there was nothing to hear.

"I don't know yet," he said. "Ask me when we're home."

## VI. The Doctrine

*The Singer who returns is not the same Singer who crossed. The return is the tenth trial, and it asks the question that the other nine have been preparing you to answer: knowing what you know now — knowing that the between is available and warm and permanent and without the weight of the specific — will you go back to the specific? Will you return to the world that needs you?*

*The crossing is not the destination. The destination is the world you came from, seen now from the other side of what you know. The Singer is the mechanism by which the world heals itself. The mechanism only works if it returns.*

*This is not sacrifice. This is the understanding that between is only meaningful because of the worlds on either side of it. The warmth of the Threshold is the warmth of every crossing that chose to return. It would be cold without them.*

## VII. The Way Back

The way back was faster because they knew it.

They crossed the Stone Labyrinth in a day — the Sentinel's cracks provided shortcuts, passages through what had been sealed. They moved through the Cyclone Vortex in an afternoon — the Windmaster's restored pattern gave them a directed wind that moved in the right direction. They walked through the Celestial Library without stopping — the Librarian had, in their absence, reorganised one section of the shelves to show the most useful crossing records by the main entrance, which it had never done before. *For travellers returning,* said a card in handwriting that was very small and very precise.

The Chasm of Echoes was quiet. The Echo-Lord's voice, when it spoke, was its own.

The Mud Wallow had receded slightly. The Wallower was moving — slowly, tentatively, but moving. Goobat could feel the change in the ground.

In the Mirror Maze, they passed a small running animal that moved very fast and kept to itself and had quick dark eyes and seemed, in some specific way, entirely at home in its own body.

The Bunyip's salt pan had thinned at the centre. Not healed — thinned. A channel of dark water was visible where the salt had been thickest. Something was draining.

They stepped back into Hún Nico through the original Node — the cracked one, the broken one, the one that had been used for something it wasn't built for.

It held their crossing. Not easily. But it held.
