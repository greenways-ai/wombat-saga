## I. The Village of Threadsong

The second Heart-World had a ceiling.

It was a cavern world — vast, deep, the sky replaced by an arched canopy of stone so high it produced its own weather in the middle distance. Mist collected up there and descended in slow columns. But what Goobat noticed before anything else was the light: warm, gold, moving slightly, as if the air itself were woven from something alive.

The village of Threadsong sat in the cavern's lower third, built into the rock face and outward from it on platforms and walkways that were held in place by golden threads. Everything was connected by threads — buildings to cliff, walkways to buildings, baskets and pulleys running between levels. The whole village hung in a web, and the web was beautiful, and the villagers moved through it with the ease of creatures born to it.

A market was running. Children were chasing each other across rope bridges. Someone was singing.

"This seems fine," TheKanter said, with the suspicion of a creature who has learned that things that seem fine rarely are.

They descended into the market.

---

## II. What the Weavers Do

The first sign was the old echidna.

He was sitting at the edge of the market on a wooden bench, doing nothing, and he had been sitting there long enough that the bench had shaped itself to him and he to it. Goobat sat beside him because that is what you do when someone is sitting very still — you sit beside them and wait for the stillness to become a conversation.

The echidna was watching a young possum across the market. The possum was threading a new gold strand between two buildings, attaching it to the anchor-points with the careful, practiced movements of someone who has been doing this their whole life.

"What is she doing?" Goobat asked.

"Her duty," the echidna said. "She's a Weaver. Third generation. Her mother wove, her grandmother wove. There's honour in it."

"What does she weave?"

"The obligations." He gestured at the threads — the whole structure of the village, the connected golden lattice. "Every thread is a record of a relationship. Who owes what to whom. The Weavers maintain it. Add new strands when obligations are made. Mend old ones when they fray."

"Who decides which obligations get threads?"

The echidna looked at Goobat for the first time. "The Queen," he said. "She lives at the Palace. In the upper reaches." He pointed. Up where the mist was, where the threads converged toward the cavern's heights, there was a structure — not a cave, something constructed, built from the threads themselves into a palace of layered gold silk.

"Has anyone here ever chosen not to take on an obligation?" Goobat asked.

The echidna opened his mouth, paused, and closed it. He tried again. "They would not be a member of the village," he said finally. "There would be no thread attached to them. They would have no standing."

"What happens to people with no standing?"

"They go," the echidna said. He gestured vaguely toward the cavern's dark edges. "Out there. Where the threads don't reach. Where nothing is held together." He looked at his hands. "My son went. Five years ago. Decided he didn't want the obligation the Queen had assigned him." A pause. "I don't know if he's alive. There's nothing out there."

"Did he choose the wrong obligation," Goobat said, "or did he not want any obligations at all?"

The echidna looked at the platform floor. He was quiet for a long time. "I don't know," he said. "I never asked him. I was too angry." He looked up at the palace in the mist. "You should know — there's talk in the village. The Queen's scouts have been down here this morning. Asking questions about travellers. When you came through the Node, someone saw. Word goes up fast in this place. Everything is connected."

---

## III. The Palace Receives the Report

The scout — a small, fast orb-weaver, one of dozens the Queen maintained for intelligence — had delivered its news three hours before Goobat reached the bench.

The Queen sat in her throne-room at the Palace's highest point, where the threads were so dense and layered that the walls seemed made of woven gold. She was smaller than people expected. This was always to her advantage. She had eight eyes and used all of them.

"A Singer," she said.

"The kind that crosses worlds," the orb-weaver confirmed. "He carries the Image and the Song as a single thing. The Platypus with him has been reading every surface they pass — he's a boundary-reader, difficult to trap. The Koala is a metaboliser, dangerous at close range. The Kangaroo—"

"Is a Kangaroo," the Queen said. "Find him something to leap toward."

"And the Singer?"

The Queen was quiet for a moment. She was thinking about something specific. A wombat who could open Nodes between Heart-Worlds — a Singer permanently woven into the Palace's structure would extend her network everywhere. Every Heart-World could become part of the Web. Every obligation in every world could be assigned, recorded, maintained.

"He is unthreaded," she said. It bothered her in a precise way. "A wombat with no obligations on record is an impossibility. He carries things — I can see it in the description. He owes things. He's simply never been made to acknowledge it formally." She stood, which she rarely did. "An unthreaded wombat is a gap in the fabric. It requires correction."

"The Kangaroo—"

"Send a runner to the lower market," she said. "There's a wallaby family on the east road. Offer them three reduced-thread agreements if they perform a service."

---

## IV. The Wallabies and the Eastern Road

JoSmith watched the wallaby family leave the market from across the square.

"They were just released from something," he said to Goobat. "Three generations of thread, suddenly gone light. Something was offered to them in exchange for a service." He watched the family split — mother going west, father going east with a specific destination in mind. "Someone is separating us."

TheKanter had found an injured wallaby joey near the east gate of the market. He was crouched, checking the leg, his face serious. The joey was crying with the precise volume of something that wanted to be heard from a distance.

"The leg isn't broken," JoSmith said.

"I know," TheKanter said. Without looking up. "It's a sprain. But a sprain still hurts. And she's still alone."

"It's a distraction."

"I know." He looked up at Goobat. "But her family went somewhere and she's alone with a sprained leg and it hurts and she's five years old and I'm not leaving a five-year-old alone with a sprained leg because of politics."

Goobat looked at Goatpus.

"The upper road," Goatpus said. "There's a track they'll use to run a message east. When the message goes east, TheKanter will follow."

"TheKanter," Goobat said. "When the runner comes—"

"I know," TheKanter said. For the third time. He had picked the joey up and was holding her in the crook of one arm, and she had stopped crying. "I know it's a ruse. I'm going to help her find her family and come back. One hour."

"It will not be one hour," Goatpus said.

"It will be one hour," TheKanter said, and followed the runner east.

---

## V. The Singers Come at Market-Close

The market closed at dusk when the gold light changed to something cooler and the threads above the village hummed at a different frequency — the sound of the system relaxing for the night.

Goobat, JoSmith, and Goatpus had taken a room above the market in a building that was, like everything here, suspended in thread. The walls were thin. The gold threads running through them conducted sound the way copper conducts charge — everything the village felt, they felt.

Which is why, when the Queen's Singers descended from the palace at dusk, Goobat felt them before he heard them.

Not the grief-sound of the Bunyip's Choir. Something different: a sound like being told you have done something wrong and can be forgiven. Like the specific relief of having an obligation named and assigned and set into structure. The sound of being needed in a defined way.

"It's finding the real things," JoSmith said. "Same mechanism as the salt world. Different frequency."

Goobat stood at the window. The Singers were arrayed below — twenty of them, Weavers in ceremonial thread, carrying new gold strands already formed into loops. They were not singing grief. They were singing *you are owed to this place and this place is owed to you and here is the form of that owing, here is the shape of it, put it on and you will know exactly what you are.*

Goobat felt every real obligation he carried. The Groves families. The Ghost-Diggers who had trusted him with their location. The wombats back in Melborow who were still waiting for something to change. The weight of each one, specific and actual.

The sound said: *put them into thread. Make them visible. Then they will be real in a way that can be maintained.*

JoSmith put his paw on Goobat's shoulder. "The obligations are real," he said. "The sound isn't lying about that. The question is whether naming them into someone else's structure helps you carry them."

"I know," Goobat said.

But Goatpus had already gone — out through the floor, into the thread-network below, following the electrical signature of the Web's structure to wherever it led. And with Goatpus gone, the sound reshuffled, finding the new shape of the room, and the thread that came through the window was aimed at Goobat alone.

It found the one obligation he never spoke about.

Not the Groves families. Not the Ghost-Diggers. The one before all of them: the teacher who had taught him to hear the Image and the Song, who had told him he had a capacity, who had been taken by the Censorate six months later, whose name Goobat did not say because saying it reminded him that the capacity had cost someone else everything.

The thread attached to that.

Goobat grabbed for the window frame. His paw missed.

The Weavers below caught him before he hit the ground.

---

## VI. The Palace

He woke in a room made of gold thread so fine and dense it functioned as walls — you could see through them, faintly, but you could not pass through them. The weave was perfect. No gaps.

The Queen descended from the upper room on a single thread, unhurried.

She was, as the description had indicated, smaller than he expected. This was the first disorienting thing. The second was that she was not hostile. She looked at him with professional attention — the attention of someone who has encountered an accounting irregularity and wants to understand it before she resolves it.

"You are carrying obligations that have no threads," she said. "That is a structural problem."

"They're mine," Goobat said.

"Yes," she agreed. "And unrecorded obligations decay. Without the thread, they become burden without form. They become grief, or guilt, or anger — something without the structure to be useful." She gestured at the Palace around them. "The thread doesn't add to what you carry. It gives it shape. Shape makes it manageable."

She was not entirely wrong. That was the problem with her. She was never entirely wrong.

"The teacher whose name I don't say," Goobat said. "You'd put a thread on that."

"I would record the obligation. The debt of the capacity they gave you. It would have formal existence."

"And then it belongs to the Web."

"It belongs to the record," she said. "The record is neutral."

"The record is yours."

She was quiet for a moment. "Yes," she said. "But I maintain it faithfully."

"Who says when an obligation is discharged?" Goobat asked. "When the thread comes off — who decides that?"

She looked at him. The eight eyes, all of them, looking at the same thing.

"That is determined by the structure of the agreement," she said.

"Who built the structure?"

Silence. The palace hummed around them — the sound of ten thousand obligations held under constant tension.

"You did," Goobat said. "You built the structure and you determine when obligations end and you have not, as far as I can see, ever determined that one ends."

"Obligations are ongoing," she said. "That is the nature of them."

"Some are," Goobat said. "And some you finish. And then you're free. And you don't want anyone to be free because then they leave."

The eight eyes were very still.

"I maintain the village," she said.

"You built a world so that you would have something to maintain," Goobat said. "Because—"

"Be careful," she said. Her voice, for the first time, had an edge.

"Because before the village," Goobat said, "before the first thread, what were you?"

---

## VII. TheKanter Returns

He had found the joey's family in a canyon two hours east and spent forty minutes untangling the obligation-threads that a junior Weaver had tied into the wrong configuration three generations ago, which was why the family had been functionally insolvent for forty years without knowing why. He had resolved this by the direct method of tearing the relevant threads out of the rock face, which the junior Weaver's great-great-granddaughter, who had inherited the mess, had found both alarming and deeply relieving.

He came back at a run.

JoSmith was outside the building. "Three hours," TheKanter said.

"I know," JoSmith said.

"I told you one hour."

"I know."

"Where is he?"

JoSmith pointed up. The palace in the mist, the threads converging, the warm gold light of a structure that had been holding things under tension for a very long time.

TheKanter looked at it. He looked at the threads running up from the village to the palace. He looked at his own body — the size of him, the mass, the unavoidable weight of a Kangaroo who has been eating and training for several decades.

He looked at JoSmith. "Again?" he said.

"The threads," JoSmith said, "are too fine. Even compressed, you'd snap them on the way up. They'd feel you coming." He paused. "But there's a different way into this one. The threads carry vibration. You don't have to climb them. You can travel through them."

"I'm not a vibration."

"You are when I metabolise you," JoSmith said. "You are *exactly* a vibration. The Tejo-vṛddhau is a frequency. If I convert you to frequency and put you into the thread-network, you travel at the speed of signal rather than the speed of a Kangaroo."

TheKanter thought about this. "How do I come back out as a Kangaroo?" he asked.

"You find a junction-node with enough mass to reconstitute you," JoSmith said. "There will be one in the throne room. Something structural. You'll feel it."

"And if I miss the node?"

"You would continue as a frequency indefinitely," JoSmith said.

"That would be bad," TheKanter said.

"Yes."

"Do it anyway," TheKanter said.

---

## VIII. The Thread That Carried the Fire

In the Palace, the Queen was in the middle of explaining the origins of the Web — she had been a guardian of the cavern's air, long ago, before the creatures came, and the loneliness of guarding something that nothing yet needed had been—

The throne-room junction-node exploded.

It was the largest structural node in the Palace, the point where forty-seven major thread-lines converged, and it had been absorbing a signal that was building too fast for its capacity, and when the Kangaroo reconstituted from frequency back to mass he did so with the contained force of fire that had been compressed into a thread and was extremely relieved to be a body again.

The walls of the throne-room — the woven gold walls, the perfect dense weave — burst outward in a radius. Not destroyed. Unravelled. The threads running from the Palace to the village below went suddenly slack, and the village swayed, and in the village square every creature looked up at the palace and saw the gold light change.

TheKanter stood in the middle of the throne-room, steaming, his fur standing, looking at the Queen with the expression of someone who has been a frequency for four minutes and has strong feelings about it.

The Queen had retreated to the far wall. Eight eyes, all of them on the Kangaroo.

The thread holding Goobat's room dissolved. He walked out.

"You're late," he said to TheKanter.

"The thread-travel took longer than estimated," TheKanter said.

"Are you all right?"

"I was a vibration," TheKanter said. "I have feelings about that."

---

## IX. The Room Without Threads

The Queen had not fled. This was interesting.

She stood in the remains of her throne-room and looked at the village below — the swaying platforms, the loose threads, the creatures below staring up at the palace with expressions that ranged from alarm to something she had not seen in the village before, which was curiosity about what came next.

"You asked what I was before the first thread," she said to Goobat. Not resuming the conversation — completing it. As if she had been working on the answer the whole time.

"Yes," Goobat said.

"I was very good at seeing relationships," she said. "I could see what was owed between creatures before they knew it themselves. I could see obligation forming — the moment when a kindness became a debt, the moment when a debt became a bond, the moment when a bond became a life." She was looking at the village. "I thought if I could make it visible, it would be safer. If I put it in thread, it couldn't be forgotten or denied or left unacknowledged. The obligations would be honoured."

"And then?"

"And then the threads held the obligations in place," she said. "And the obligations couldn't evolve. They stayed as I'd recorded them. And I kept adding threads because new obligations were always forming and I was the only one who could see them." A pause. "I think I may have stopped distinguishing between the obligation and the thread at some point."

Goobat nodded. "The thread isn't the obligation," he said. "The obligation is between the creatures. It exists whether or not it's recorded. Your capacity isn't wrong. The question is whether you use it to serve the relationships or to own them."

The Queen looked at him. The eight eyes, all of them, something different in them now.

"The echidna's son," Goobat said. "He's in the cavern outside. Two days east. He found a community out there. Creatures who didn't want the Web. They made their own obligations — unrecorded, unthreaded, but real." He paused. "His father doesn't know he's alive."

The Queen was quiet.

"There's a thread between them," Goobat said. "An old one. No one maintained it. It frayed." He looked at her. "You could repair it without owning it. Send word. That's all."

She was quiet for a long time. The Palace breathed around her — the structure still standing, some of the walls loose but the major threads intact.

"I have never repaired a thread without charging for the maintenance," she said.

"I know," Goobat said. "That's where to start."

---

## X. The Morning in Threadsong

The village was different when they came down.

Not transformed — different. Some of the threads were slack where the Palace's signal had released them, and the creatures in the village were standing in the square not with alarm but with the tentative quality of people who have been told their obligations are under review and don't know yet whether to feel relieved or afraid. Both, mostly. At the same time.

The old echidna was standing outside his building. He had received word from the palace an hour ago. His son was alive. Two days east.

He didn't say anything to Goobat. He looked at him with the expression of someone who has been handed something very large and needs both hands for it and cannot also shake hands.

Goobat nodded. The echidna nodded back.

They took the road east.

---

## XI. The Doctrine

The second thread settled as they walked.

*Truth is covered by golden narratives. To find it: name the Agent — who built the structure? Restore the full timeline — when did it begin and why? The obligation is real. The thread is not the obligation. The record is not the relationship.*

He thought about the Cathedral's version of itself. The authorised mythology. The story that cut the timeline at the moment of the Sovereigns' arrival and called everything before it chaos.

He thought about his teacher, whose name was Pellah, and who had said once that a capacity that costs nothing is worth nothing, and who had understood the cost when it came and had not asked Goobat to stop.

He had been carrying that as debt. It was not a debt. It was a gift that Pellah had chosen to give.

He said the name out loud.

TheKanter, walking beside him, did not ask who it was. He simply registered that the name had been said and walked on.

That was enough.

---

## XII. Opening the Third Doorway

He held the image of the Scorpion Desert — the heat-haze, two enormous things locked in a war that had gone on so long neither of them remembered starting it.

He felt its frequency: the specific dissonance of two forces that were once the same thing, now pulling in opposite directions, the world between them cracking under the load.

He sang it open.

They stepped through into heat and cold in the same air.

Behind them, in Threadsong, the Queen was on her way down from the Palace for the first time in a very long time, carrying nothing, unencumbered by thread, with a message for an echidna who had been sitting on a bench for five years waiting for something to arrive from the east.
