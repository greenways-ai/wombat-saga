## I. The Village of the Drift-Edge

The fifth Heart-World was warm in a way that was difficult to object to.

The Mud Wallow was not uniform — it had margins and gradients, zones where the mud thinned to something navigable and zones where it was so deep and still and consistent that things could sink into it and stay. The village of Drift-Edge sat at the margin, exactly at the place where the ground became uncertain: solid enough to build on, soft enough that the buildings had all, over generations, subsided a quarter-length into the clay.

The villagers were bilbies, mostly, with a scattering of other animals who had arrived from various directions and found the margin acceptable and stayed. They moved slowly. Not from any injury — from having learned, over time, that slow movement was the appropriate response to a world that would take your foot if you lifted it too fast.

The village elder was a bilby who had been married to the same possum for thirty years and had not spoken to him in eleven months.

"He drifted in," she said. She said it flatly, the way you say something you have said many times to many people and the saying no longer changes anything. "Three seasons ago. He went to the edge to look at the Wallow — we all do, everyone does it, it's just something you do when you arrive somewhere — and he sat down. He said he was just going to sit for a bit." She was looking at the mud-line as she spoke. "He didn't come back for dinner. I went to find him and he was already deeper. His eyes were open. He looked comfortable." A pause. "He was comfortable. That's the thing. He looked — actually rested. More rested than I'd seen him in years."

"So you didn't pull him out," Goobat said.

"I thought about it," she said. "He looked so comfortable." She stopped. "That was eleven months ago. He's still in there. He's still comfortable. He's just — not here. Not doing anything. Not coming back."

"What does the Wallow do with the ones who go in?" Goobat asked.

"Keeps them warm," she said. "They don't die. They just — stop. They stop needing things. They stop moving toward anything." She paused. "There's something at the centre that likes them that way."

## II. The Wallower

The Wallower had not intended to become what it was.

It had been a creature in motion once — in genuine motion, going somewhere specific, toward something it wanted. What it had been going toward was a place where someone it loved was going to be. It had been moving across a world similar to this one, steady and purposeful, and had arrived to find the place changed and the someone not there. The someone had been going somewhere else. The routes had missed each other, as routes sometimes do, in the ordinary disaster of being alive.

It had sat down.

The sitting had been temporary. A temporary sit, to absorb the information. But the ground was warm and the information was very heavy and the sitting became longer, and in the extension of the sitting, the Wallower discovered that warmth without direction is actually quite comfortable. Not happy. Comfortable. And comfortable, after grief, had felt like more than enough.

It had not moved since.

Over generations, the Wallower's body had merged with the mud it sat in. Its edges were no longer entirely distinguishable from the Wallow's edges. It was aware of everything in the mud — could feel the precise depth and temperature and stillness of every creature who had drifted in. It did not take them actively. It simply provided warmth and stillness and asked nothing, and the taking happened because most things, when presented with warmth and a request for nothing, drift gradually toward the warmth.

The Wallower knew about Singers. A Singer had passed through three generations ago, moving fast, moving toward something. The Wallower had tried to offer warmth and the Singer had not stopped. This had stayed with the Wallower in a specific way. The one that didn't stop.

When the Reflections from the previous world brought word of a Singer in the Drift-Edge margin, the Wallower did not scheme. It simply waited, in the way that something very warm and very still always outwaits something that is moving.

## III. The Fire at the Northern Margin

The fire came from the north — a dry-heat fire, the kind that moved fast across the thin margin between the Mud Wallow and the harder world beyond. It was real. It was moving toward the village.

"The Settled can't move," JoSmith said. He was already reading the fire's approach — the wind-direction, the spread rate, the specific texture of the burning material. "Anything that's drifted more than a length in — can't be pulled out fast enough."

TheKanter was already looking at the fire.

"Two hours," Goobat said.

"Not two hours," Goatpus said.

"Less than two hours," TheKanter said, and went north.

The fire was manageable — large but directable, the kind that a Kangaroo with a controlled Circuit could shape and channel. TheKanter spent an hour and twenty minutes running perimeters, cutting firebreaks, pushing the burn into a controlled progression that took it east away from the village and the Wallow's edge. He was good at this. He was very good at this. The satisfaction of the work was clean and immediate: fire responding to direction, the perimeter holding.

He did not notice the time passing until the fire was fully contained and the eastern sky was a column of managed smoke rather than a spreading front.

He went back.

## IV. The Sinking

Goobat had sat down to rest while TheKanter was gone.

This was a reasonable thing to do. They had been moving through three worlds without significant rest, and the ground at the Drift-Edge margin was soft and warm and not, in itself, a threat. He sat against a low clay embankment with his paws in front of him and his eyes open and his mind doing what his mind did when it was not being asked to do anything specific, which was run back over the things it had been through.

The mud was warm. The warmth was not aggressive — it didn't pull or suggest or invite. It simply was. The specific warmth of something that has been the same temperature for a very long time.

His eyes closed. He had not intended them to close. They closed the way they do when the body decides the decision has already been made.

He began to sink. Not quickly. A quarter-length over twenty minutes — slow enough that the adjustment was continuous and small and did not interrupt the sleep. The mud fitted itself to his shape with the patience of something that has shaped itself to many things and has developed a certain skill at the process.

JoSmith noticed when the mud had reached Goobat's ears.

He tried to pull him up. His grip on the soft clay closed on mud. He tried to reach in — the mud accepted him in the way it accepted everything, without resistance, without direction, and he found himself losing orientation within it. Not sinking — he was metabolising the mud fast enough to stay afloat — but not gaining either.

"Goatpus," he said.

Goatpus dove. The mud was too thick, too consistent — none of the channels that water-bodies have, none of the directional flow. Goatpus surfaced after thirty seconds, clay-covered, unable.

They could see Goobat's paws. Just his paws, sticking up from the surface at an angle that looked almost intentional, as if he had chosen to be there and was indicating direction.

TheKanter arrived back to this.

He stood at the edge of the mud and looked at the paws and said nothing for several seconds.

"How long?" he said.

"Maybe forty minutes," JoSmith said. "He went under gradually. I didn't — I didn't see it happening until—"

"How deep?"

"A length. Maybe more."

TheKanter looked at his own feet. He looked at the Wallow — its flatness, its warmth, its absolute refusal to have any feature he could use. He looked at the perimeter of the mud patch: circular, maybe thirty lengths across, the driest ground at the margin where they stood.

"Get back from the edge," he said.

## V. The Circuit Without Fire

He ran the perimeter.

Not the fire-Circuit — there was no fire in him right now, the previous world's cold had taken longer than expected to fully reverse and he was operating at reduced heat. But the Circuit was not only about fire. The Circuit was about mass and timing and pattern, and the Wallow had a characteristic he was looking at: it was laterally consistent. Everything in it was still. Still things could be disturbed by lateral shear — by a motion that moved across them rather than into them.

He ran the perimeter in a tightening spiral. Not inward — he didn't enter the mud — but the spiral pattern of his leaps transferred a specific vibration through the ground at the margin, a rotational force that traveled along the mud-surface rather than through it. On the third pass the mud at the centre quivered slightly. On the fifth pass it thickened at the margin and thinned at the centre. On the seventh pass a slow rotation was visible — not dramatic, a very gentle clockwise movement, the Wallow beginning to behave like a stirred liquid rather than a settled one.

Not heat. Mechanical agitation. The particles separating as the vibration loosened the cohesion.

JoSmith dove when the surface consistency changed. He was metabolising as he went — not absorbing the mud exactly, but processing it fast enough to move through it, the metabolic system running hot. He reached Goobat two lengths down and pulled.

Goobat came up slowly, the way something deeply embedded comes up when the embedding has softened.

He surfaced face-up, eyes still closed, covered in mud that was already beginning to thin and fall away. JoSmith pulled him to the margin. TheKanter stopped the Circuit. The Wallow stilled back into itself over the course of a minute, the rotation slowing, the particles resettling.

Goobat opened his eyes. He looked at the sky.

"How long?" he said.

"An hour," JoSmith said.

"I was asleep," Goobat said. He said it with the specific quality of someone who knows this is not an adequate explanation and is also not wrong.

"You were sinking," TheKanter said.

"I know," Goobat said. "I felt it. I just—" He stopped. He looked at the Wallow surface beside him — close enough to touch, calm, warm. "It wasn't unpleasant," he said. "It was—"

"Comfortable," said a voice from the mud.

## VI. What the Warmth Had Always Offered

The Wallower surfaced slowly, the way a feature of the landscape might decide to reorganize itself into something with a face. It was large — not in the way the Bunyip was large, not dramatically, but in the way that something becomes large when it has been spreading into an environment for long enough that the environment and the thing are difficult to tell apart. Its edges moved as it moved. The mud moved as it moved.

It looked at Goobat with something that was as close to affection as a creature of the Mud could manage.

"You were comfortable," it said.

"I know," Goobat said.

"Why leave?" it asked. Not rhetorical. It genuinely did not know. It had been in the mud for so long that leaving had become a question without a self-evident answer.

Goobat sat with this for a moment. The honest answer was that he hadn't wanted to, specifically, in the moment of sinking. He had been comfortable. He had been resting. He had not had a conscious objection to the continuing. The objection had come from outside — from JoSmith's voice and TheKanter's Circuit — and he had accepted it when it came, and it had not been against his will, but it also had not been entirely his initiative.

"Because comfort isn't the same as arrival," he said. "I was going somewhere. Comfort doesn't change that."

"Where?" the Wallower asked.

"Home," Goobat said. "Eventually."

The Wallower considered this. "I was going somewhere," it said. "I was going toward someone." A pause. The mud around it shifted slightly — not dramatically, just the small readjustment of a thing that has been very still and is trying to remember what motion felt like. "I sat down. I thought I would sit for a moment."

"What happened to them?" Goobat asked. "The one you were going toward."

"They went somewhere else," the Wallower said. "We missed each other." It said this as a fact, not a complaint. "I sat down to understand what had happened. And then sitting was easier than the alternative."

"What was the alternative?"

"Getting up," it said. "Going somewhere else. Finding a new direction." The mud around it was very quiet. "The ground was warm. I sat for a long time. The warmth was the same every day. That's the thing about warmth — it doesn't ask anything. You don't have to be going somewhere to be warm."

"No," Goobat said. "But you do have to be going somewhere to arrive."

The Wallower was quiet.

"I have not arrived anywhere," it said. "In a very long time."

"No," Goobat said. "But you're still here. The ability to arrive is still somewhere in you." He looked at it carefully. "You were going somewhere once. You still know the direction."

The Wallower looked at him with the expression of a creature that is being asked to remember something it deliberately stopped remembering because remembering was the thing that hurt.

"It doesn't lead anywhere anymore," it said.

"You don't know that," Goobat said. "You've been sitting."

## VII. The Thing That Ended It

The Wallower was quiet for a very long time. Around it, the Settled were very gently stirring — not waking, not rising, but the first fractional motion of things that have been still too long and have caught, at the edges of their stillness, the specific question of whether they chose this.

"If I moved," the Wallower said finally, "the Wallow would cool."

"Yes," Goobat said.

"The Settled would—" It stopped. "They didn't ask to be here. Most of them. They sat down and I kept them." It said this without self-judgment, the way you account for something when you're ready to account for it. "I kept them because the warmth needed somewhere to be. And they needed somewhere to be warm." Another stop. "That is not the same as choosing."

"No," Goobat said. "It's not."

"I will need to—" The Wallower looked out over the Wallow surface, at the particular stillness of it, the specific warmth. "I don't know how to do this slowly enough."

"Start with one," Goobat said. "The possum. His wife is at the village margin. She has been waiting."

## VIII. The Doctrine

*The Mud does not deceive. It offers what it has: warmth, stillness, the end of effort. The deceiving is in the not-noticing that a choice is being made. Comfort becomes a world when you stop checking whether you are choosing it. The check is not comfort's enemy — the check is what keeps comfort honest. Rest when you choose to rest. Move when the resting is done. The difference between the two is not always obvious, and the Wallow's patience is longer than your awareness, so check early and check often.*

He had been in the mud for an hour and had felt, inside it, what the Sovereigns' city offered: the warmth of a system that asked nothing. Hún Nico asked nothing. The Tally asked nothing if you kept your Womb-Id clean and your record clear and your head down. The comfort was real. The cost of the comfort was only the direction.

## IX. Opening the Sixth Doorway

He held the image of the Chasm of Echoes — a place where every sound was returned to you, and the return was so accurate that you could no longer find the original source.

He felt the frequency: the doubled note, the hall-of-mirrors sound, every voice arriving a fraction after itself.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Mud Wallow was beginning, slowly, to move. Not dramatically — the first stirring of a thing that has been still for a generation, the surface beginning to differentiate, to have currents rather than consistency.

At the margin, a possum was standing at the edge with his wife's paw in his, looking back at the Wallow with the expression of someone who has been comfortable for a very long time and is now cold, and is discovering that cold, in the presence of someone to be cold with, is survivable.

They stepped through to the Chasm of Echoes.
