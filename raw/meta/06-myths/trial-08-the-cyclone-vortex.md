## I. The Village of the Eye

The eighth Heart-World moved constantly and had one still point.

The Cyclone Vortex was a world of perpetual rotation — enormous spiral wind-patterns, each one controlled imperfectly by a Windmaster who could no longer remember the precise commands that had once made the winds behave. The winds were not malicious. They were not anything, really, except forces that had once had direction and no longer did, and were very large.

The village was in the eye of the largest Cyclone — the one place in the eighth Heart-World where nothing moved. The stillness there was absolute and slightly wrong in the way that absolute stillness is always slightly wrong when it exists inside something that is constantly spinning.

It was a community of galahs, mostly, with a scattering of other birds who had found the eye and stayed. They had been here long enough that some of them had forgotten they could fly. Not that their wings had weakened — they were anatomically capable. They had simply not used that capability in so long that it had become, in their minds, theoretical.

The village elder was a very old galah who had not left the eye of the Cyclone in forty years.

"It came in when I was young," she said. Her plumage was intact, maintained with the specific care of someone who does not have much else to maintain. "The Cyclone. It was smaller then — more directed, more purposeful. You could see the pattern in it if you watched long enough. Then something happened to the Windmaster and the pattern went out of it, and it became — this." She gestured upward, where the Cyclone's wall was visible as a white rotating line at the top of the clear air column. "Safe in here. Very safe. Nothing comes in."

"Nothing goes out either," Goobat said.

"No," she said. She said it without complaint. "We have what we need. The eye provides. It's a very comfortable place." A pause. "It is very still. Very quiet." Another pause. "We have been here a long time."

"Do you miss it?" Goobat asked. "Flying."

She looked at him with the expression of someone who has received a question that has no safe answer and has become expert at not receiving it. "I remember what it was like," she said carefully. "That's enough."

## II. The Windmaster

The Windmaster had not intended to create this.

The Cyclone had been a masterwork — a precisely calibrated wind-distribution system that irrigated the plains of the eighth Heart-World, carried seeds between the growing zones, moved warm air from the southern coast to the cold northern plateau in the specific seasonal intervals that the northern plateau needed to sustain its plant-life. The Windmaster had developed it over decades. The pattern was intricate and it was beautiful and it worked.

Then the loss had come.

The loss was specific: the Windmaster had directed the Cyclone to carry something, and the Cyclone had carried it, and the thing it carried had not returned. Not caught in the Cyclone — the Cyclone was not that kind of force, it didn't trap things, it moved them. The thing it had carried had been moved to where it was going and had not come back from where it was going, which was not the Cyclone's function or fault.

The Windmaster had tried to grieve and steer simultaneously.

This was not possible. The grief pulled the attention inward, and the steering required attention outward, and in the gap between the two the pattern had unravelled. A wind-system without a pattern is still a wind-system — it does not stop existing because it loses its design. It simply continues without design, self-sustaining, pulling in the large amounts of rotational energy that the world supplied and amplifying them without any distribution mechanism to channel the amplification.

The Cyclone had become very large.

The Windmaster was still inside it. It had been trying, from within the rotation, to reestablish the pattern. From within the rotation, the pattern was invisible — everything was the Cyclone, and the Cyclone was everything, and the Windmaster moved with the Cyclone now rather than moving the Cyclone. It had lost the ability to distinguish between itself and the force it was supposed to be directing.

It was not aware of the Singer in the eye of the Cyclone. It was barely aware of anything outside the rotation anymore.

## III. The Still Point

The eye was genuinely safe. TheKanter walked through the Cyclone's wall — which took some time and significant effort, the wall being approximately twenty lengths thick and very fast — and emerged into the still air of the eye with grass in his fur and wind-burn on the leading surfaces and a degree of wind-deafness in his left ear.

He walked through the village. The galahs watched him with the interest of creatures who have not had a novel arrival in some time.

The galah elder told him about the Windmaster. She told him about the young ones — the ones born in the eye who had never been outside it, who did not know what wind felt like as a moving thing rather than a distant roaring. She told him, haltingly, about the way the eye felt different in different seasons — sometimes larger, sometimes smaller, the Cyclone changing its dimensions without warning.

"We have thought about leaving," she said. "Some of the young ones. Through the wall."

"The wall can be crossed," TheKanter said. "It's difficult but possible."

"I know," she said. "I know it can be crossed." She looked at her wings, folded precisely at her sides. "I have known it for forty years." She looked up at the Cyclone wall. "Every year I think: next season. When the wall thins. Next season."

TheKanter was quiet for a moment. "What would you do on the other side?"

"Fly," she said, very simply. The word had the quality of something she had been holding very carefully for a very long time.

He was still sitting with this when he heard Goobat's voice from outside the eye — not words, just the register, just the frequency, and then the register was moving upward and away.

He went through the wall at full speed.

## IV. The Rotation

Goobat had been standing in the open.

There was no scheme. The Cyclone did not know he was there. The Windmaster did not know he was there — or if it did, it was in the way that the Cyclone knew everything that was in it, which was not particular knowledge but ambient awareness. Goobat was simply in the open when the Cyclone's wall expanded slightly, as it did sometimes, and the expansion swept him up.

He was sixty lengths up and rotating before he understood what was happening.

The rotation was not violent. It was the most organized experience he had had in eight worlds — everything moving at the same speed in the same direction, the debris field around him consisting of seeds and leaves and one completely intact small clay pot that was spinning with the dignified patience of something that had been in the Cyclone for some time and had made its peace with it.

He was not falling. He was not being squeezed. He was simply incorporated into a system that did not have room for him to be outside it.

He tried to sing a note to test his voice. The Cyclone took the note and distributed it around the rotation — the note arrived back at him from every direction at once, coming from Cyclone-scale distances, smeared into something that sounded like nothing he had produced.

He held the Image and the Song and waited to see what happened.

JoSmith, on the ground, tried to metabolise the wind fast enough to slow it. The Cyclone was too large — he processed what he could and the visible effect was nothing. Goatpus was already in the water-table, which ran underground through the eighth world without being affected by the surface rotation, but there was no water between Goatpus and the Cyclone's interior.

TheKanter came through the wall and stood in the open below the rotation and looked up at his Singer sixty lengths up in the debris field.

"He's not falling," JoSmith said. "The rotation is consistent."

"I need to bring him down without stopping the Cyclone entirely," TheKanter said. "If the Cyclone stops at full size, everything in it drops at once."

"What can you do from the ground?"

TheKanter looked at his feet. At the Cyclone's base — the place where the wall met the ground, the transition between surface and rotation. He could see the structure from outside in a way the Windmaster, inside, couldn't: the spiral was self-sustaining at the upper levels but dependent on the ground-level dynamics at its base. The base generated the uplift. The uplift sustained the rotation above.

If he disrupted the base dynamics without stopping them — if he created a competing rotational pattern at ground level, a counter-spiral that interfered with the Cyclone's ground connection — he could reduce the uplift force locally, which would lower the altitude of everything in the interior, including Goobat.

He began to run.

## V. The Counter-Spiral

The Circuit was a perimeter pattern. The spiral was a perimeter pattern run inward rather than around — each pass tightening, reducing, closing the diameter. TheKanter ran it counter to the Cyclone's rotation: the Cyclone moved clockwise, he moved anti-clockwise, each pass inward a half-length from the last.

The first five passes did nothing visible.

On the sixth pass he felt the ground resistance change — the Cyclone's base was responding to the competing rotational force, the two systems interfering at the ground level, the Cyclone's grip on the soil loosening fractionally. On the eighth pass, the Cyclone's wall at the base developed a slight irregularity — a flutter, a brief inconsistency in the white wall, as if the rotation wasn't quite sure of itself at that altitude.

Sixty lengths up, Goobat felt the rotation slow by perhaps a fifth.

He was at forty lengths when the altitude began to drop. At thirty lengths, slow enough that the drop was controlled — the debris field settling, the clay pot descending in a dignified spiral that suggested it had been through this kind of thing before. At twenty lengths, the rotation was slow enough that Goobat could distinguish directions again.

He dropped the last fifteen lengths on his own — not a fall, a controlled descent, arms out, the specific body-management of a creature who has learned, over eight trials, to trust that the ground will be there and to be ready for it.

He hit and rolled.

TheKanter stopped the counter-spiral. The Cyclone's base irregularity smoothed over. The rotation resumed its previous consistency, no more or less stable than before, the system unchanged except in its lower altitude.

Goobat lay on the ground and looked at the sky — at the Cyclone wall rotating above him, white and vast and completely impersonal.

"You could have said you were going to stand in the open," TheKanter said.

"I didn't know the Cyclone was going to expand," Goobat said.

"Neither did it," TheKanter said.

## VI. What the Wind Had Lost

The Windmaster descended from the Cyclone's interior gradually, the way something emerges from a rotation when the rotation has been partially disrupted — pulled toward the outside, the centre no longer holding it entirely.

It was not what Goobat had expected. Not a large creature. Not a creature of obvious power. Something middle-sized, looking slightly disoriented, with the specific look of something that has been inside a force for so long that coming outside it requires readjustment.

"You disrupted my Cyclone," it said.

"Your Cyclone took my Singer," TheKanter said.

"The Cyclone does not take. It includes." The Windmaster was looking at the Cyclone's base, at the counter-spiral residue in the ground. "That was a precisely executed interference pattern," it said. "Anti-rotational, ground-conducted, inward-closing." It sounded, very slightly, like someone who has been dealing with wind-systems for a very long time and is professionally interested despite itself. "I couldn't have done it from inside."

"What was the original pattern?" Goobat asked. "Before it became this."

The Windmaster turned to look at him. Then it began to describe it.

The original pattern was an irrigation distribution system — a seasonal schedule of wind-direction, carrying moisture from the coast to the inland, seed from the growing zones to the fallow zones, warm air from south to north in the cold months. It had taken decades to calibrate. The Windmaster described it the way you describe a piece of work you were proud of — with specific technical detail, with the natural recall that comes from having built something you cared about with great care.

In the middle of describing the cold-month north-wind channel, the Windmaster stopped.

"Something was carried by it once," it said. "In the cold month. I directed the Cyclone to carry it." A pause. "It was the wrong direction. I miscalculated. The thing I was carrying was not — it was not cargo. It was—" The Windmaster stopped again. "I sent someone north when north was wrong. I realized too late. I tried to redirect and the redirection came too late and the pattern— I lost the thread." A very long pause. "They didn't come back from north. I don't know if that was because of me or because north was where they were going anyway."

"Do you know which it was?" Goobat asked.

"No," the Windmaster said. "I have been in the Cyclone since then. From inside it, I couldn't find out. I couldn't get out to look." It looked at the Cyclone wall. "And while I stayed inside, the Cyclone kept running." A pause. "I think I kept it running. I think I didn't want it to stop because if it stopped, there would be nothing between me and the question of which direction was wrong."

---

## VII. The Thing That Ended It

Goobat said: "You can stop it."

"Everything in it falls," the Windmaster said.

"You can slow it first. You've lost the calibration but you know the pattern. You just described the entire pattern to me in detail."

The Windmaster looked at it. "I described what it was," it said. "I'm not certain I can restore what it was. The Cyclone is much larger now."

"You don't have to restore it to what it was," Goobat said. "You just need to stop adding to it. The size will reduce on its own if you stop maintaining the rotation." He paused. "And then you can go look. North. For what happened."

"I may not find anything," the Windmaster said.

"You may not," Goobat said. "But you'll know if you went the wrong direction. Which is better than not knowing."

The Windmaster was quiet for a long time. The Cyclone rotated above them, patient, self-sustaining, waiting.

"I will slow it," it said. "I know how to slow it. It will take time. Things in the rotation will need to be brought down carefully." It looked at the eye, visible in the distance — the column of still air, the galah village inside it. "The ones in the eye will have to choose. Whether to stay or leave."

"Some of them have been waiting to leave for forty years," Goobat said.

The Windmaster began to work. From outside, the calibration was visible in a way it had never been from inside. The Windmaster moved through the rotation's edge, adjusting the force at specific points, reintroducing the directional logic that had been absent for decades. Slowly. The Cyclone did not diminish — not yet — but it began to have a pattern again.

The galah elder, in the eye, felt the rotation change. She felt the specific shift of a force beginning to be directed again, after a long time of being undirected. The eye walls thinned fractionally as the pressure equalized.

She spread her wings.

She didn't fly. Not yet. She just spread her wings, in the still air of the eye, for the first time in forty years, and felt what that felt like.

Then she flew. Into the thinning wall. Through it. Out.

## VIII. The Doctrine

*Force sustains itself when direction is lost. The Cyclone was not doing harm on purpose; it had forgotten its purpose and continued doing what it was built to do, without the directing will to stop it when it was done. You cannot grieve and steer at the same time — the attention required for grief and the attention required for direction are both total, and the attempt to split between them loses both. So: stop. Grieve. Let the force run down while you grieve. Then restore the direction. This is not weakness. This is the honest accounting of what is actually possible.*

He had been in the Cyclone and had held the Image and the Song and waited. This was worth noticing. Six worlds ago he might have spent the time in the rotation trying to act. In the rotation, action was not available — only patience, only holding, only trusting that the others were working from outside. Holding the Image and Song while doing nothing else was, he was learning, a complete act. Not a lesser one.

---

## IX. Opening the Ninth Doorway

He held the image of the Stone Labyrinth — a world of permanent surfaces, of things enclosed for so long that enclosure had become their nature, of a guardian without a ward still performing its function.

He felt the frequency: the mineral note, the held note, the sound of something that has been still so long that stillness has become its whole purpose.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Cyclone was slowing. Not stopped — it would take time, longer than they had, to fully wind down. But directed again. The Windmaster moving through it with the thread of the original pattern, reintroducing the seasonal logic, the coast-to-inland moisture schedule, the seed-carrying channels.

North of the Cyclone, on a clear path, the Windmaster would go, when the work was done, to find out what had happened in the cold month. To learn which direction was wrong.

They stepped through to the Stone Labyrinth.
