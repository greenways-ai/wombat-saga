## I. The Village of the Silent

The sixth Heart-World was a canyon so deep its walls were invisible from the floor, and the floor was where everyone lived, and no one spoke.

The Chasm of Echoes had been a sound-world once — a resonant canyon populated by creatures who had developed elaborate vocal cultures over generations, whose language had relied on the Chasm's specific acoustic properties the way some languages rely on tone. The Chasm returned every sound with perfect fidelity, at the same volume, from different directions. For the creatures who had grown up in it, navigation of the echoes was instinctive — they could hear which voice was original and which was return.

Then the Echo-Lord had come, and the echoes had multiplied, and the creatures had lost the ability to tell the difference.

The village was a community of lyrebirds. They communicated now entirely by gesture — an elaborate visual language, precise and beautiful and completely silent. They communicated well. They just did not speak.

The village elder was a lyrebird who had not sung in twenty years. His tail was the most elaborate Goobat had ever seen — the long outer feathers, the lace-work between, the absolute precision of its geometry. He had been maintaining the tail's perfection for twenty years with nothing else to do with his mornings.

*I was a singer,* he signed. *Not in the way you are. In the way that I made sound and the sound was beautiful and the canyon returned it and the return was part of the song. The Echo-Lord changed what comes back.*

"What does it change it to?" Goobat asked.

*Whatever will confuse you. Whatever will make you doubt the original.* The elder's hands moved with the particular economy of someone who has been saying the same things in sign for a long time. *It returns your voice back to you, but not quite. Close enough to recognise. Different enough that you can't trust it. After a season of this, you can't trust your own voice at all.*

"What does it want?" Goobat asked.

The elder's hands paused. Then: *Something only you can give it. It has been waiting for something that crosses worlds. It has been waiting for a long time.*

## II. The Echo-Lord

The Echo-Lord had come to the Chasm from somewhere else — from a world without sound, or so it said when it occasionally said anything, which was rarely and in borrowed voices.

It had discovered the Chasm's acoustics and understood immediately what they offered: a perfect amplification system, a mechanism for reproduction so accurate that the reproduction was indistinguishable from the original to any listener who did not have access to the original source. The Echo-Lord had a talent for voices. It could hear a voice once and reproduce it. In the Chasm, it could reproduce it from every direction simultaneously.

It had been building a collection for a long time.

The collection was not of physical things — of recordings, copies, the sounds themselves. It had a hall of stored echoes: calls that were still bouncing between the specific surfaces it had arranged for preservation, calls from creatures who had long since left the Chasm or died. Every voice it had ever heard was available to the Echo-Lord, from any direction, at any volume, in any combination.

The problem was that the collection was closed. Nothing in it could produce anything new. It could recombine, and the recombinations were sometimes surprising, but the surprise was only novelty — different arrangements of the same components. Novelty was not the same as originality.

What the Echo-Lord wanted was the Voice of Crossing: the specific frequency that a Singer used to open a Node. Not a recorded copy of the frequency — a recorded copy would open a recorded copy of the Node, a simulacrum, a door to a copy-world with nothing behind it. It wanted the living frequency. The Singer. If it had the Singer, it could cross to any world it chose, whenever it chose, without the limitations of the Chasm.

It sent its Murmurers out to prepare.

## III. The Voice of TheKanter

The Echo-Lord produced TheKanter's voice calling for help from the north-west edge of the Chasm.

Not a rough imitation — the Echo-Lord had been listening since they arrived and had had three hours to capture and refine every vocal signature in the group. It produced TheKanter's voice at exactly the pitch and urgency of a distress call — the specific quality of a kangaroo calling across distance, the register that carried.

TheKanter's head came up.

"That's your voice," Goobat said.

"I know," TheKanter said. He was very still. "That's my distress register."

"It's not you calling," Goobat said.

"I know," TheKanter said. He was running the calculation — the distance to the echo-source, the time it would take to check it, whether the Echo-Lord's sophistication extended to distress calls. The question was: what if it wasn't the Echo-Lord? What if someone had captured enough of his register to reproduce it because they'd heard him use it and they were in genuine trouble?

He went. He was built to respond to that register and could no more ignore it than ignore fire.

The voice kept moving north-west as he moved toward it. He noticed this and kept going. He noticed the tracks he was leaving and kept going. He ran the voice's origin against the Chasm's acoustic geometry for twenty minutes before he accepted that the source was not fixed — that the Echo-Lord was producing it from different surfaces to simulate movement.

He turned back. He was two hours from the village.

He went back faster than he had come.

## IV. The Sound-Cage

The Echo-Lord came to Goobat gently.

It did not come as the Echo-Lord — it came as Goobat's own voice, from slightly ahead of him in the Chasm, saying something Goobat had said in Trial Two, in a context that almost made sense here, but not quite. The not-quite-ness was the thing that caught him. He moved toward the sound trying to locate the wrongness.

The Murmurers were waiting in the deeper Chasm — creatures who had been in the Echo-Lord's service for so long they had become part of its voice-system, each one responsible for maintaining the echo of a different thing. They circled Goobat at a distance, each producing a fragment: his own words from earlier that day, a note he'd sung at the Salt Pan, the specific ambient frequency he generated when he was holding Image and Song together. The fragments came from different directions, overlapping.

He stopped walking and closed his eyes, trying to locate the original source by eliminating the echoes.

The Echo-Lord added more.

Each direction Goobat oriented toward became noisier. The Chasm's walls returned everything he himself produced — his breath, his footsteps, the subsonic he carried from the ground. The Echo-Lord layered its collection over the natural returns. North and south and east and west became equally indistinguishable.

He sat down. Not from defeat — from recognition: moving without direction in an environment where every direction was equally misleading was how you became completely lost. Standing still was the better option.

The Murmurers closed in. The cage was not physical. It was a sound-space that was a perfect reproduction of wherever he tried to go — the Echo-Lord kept him in place by echoing his surroundings so accurately that movement felt like no movement.

"You crossed here willingly," the Echo-Lord said, from everywhere. "The first Singer who has not run. They always run."

"Running seemed pointless," Goobat said.

"Your voice," the Echo-Lord said. It had never used a single voice before — always the collected voices, the borrowed register. It was trying, now, to produce a voice of its own, and what came out was a clutter: fragments cycling through each other, nothing settling into a consistent source. "The crossing-frequency. The note that opens. Give it to me and I release you."

"It doesn't work that way," Goobat said. "You can't be given a frequency. You have to be the one holding the image it's connected to."

"I have heard you sing," the Echo-Lord said. "I can reproduce what I hear."

"You can reproduce the sound," Goobat said. "Not what's behind it."

There was a silence that was the closest the Chasm had come to silence in twenty years.

## V. TheKanter's Feet

TheKanter came back from the north-west at a run and stopped at the point where the sound-density changed — the edge of the cage, where the echoes multiplied past the natural Chasm level.

He could not hear Goobat. Everything in the cage was Goobat-frequency, reproduced from every direction.

He stood at the edge and assessed the options. His voice was useless — the Echo-Lord could reproduce anything he said before he finished saying it, turn it back on him from a different direction, fill the cage with his own calls until Goobat couldn't navigate by them. JoSmith could metabolise sound but not at this density, not without being inside the cage. Goatpus was in the water-table, where the Chasm ran dry.

TheKanter stood very still and thought about what the Chasm could not do.

The Chasm's echoes were airborne. The Echo-Lord's control was airborne — acoustic, surface-bounced, dependent on the canyon walls and the specific geometry of the reflected space. The ground was not part of the system. The ground was just the ground.

He sat down and placed both palms flat against the Chasm floor.

He began to tap. Not randomly — the specific rhythm he used in the Circuit, the landing-pattern, the beat-count. Not a word in any language. A pattern they had been running together through five worlds. The pattern of *I know where you are, come toward me.*

Ground-conducted. Not a sound in the air — a vibration in the stone, traveling laterally through the Chasm floor at the speed of rock rather than the speed of air, reaching Goobat through his own feet rather than through his ears.

Inside the cage, Goobat felt it through the ground.

He had not felt anything through the ground since the cage closed — the Echo-Lord had excellent acoustic coverage but no contact with the substrate. He felt the pattern in his feet, the specific rhythm, the count.

He moved toward it.

The sound-cage followed him. But following him required the Murmurers to reposition, and repositioning took fractional seconds, and in the fractional seconds between positions the coverage thinned at the leading edge and he could feel the direction of the thinning, and that direction was where the rhythm was clearest.

He walked through the gaps.

## VI. What the Collection Held

The Echo-Lord emerged when the cage dissolved — smaller than its voice suggested, a creature of medium size with very large ears and eyes that had the unfocused quality of something that has been listening more than looking for a very long time. It was surrounded by the accumulated echoes of its hall: fragments still bouncing, calls preserved in the specific geometry of the air around it.

"Your companion used the ground," it said, without particular feeling.

"He's good at that," Goobat said.

"I did not think of the ground." The Echo-Lord looked at its own hands. "I have been working with air for a very long time. I forgot about the ground." It was cataloguing this as a gap in its system. "I will not forget again."

"What do you want the crossing for?" Goobat asked.

The Echo-Lord was quiet. In its collection, a specific sound played at low volume — the voice of something, something it had heard long ago, saying something Goobat couldn't make out.

"I want to go," it said finally.

"Where?"

"Away from the Chasm," it said. "I have been in the Chasm for — I don't know how long. The echoes keep everything. I can hear everything I've heard since I arrived. The oldest sounds are still here, still bouncing. I cannot hear anything new because the old sounds fill the space." It paused. "I want a world where the sounds don't come back. Where when something ends, it ends."

"Why did you come to the Chasm?" Goobat asked.

Another quiet. The specific quiet of a thing that is going to have to produce an answer it has been not-producing for a very long time.

"I was looking for someone who had come here," the Echo-Lord said. "Someone whose voice I was keeping. A voice I wanted to return to its owner." It touched the air near its ear — the gesture of someone indicating a preserved sound. "I found the Chasm. I heard what it could do. I thought: if I learn to use this place well enough, I will be able to broadcast the voice far enough to reach them wherever they are." Another pause. "I have been making it louder for a very long time. I have not found them."

"Do you still have the voice?" Goobat asked.

"Yes," the Echo-Lord said.

"Do you know where they went?"

"No."

"Then making it louder won't help," Goobat said. "You would need to go toward them. Not send the sound."

The Echo-Lord looked at him with the expression of something that has just been told the shape of its mistake and is in the process of understanding exactly how long ago it was made.

## VII. The Thing That Ended It

The Echo-Lord stood in the open Chasm and produced, for the first time in its own voice — not borrowed, not collected — a single sound.

It was small. It had been sitting unused for so long that it had no particular character. A note, somewhere in the middle register, not beautiful, not ugly. The Chasm returned it to the Echo-Lord from the walls and the Echo-Lord heard it come back and it sounded like someone else's voice.

"That's you," Goobat said. "That's what you sound like."

"It doesn't sound like anything," the Echo-Lord said.

"It sounds like something that has been keeping very quiet for a very long time," Goobat said. "That's not the same as nothing."

The elder lyrebird was standing at the village margin, watching. His hands moved, once, in something that was not the efficient gesture-language of the village but something older, something he hadn't used in twenty years. He spread his tail.

## VIII. The Doctrine

*A voice without an original source is an echo seeking a wall. The act of speaking is the act of taking responsibility for what you meant. An echo is meaning without a speaker — it carries the shape of the original but not the intention, and intention is the part that allows someone to respond rather than merely reflect. Find the original. Be the original. Speak from the original, even when the echo is louder and more certain and arrives from every direction at once. The original is identified by the fact that it starts rather than continues.*

He understood something about the Sovereigns' machine and the singing it tried to replace. The machine could reproduce every element of a crossing except the intention — the specific singer's will to be in this world and not another, to carry this image and not a copied image. The machine produced crossings that went somewhere, but not somewhere anyone had chosen.

## IX. Opening the Seventh Doorway

He held the image of the Celestial Library — a place of accumulated knowing, shelves extending in all directions, everything recorded and nothing lost except the ability to find the specific thing.

He felt the frequency: the over-full note, the sound of a vessel with too much in it, the way silence sounds when it has been replaced by indexed categories.

He sang it open.

Behind him, the Chasm was quieter. Not silent — the Echo-Lord's collection was still there, would always be there, the sounds preserved in the canyon's geometry. But the additions had stopped, and some of the Murmurers were simply listening to what had already been collected rather than producing more. Listening, for the first time, rather than reproducing.

They stepped through to the Celestial Library.
