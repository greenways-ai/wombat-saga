## I. The Village of Ashground

The third Heart-World was neither hot nor cold — it was both, in the same air, at the same moment, and the body could not decide which way to respond to that.

The village of Ashground sat in a narrow band of survivable temperature between the fire-scorched south and the crystallized cold north. Everything in it was built to be moved. The houses had wheels. The market stalls folded in under a minute. The children played elaborate games involving quick disassembly, and they were very good at it, and there was no pride in it anymore, just competence.

The village elder was a goanna who had been singed on one side and frost-bitten on the other and wore both with the specific dignity of someone who has stopped trying to explain their scars.

"The Serpent comes from the south," she told Goobat. "Every few weeks, when his fire builds too high. He doesn't come to attack us specifically. He comes because his fire has nowhere to go and it goes south-to-north, and we're in the way." She was watching the southern sky as she spoke — the habit of someone who has been watching it their whole life. "The Monitor comes from the north. Same logic. Her cold builds and goes north-to-south. We're in the way of both."

"How long has the war been running?" Goobat asked.

"My grandmother's grandmother says it started in her grandmother's time. Before that, they were apart. They had territories. They didn't overlap." She paused. "My grandmother's grandmother says something happened between them. A wrong that was done and never answered. But by the time she told the story, it had been so long that neither side remembered what the wrong was. They just knew the fighting came before everything else they could remember."

"They forgot the reason and kept the war," Goobat said.

"Wars are easier to maintain than reasons," she said.

## II. The Treaty of Convenience

The King Brown's nest was a crater of blackened stone in the southern reaches, permanently above the temperature of boiling water, filled with the smell of something burning that had been burning for a very long time.

His scouts brought the news in the late morning: a Singer had come through the north Node. A Wombat carrying Image and Song together, moving through Ashground with three companions.

The Serpent lay in his crater and thought about what a wombat like that would taste like. He was not thinking metaphorically. Earth-dense, salt-rich, carrying the specific mineral signature of a creature who had been in multiple worlds — the accumulated substance of crossing. He had not eaten anything that concentrated in many years.

He sent a runner north.

The Monitor Queen's territory was the opposite of his: a crystalline plain of perfect cold, every surface a mirror of ice, the air so still it felt pressurized. She received the runner in her throne of frozen stone and listened to the message without expression.

She was not interested in eating the Singer. She was interested in what the Singer knew — the mechanism of crossing, the Image+Song pair. She had been trying to leave this world for three generations. She had everything needed for crossing except the capacity to hold both image and song simultaneously; she could hold one or the other but not both, and every attempt had failed and the failures had driven her further into the cold until the cold was not just her territory but her nature.

The runner brought back the Monitor's reply: *I will take the Singer. You take the Kangaroo.*

The Serpent weighed this. He wanted the Singer. He also knew the Monitor's cold was the one thing that could keep the Kangaroo's fire off him while he worked. He agreed.

## III. The Challenge

The Serpent's challenge came at noon, delivered by a skink messenger who handed TheKanter a scale — one of the Serpent's own, still warm — and said: *He asks whether the Kangaroo's fire is real fire or the performance of fire.*

TheKanter held the scale. He could feel the heat of it even after the journey.

"It's a ruse," JoSmith said.

"Of course it's a ruse," TheKanter said. "He wants to see my fire so he can understand how to eat around it." He was still looking at the scale. "But he's also genuinely asking. His fire has been running unchecked for three generations. He doesn't know what controlled fire looks like anymore."

"You don't have to answer him," Goobat said.

"I know," TheKanter said. "But if I don't, his fire keeps coming north and Ashground keeps moving and the children keep packing their houses and not being proud of it." He set the scale on the ground. "Two hours."

"It will not be two hours," Goatpus said.

"Two hours," TheKanter said, and went south.

The Monitor's cold came from the north twenty minutes later. Goobat felt it first — not as temperature but as space, the particular way the Monitor's Space-element operated: expanding the distance between things, making the air feel larger and emptier than it was.

"She spaces," Goatpus said, his bill raised, reading the field. "She doesn't freeze. She expands. Everything gets further apart."

Goobat felt it in his chest — the space between his inhale and his exhale growing. The space between one thought and the next. He tried to sing a note to test his voice and found the note, but the note had nowhere to go; the air between his mouth and the world was too wide.

JoSmith was already metabolising the cold, working fast, absorbing the Space-element at the boundaries of the group. "I can hold her off from two of us," he said, his voice tight with the effort. "Not three."

Goatpus slipped into the water-table beneath the ground without a word, and Goobat was alone with JoSmith and the Monitor's cold, and JoSmith was already looking at his paws because the cold was inside him now too, metabolised but not neutralised, and the space was growing.

Goobat took a step toward the north to meet it.

"Don't," JoSmith said.

"If I go to her she doesn't have to expand to reach me," Goobat said. "Less damage to the village."

"She'll take you."

"Yes," Goobat said. "But two hours is already gone. He'll be back soon."

JoSmith looked at him with the expression of someone running the calculation and not liking the result. "I'm coming with you," he said.

"You're staying here," Goobat said. "So there's someone to tell TheKanter where I went."

He walked north.

## IV. The Cold Space

The Monitor was larger than the Serpent and quieter. She emerged from her crystalline plain as a structure rather than a creature — four limbs, a long body, a tail, all of it armoured in frost so old it had calcified into something harder than ice. She moved like geography.

She looked at Goobat and he felt every space in his body widen. The space between his ribs. The space between his teeth. The space in the centre of his chest where the Image and the Song lived together; that widened too, and suddenly they were not together, they were two separate things on opposite sides of an expanding void, and he felt what a Sovereign must feel — holding image in one hand, song in the other, the crossing not happening because the distance between them was too great.

He could think. He could not move.

"You know about crossing," the Monitor said. Her voice was the sound of ice contracting in extreme cold — a crack, a precision, a sound that implied enormous force applied to a very small point. "Tell me how."

"You need both together," Goobat said. His voice came out thin. "Image and Song. Simultaneously."

"I know that," she said. "I have tried. They will not be simultaneous."

"Because the cold keeps them apart," Goobat said. He was standing in her territory, spacing spreading through him, and he understood her problem exactly because he was experiencing it. "When the space in you is too large, nothing can be held close to anything else."

She looked at him with the flat attention of someone who has been told the shape of their problem but not the solution.

"You came willingly," she said.

"The village was in the way," Goobat said.

She considered him for a long moment. Then she did the thing she did with things she wanted to study: she spaced him into stillness and carried him north.

## V. TheKanter in the Cold

He found JoSmith outside the village with ash on his fur and a story that took thirty seconds to tell.

TheKanter looked north. The crystalline plain caught the light and threw it back hard and flat. He could not see the Monitor's territory from here, only the edge of it — the line where the world changed from scorched middle-ground to frozen white.

"My fire won't work in there," he said.

"No," JoSmith said.

"How cold is it?"

"Your fire goes out within thirty paces of the boundary," JoSmith said. "I metabolised some of it on the way back. It's the kind of cold that makes fire forget it's fire."

TheKanter looked at his hands. The specific fire he carried was not decorative — it was structural, it was how he understood himself. A Kangaroo without fire was still a Kangaroo, but it was a Kangaroo with a piece missing.

"Is there another way?" he asked.

"Kinetic energy doesn't need fire," JoSmith said. "It needs mass and speed. You still have those."

"Hitting a frozen plain won't—"

"Not hitting it," JoSmith said. "Resonating it. Everything has a frequency it breaks at. The Monitor's plain is crystal. Crystal has resonant frequencies. If you leap at the right intervals, the right pattern, you generate a seismic vibration at the frequency the crystal wants to shatter at. Not force — rhythm."

TheKanter looked at his feet. He had been landing in patterns his whole life — the Circuit was about pattern, not impact. He understood pattern.

"How do I find the right rhythm?"

"You'll feel it," JoSmith said. "When the pattern is right, the ground will start to hum before you land."

TheKanter went north.

The fire went out within thirty paces of the boundary, exactly as predicted. He kept going. He was cold in a way he had never been cold before — not uncomfortable cold, but architectural cold, the cold that rearranges things. He could feel himself becoming slower and more rigid and he concentrated on the pattern instead of the sensation.

He began to leap.

Not high — flat, lateral, the perimeter Circuit, but larger. He could hear the plain beneath him: silence on the first pass, a very faint ringing on the second, a hum developing on the third that was not coming from him but from the crystal itself, responding. He adjusted the interval. The hum deepened. He adjusted again. On the seventh pass the plain cracked in a hairline that ran north for thirty lengths, and in the crack the temperature rose ten degrees — not from his fire, which was out, but from the released compression of the crystal itself.

Goobat, two hundred paces north in the Monitor's territory, felt the vibration through the spacing that held him still. The Monitor felt it too, and turned from studying Goobat to study the plain, and in the moment she turned Goobat pulled his arms to his chest, compressing himself against her spacing, and sang the single lowest note he had — not a world-note, just a wombat-note, the ground-frequency of his own body — and it went into the crack in the plain and ran north and the plain cracked further.

## VI. What the War Was About

The Monitor held her territory together by force of attention. When the attention split — Goobat singing, the plain fracturing, TheKanter's rhythm shaking the crystal from the south — the spacing collapsed, and Goobat fell to his knees on real ground, and the Monitor turned back to him with something new in her face, which was that she was losing control of her plain and she knew it.

"Stop," she said.

"I'm not doing it," Goobat said. "He's doing it. I told you he'd be back."

She looked at him. The Serpent was coming too — he had seen TheKanter enter the Monitor's territory and his fire was building from the south because his fire always built when something large was happening, he couldn't help it.

"They're going to meet in your territory," Goobat said. "Serpent from the south, Kangaroo from the inside. That's a lot of fire in a cold place."

The Monitor's plain shuddered.

"What do you want?" she said.

"Tell me why the war started," Goobat said. "The real reason. Not the accumulated reason. The first one."

The Monitor was quiet for a moment. Around her the plain shook and cracked and the sound of TheKanter's circuit came closer.

"His fire got away from him," she said. "He was young. His fire was always getting away from him. He burned my nursery." The words came out flat, clinical, the way you speak about things you've spoken about in your own head ten thousand times. "All my eggs. Forty-three eggs. The whole clutch. Gone."

"Does he know?" Goobat asked.

"He knows he burned the nursery."

"Does he know what was in it?"

She looked at him.

"Does he know about the forty-three eggs?" Goobat asked.

The plain was silent for three seconds.

"I never told him," she said, as if this had not occurred to her until this moment.

## VII. The Thing That Ended the War

TheKanter emerged from the cracked plain and the Serpent came from the south and they stood in the Monitor's territory looking at each other across twenty lengths of distance and the Monitor stood between them with Goobat beside her and everything was very still.

"He doesn't know about the eggs," Goobat said to the Serpent.

The Serpent looked at him. Then at the Monitor. His fire was very low.

"Tell him," Goobat said to her. "Tell him what was in the nursery."

She told him.

The Serpent's fire, which had been burning continuously for three generations, did something it had not done in three generations: it guttered. Not out — guttered. The way a fire does when something large lands on it from above, smothering the oxygen, leaving the embers.

"Forty-three," he said.

"Yes," she said.

"I didn't know," he said.

"I know you didn't know," she said. Her voice had changed — it was still cold but it was a different cold, the cold of a thing that has been refrigerated for a long time and has just been taken out and is slowly coming to the temperature of the room it's in. "I never told you because I couldn't say it without wanting to end you. And then it became too late to say it without acknowledging that I had been punishing you for something you didn't fully understand." She paused. "Which made me the one who—"

"Yes," the Serpent said. "It did."

They looked at each other across Goobat's channel — the small trench he had dug between their territories, water already seeping into it from the ice-melt, finding its level.

"I burned your nursery," the Serpent said. "I did not know what was in it. I am sorry for what was in it."

"I punished you for three generations for something you didn't fully understand," the Monitor said. "I am sorry for those generations."

Neither of them looked satisfied. That was right. Goobat had not expected them to look satisfied. He expected them to look like creatures who have finally said the true thing and are discovering that the true thing is not a cure, just a foundation — the first thing that can actually be built on.

## VIII. The Doctrine

*Suffering is diagnostic, not moral. It reveals what is out of balance and what was never resolved. The fire that burned the nursery was real. The grief was real. The war was a misdirection of both — using real pain to justify a punishment that could never be adequate because nothing could give back the forty-three eggs. Ask what is out of balance. Ask what was never said. The diagnosis comes before the treatment.*

He had been physically paralysed in the Monitor's territory and in the paralysis he had felt the Image and the Song separate — two real things, torn apart by space. He knew what that felt like now. He knew what the Sovereigns had been trying to rebuild with their machine, and why it couldn't work, and why he had to hold the space between Image and Song himself, with his own body, with his own willingness to let them coexist in the same heart.

He needed to be warmer than the Monitor's cold. Not by fire. Just by being present in a way that refused to space.

## IX. Opening the Fourth Doorway

He held the image of the Mirror Maze — endless reflections, a creature that had learned to perfectly repeat the thing it loved most and had forgotten that repetition is not the thing.

He felt the frequency: the hall-of-mirrors tone, every note doubled, no original source.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Scorpion Desert was changing. Not healed — changing. The King Brown's fire moving with direction rather than overflow. The Monitor's cold pulling back toward its proper extent, the crystal plain melting at the edges into the river that Goobat's channel had begun.

They stepped through to the Mirror Maze.
