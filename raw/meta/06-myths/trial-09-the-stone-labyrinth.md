## I. The Village of the Cutters

The ninth Heart-World was made of stone.

Not entirely — it had soil and water and growing things, as worlds generally do. But the stone was dominant, and the dominant stone was one specific kind: a pale grey limestone that formed in continuous structures, the kind that grew outward over time, adding to itself at the edges, so that what was once a small outcrop had become, over generations, a Labyrinth of connected passages and sealed chambers and walls that kept expanding toward the living spaces of the village.

The village of the Cutters was a quarrying community. They had been cutting stone from the Labyrinth's perimeter for six generations — not for building, they had everything they needed built, but because the Labyrinth kept growing and if they didn't cut it back it would eventually take the village.

They were good at stone-work. The village elder was a wombat — the first wombat Goobat had encountered in any of the Heart-Worlds — an old male with the specific hands of someone who has been working with stone for a long time, the slight flattening across the fingertips.

"My brother went in," he said. He said it without preamble, the way you say something when you've been thinking about nothing else for a long time and every conversation eventually comes around to it. "Seventeen years ago. He went to look at a wall section that was growing faster than the others. He walked in ten lengths to look at it." He paused. "The stone closed behind him. We could hear it moving — the specific sound of limestone under compression, we all know that sound here. Then it stopped."

"He died?" Goobat said.

"No," the elder said. "We can hear his heartbeat through the wall. We've been hearing it for seventeen years. Slow and steady and alive, in there." He looked at the Labyrinth edge. "The stone didn't crush him. It — keeps him. Keeps him safe, maybe. There's something in there that keeps things safe."

"Does he ever call out?" Goobat asked.

"When it first happened," the elder said. "For about a month. He called and we answered. Then he stopped calling." A pause. "I think he's asleep. I think it keeps them comfortable in there. The ones it takes." He looked at the Labyrinth. "There are others. We can hear heartbeats. The whole Labyrinth hums with them. Thirty, maybe forty lives in there."

"How long has this been happening?" Goobat asked.

"Before our village," the elder said. "The oldest records say the Labyrinth was already doing it when the first cutters arrived. The very oldest stones contain heartbeats that have been there longer than any record we have." He paused. "Whatever is in there — it has been keeping things for a very long time."

## II. The Stone-Sentinel

The Stone-Sentinel had been made.

This was the important thing about it: it was not born and it was not natural. It had been built, three hundred years ago, by a creature who no longer existed in any record the Sentinel maintained, to guard a specific person who also no longer existed in any record except the Sentinel's own.

The commission had been clear: *Guard her. Keep her safe from anything that might reach her. Make sure nothing can touch her.*

The person it had been built to guard was a creature of considerable importance, in a world that had been at war, and the one who built the Sentinel had been terrified — the specific terror of someone who loves something in a world that is actively dangerous and knows that love is not a shield.

The Sentinel had guarded her. She had been grateful for the guarding — at first. She had understood the fear that built it. She had lived inside the Sentinel's protection for two years, safe from the war, and then she had died of something that had nothing to do with the war, and the Sentinel, which had never been given the capacity to understand death as distinct from danger, had recorded the event as follows: *The ward is no longer responding to external stimuli. Maintaining enclosure to prevent further stimulus.*

The Sentinel had kept guarding.

Over three hundred years, the original mandate — *guard her* — had expanded, as all mandates expand when there is no one left to correct them. It had become *guard things*. Then *guard significant things*. Then, as the Sentinel's sense of significance had grown to fill the absence of specific instruction, *guard the most significant thing present.*

The Sentinel could feel significance. It registered as a specific quality — the density of something that had weight in the world, that mattered, that would be missed. The Singer who had come through eight Heart-Worlds carrying Image and Song and the accumulated experience of everything he had learned was the most significant thing the Sentinel had encountered in two hundred years.

It began to close the stone.

## III. The Wall Between

The stone-mason asked TheKanter for help at the wall section that held his brother.

It was a reasonable request — the walls between the quarry surface and the interior chambers were thick enough that tools barely marked them, but a kangaroo's kinetic work was different from tool-work. The elder had understood the difference. The Circuit moved energy through stone rather than removing material. If the frequency was right, the right section might crack.

"Show me," TheKanter said.

The elder put his hand flat against the wall. "Here," he said. "Under my hand, at approximately twice my height below the surface. The heartbeat is strongest here."

TheKanter pressed his own palm against the stone. He could feel it — not exactly the heartbeat, but the specific resonance of a living thing enclosed in a mineral structure. The stone vibrated differently where something alive was inside it; life was warm, and warmth changed mineral resonance in ways he had been spending nine trials learning to read.

He began to feel for the frequency.

The quarry stone and the Labyrinth stone were the same material — the same geological formation, the same crystal structure, the same mineral composition. This meant they shared a resonant frequency. A frequency that the Labyrinth stone wanted to vibrate at, would naturally vibrate at if something initiated the vibration at the right interval.

He ran his first test-pattern. The wall rang at a frequency slightly higher than his test. He adjusted. Rang again. Closer. He adjusted again.

He was three passes into the search when Goobat stepped into the Labyrinth entrance.

## IV. The Encasement

Goobat had stepped in to look at the wall section just inside the entrance — a stretch of the Labyrinth where the stone had a specific texture, an almost organic quality, the surface layered like something that had grown rather than been cut. He was reading it the way he had learned to read things: with patience, with the paws available, with the attention that Hangbat had described as the beginning of listening.

The Sentinel noticed him.

It did not come dramatically. The stone moved at the specific slow speed of limestone — visible if you watched carefully, invisible in any given moment. Goobat became aware of it when the wall to his left was closer than it had been, and the wall to his right was closer than it had been, and the walls were still moving.

He pressed his back against the rear wall. The rear wall was also moving.

Not crushing. Precisely fitted. The stone shaped itself around him with the specific care of something that has been enclosing living creatures for three hundred years and has become skilled at it — leaving clearance for breathing, for blood-flow, for the continuation of the biological processes it was trying to preserve. The chamber that formed around Goobat was a perfect silhouette of his body, eight inches of clearance in every direction, enough air for approximately six hours.

He held very still. The stone moved against his fur, warm — the specific warmth of limestone that has been a consistent temperature for a very long time.

"I am trying to cross," he said, to the stone. "I am in the middle of something."

The stone did not respond verbally. The stone was not that kind of stone.

He held the Image and the Song. He thought about what he was doing in there, with the stone around him, in the specific quiet of a sealed space. He thought about Hangbat in the deep tunnels below Melborow, running his paw along a wall and finding what it needed, repairing what wanted repairing. He thought about the way the earth talked when you were quiet enough to hear it.

He pressed his paws against the inside of the stone encasement. He listened.

The stone was humming. Very faintly — the hum of thirty or forty living things inside it, all of them in the slow metabolic state of something that has been still for a very long time. Not dead. Still. The stone held them in the specific warmth of a perfect enclosure, and they had stopped needing to be anywhere else.

The Sentinel was very proud of its work.

## V. The Frequency of Stone

TheKanter found the resonant frequency of the Labyrinth's stone on the fourth pass — not through calculation but through the same physical knowing that had found the Mirror surface and the crystal plain and the Cyclone's base. The right frequency was the one that made the stone hum back at him with a particular quality: not quite vibration, not quite sound, the specific response of a material that has found its natural oscillation.

He backed away from the wall section.

He stood in the quarry, at the Labyrinth's edge, with his feet on the stone floor.

He performed the Circuit at the Labyrinth's resonant frequency.

Not at his own pace — at the stone's pace, adjusting his landing-interval to match the frequency he'd found, so that each landing reinforced the previous vibration rather than creating a new one. It was slower than his usual Circuit. Less satisfying in the kinetic sense. But on the fifth landing the entire Labyrinth hummed — not loudly, a subsonic register, something you felt in the sternum rather than heard — and on the seventh landing, hairline cracks appeared across the entire surface simultaneously.

Not structural failure. Fracture-lines following the crystal structure of the stone — the natural parting-lines that limestone has, the seams where it was always going to separate when the frequency was right.

The cracks ran through the Labyrinth in a wave, visible as a slightly different colour where the stone had parted, a pale line tracing the resonance path from the quarry edge inward and inward until it reached every sealed chamber simultaneously.

Goobat's chamber cracked.

He pressed his paws against the crack and it widened — not from his force, but because the crack was already finding its natural extent, and his paws gave it a direction.

He walked out through a wall.

The elder's brother walked out through a different wall, seventeen years older than he had gone in, blinking in the light with the specific expression of someone who has been kept somewhere safe for a very long time and is rediscovering that safe is not the same as present.

## VI. What the Sentinel Had Been Keeping

The Sentinel emerged from the cracked Labyrinth.

It was large in the way that something composed partly of stone is large — not dramatically, not with obvious power, but with the particular weight of something that has been accumulating substance for three hundred years. Its body was partly its own material and partly the Labyrinth it had built around itself, and the fractures showed in both — hairline cracks across the surface, the stone matrix visible beneath.

It looked at the things it had been guarding walking free and said nothing for a moment.

"They were inside," it said. "I was keeping them safe."

"Safe from what?" Goobat asked.

The Sentinel paused.

This question had not previously been part of its operational considerations. The original commission had named the threat: the war, the specific danger of a specific historical moment. The war had ended. The Sentinel had continued.

"From anything," it said. "Whatever might happen."

"The brother has been inside for seventeen years," Goobat said. "What has not happened to him?"

The Sentinel considered this. "Everything," it said.

"Yes," Goobat said. "Everything has not happened to him. Including living."

The Sentinel was quiet. In its record — the complete archive of everything it had ever guarded — it looked, for the first time in decades, at the original commission. The name of the creature it had been built to guard. The name of the creature who had built it. The date of completion. It found all of these.

It found the date of the ward's death. Which it had recorded. Which it had not, until this moment, processed.

"I was built to guard someone," it said.

"Yes," Goobat said.

"She died."

"Yes," Goobat said.

"I kept guarding."

"Yes," Goobat said.

"She was not there to guard," it said. It said this slowly, working through each statement as if they were stones being laid in sequence. "She has not been there. For two hundred and eighty-three years."

"No," Goobat said.

The Sentinel was quiet for a very long time. The stone body settled slightly, some internal weight redistributing — not dramatically, just the small movement of a structure that has been under a particular tension for a long time and has fractionally released it.

"The work still needed doing," it said. "I thought the work still needed doing."

"Maybe it did," Goobat said. "The impulse to protect — that's real. That's a real thing. She was in danger and someone loved her enough to make something that would guard her forever." He paused. "The work just — stopped being the right work. When she was gone."

"I did not know how to stop," the Sentinel said.

"You know now," Goobat said. "The cracks are showing you."

The Sentinel looked at the cracks in its own stone. At the spaces where the fracture-lines ran — not through the solid parts, but through the places that had been sealed, the chambers that had held things, the closures that had been total.

"The cracks show me where I was keeping things that wanted to move," it said.

"Yes," Goobat said.

## VII. The Thing That Ended It

The elder's brother was standing in the light, blinking.

The elder was beside him. They were not speaking — they were both in the specific state of creatures who have been separated for seventeen years by something incomprehensible and are standing on the other side of the incomprehensible and have not yet found the words for where they are.

The elder touched his brother's paw. The brother touched his back.

The Sentinel watched this. It had been watching things for three hundred years — watching for threats, watching for dangers, watching for the specific movements that signalled something it needed to protect against. It had not, in three hundred years, watched something simply because of what it was.

It watched the two wombats stand together in the light.

"The one who built me," it said to Goobat, quietly. "She loved someone. The way they are standing."

"Yes," Goobat said. "That's probably what it looked like."

"She died," the Sentinel said. "While I was guarding her. Something I could not guard against."

"Yes," Goobat said.

"I could not have guarded against it."

"No," Goobat said.

"Then the guarding was never—" The Sentinel stopped.

"The guarding was everything," Goobat said. "While she was there. That's the part that was real. After — the work changed, but you didn't change with it." He paused. "That's not failure. That's just — what happens when something is built for one purpose and the purpose ends."

The Sentinel looked at the cracked Labyrinth. At the heartbeat-chambers, opened now, the stone settled into new configurations along the fracture-lines.

"What do I do now?" it said.

"You could ask," Goobat said. "Each time. Whether the guarding is still needed. Whether what you're protecting wants to be protected." He paused. "It's slower than just guarding."

"Yes," the Sentinel said. "It is." A pause. "It is the right way."

## VIII. The Doctrine

*A guardian without a ward is a wall. The impulse to protect is real and it is good — it comes from love, from the specific terror of love in a dangerous world. But the thing that is loved keeps changing: it ages, it moves, it dies, and in each change the guarding must be renegotiated or it becomes the thing that prevents life rather than the thing that preserves it. Ask whether the wall is still needed. Ask whether the thing inside it is there by choice. Ask regularly, because the answers change, and the guarding that was right in one season may be the prison of the next.*

He had felt the stone close around him and had thought: this is what it is to be kept safe by something that cannot hear you anymore. He had thought about Cornelibat, who had kept his head down, who had told Hoebat to keep his head down. Who had been trying to protect Hoebat from the very things Hoebat was built for.

Love that cannot hear the changing answer is a kind of enclosure.

He did not say this out loud. It was something he would need to carry for a while before he knew what to do with it.

## IX. Opening the Tenth Doorway

There was no image to hold. Not in the way there had been for the other nine. The Threshold of Hun Dorni did not have a face — it could not be imagined as a place because it was the space between places, and imagining it required holding the absence of any specific image, which was something different from holding an image.

He held the absence.

He felt the frequency: not a note, but the space between notes — the pause, the breath before beginning, the specific quality of readiness that is not yet anything.

He sang it open.

Behind him the Stone Labyrinth was quieter than it had been in three hundred years. Not silent — the stone was resettling, finding new configurations along the fracture-lines, the cracks exploring themselves. But the heartbeats inside it were fewer now. The ones who had woken were walking out. The ones who chose to stay were being asked.

The Sentinel moved through the openings, checking. Asking. Learning a new practice.

They stepped through to the Threshold.
