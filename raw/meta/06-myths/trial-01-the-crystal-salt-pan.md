## I. Arrival

The plain had once held water. The ground still said so — in the pale cracked skin of the flat where the last water had gathered and gone, in the dead channels tracing their remembered courses through the flat, in the particular quality of the cold, which was not weather but residue, the cold of a place that has been scoured of what it was and left with the shape of the absence.

They came down from the Node onto the salt and stopped.

The sky above them was the same white as the ground below, and the horizon was the seam where they met without distinction. The light came from everywhere and illuminated nothing — flattened the shadows, cancelled depth, left objects standing in the flat white as if they had been placed.

Goapus crouched at the plain's edge, bill pressed to the ground. The bill is a sensing organ — it reads current, temperature, the faint electrical signature of what moves beneath the surface. It does not require water to work. It requires contact. He held it to the salt for a long moment, his whole body still, flat tail heavy on the crust behind him, the dark fur of his face close to the white ground. Then he looked up. His eyes, small and set high, carried what he had found.

"Very old. Something in the deep substrate still holds the memory of it. The memory is distressed."

Across the flat, barely audible at this distance, the singing.

Not a note — a song, full and shifting, the kind that changes before you have finished hearing what it was a moment ago. Hauntingly beautiful in the specific way of things that are almost but not quite recognisable: you could follow a phrase of it and feel that you understood it, and then it would fold into something else, something adjacent, and the understanding would not quite carry. The lyrics — if they were lyrics — were in no language any of them had encountered. They might have been a language. They might have been something with the structure of language without the content, the way a dream has a narrative without continuity. The song did not repeat. It built on itself, each phrase a variation of the one before, opening outward the way a fractal opens — always more of the same pattern, never arriving at an edge.

Chewbat turned toward it without deciding to. His chest opened, briefly, toward the sound — the specific, involuntary opening that a harmony of that quality produces in a singer's body, the way light produces a reflex in the eye. Then the part of him that was not his chest closed the opening again, quietly. He was compact in the way wombats are compact: low-slung, dense, built for endurance rather than speed. His fur was the dark grey-brown of deep country, and he held his weight as singers hold their weight — centred, dropped, the breath available at any moment. His paws settled at his sides.

"Don't follow it," Jeosmi said.

"I wasn't going to," Chewbat said.

"You were considering it."

"I was considering not considering it."

Tekanter had moved to the edge of one of the dry channels, his gold eyes tracking the horizon. The gold was not the warm colour of metal or morning light but something further into the spectrum, the gold of a fire's core, and it moved in his irises when he was attending to something. His tail, iron-tipped, hung behind him with the specific weight of something that had been trained into use. The fire he carried was internal — visible at the eyes when it rose, felt at the skin of whatever he touched when it was running high. He stood at the channel's edge with his back to the singing and his eyes east.

"There's smoke east. Real smoke, not salt haze. Which means something is burning something, which means there's a village." He looked back at them. "Also I am deeply thirsty. Can we."

They went east.

The singing did not get quieter as they moved away from it. It stayed at the same distance — not louder, not softer, always just at the edge of what could be made out. Not following them. Simply remaining present, the way a smell remains in a room after the source of it is gone.

## II. Mallee

The village sat at the plain's edge in low depressions, each dwelling built downward into the ground rather than upward from it — walls of pale earth packed smooth, doorways rounded, thresholds worn to a clean concavity by years of careful feet. No ornamentation on the outside. Inside, the walls were marked with careful lines: the choir's accumulated notation, generation over generation, the score of the water-song pressed into the plaster with a tool passed down so many times the marks of the hands that had held it were worked into the wood. Verses older than anyone living, in a script that had not changed in two hundred years.

The inhabitants moved through the lanes with a care that had become habit — the particular unhurriedness of a community that has learned to treat the ground it stands on as if it might go away. They watched the travellers arrive from the edges of doorways and from the tops of the low walls, their faces holding something that was closer to a calculation than to hostility.

An elderly bilby named Mallee met them at the first dwelling. She was small even by bilby standards, her ears long and paper-thin with age, the veins in them visible against the late light. The fur at her muzzle had gone silver and fine. Her movements were exact — she poured the broth without looking at what she was doing, her eyes already on the travellers.

She told them about the water first. An underground well, still good, but she needed help before she could share it. This she said without apology.

"There was a choir," she said. "Forty voices. They sang to the water spirit — she kept the river full, the rains reliable. When the full choir sang, she answered." She set down her cup. "Two months ago, a bilby named Mulga took most of the village away with him. Into the mountains. Without the choir's full number the spirit stopped answering."

"Took them how?" Jeosmi said.

"Convinced them. That the spirit was gone. That the choir was singing for nothing." She looked at the table.

"And were they?" Chewbat asked.

She didn't answer that directly. "Creatures go missing from the village," she said. "In the night. Some come back. The ones who come back are — " She stopped at the word, turned it over. "Quieter."

"How much quieter," Chewbat said.

She looked at him. Then she looked at the daughter in the corner.

The daughter was sitting with her face to the wall, her spine very straight, her ears up and tracking nothing — tracking nothing in the way that ears track when there is nothing left in them to direct. Her fur was pale at the edges with something that was not dust. She had been sitting in that position, by the marks on the floor around her, for some time. Her mouth was slightly open. The sound that came from it was very quiet, and it was the sound of the plain.

No one said anything.

"What do you need us to do with Mulga?" Tekanter said. He had been standing in the doorway, and he had seen enough.

"Remove him," she said. "Bring the others back. Restore the choir's number."

Tekanter and Goapus exchanged a look.

"I'll go," Tekanter said.

---

## III. The Mountain

The range rose sheer from the plain's eastern edge, red rock gone dark in the cooling air, the ridgelines jagged against the white sky. Tekanter crossed it in long leaps — each one covering ground that would have taken an hour on foot, the fire flaring briefly at the peak of each arc, visible in the gold of his eyes even at distance, the iron-tipped tail trailing behind him in the cold. He found the lair by the sounds coming out of it. He announced himself to the two guards at the entrance in the way he usually announced himself to guards, which left them sitting against the rock wall with their weapons beside them and their eyes on the middle distance, and called out for whoever was in charge.

The leader came out.

He was a bilby. The size of a boot. He came without weapons and without hesitation, and his face had the look of someone who has been waiting for something like this to arrive and is almost relieved that it has. His fur was the dark grey of the mountain rock, worn close to the body. Around his waist he wore a cord of twisted plant fibre from which hung a series of small flat stones, each one marked with a different sign in pale pigment — a record of something, or a calling card. They clicked softly when he moved.

They fought.

Mulga was matched to Tekanter blow for blow in a way that had no justification in the relative sizes of their bodies. The first strike Tekanter threw was absorbed and returned before he had finished it — not deflected, not dodged, but received and sent back with its own weight added. He adjusted. The second exchange was the same. So was the third. A boot-sized bilby returning a kangaroo's full force with an economy of movement that belongs to someone who has been doing this for a very long time in a very large variety of circumstances.

It lasted six exchanges. The bilby fought with precision rather than power — tracking where the weight was going before it arrived, finding the angles, never opposing force directly. No wasted movement, no announcement, each response arriving before Tekanter had finished the action it was responding to. Tekanter fought with controlled fire and mass, watching for the pattern in the bilby's movement, not finding one. They stopped at the same moment, four paces apart, taking each other's measure. Both slightly winded. Neither damaged.

Tekanter swung his tail. The bilby moved under it, fast, but not quite fast enough — the tail grazed the fur at the back of his neck. In the fraction of a second it took to pass, Tekanter saw the mark: interlocked circles on the skin at the neck's base, old ink, the lines worn smooth where the fur had moved over them for years. He would have known the design from fifty paces in poor light. He carried the same mark himself, pressed into the skin below his collarbone on the morning he took the oath — the cold of the instrument, the elder's hands, the specific words said over him while the mark was made, which he has not repeated to anyone. The mark of the Order of Discerning Eye. Visible now in the stillness between them.

The Order was not founded as a fighting order, though many of its members fight. It was founded to carry what was witnessed without distortion across difficult ground. The oath was exact: *I will report what I find. I will not report what I did not find.* The mark pressed it into the body so the body could not forget. Lie, and the power the oath had given drained back through the place the lie had passed. Speak falsely enough and you emptied yourself entirely. No one who held the mark chose their words lightly. The order had no politics. Its members were on every side of every divide. He had met eleven of them in his life, before today.

Tekanter put down his guard, drew back the fur at the inside of his foreleg, and showed Mulga the same mark. The bilby went still in the way of someone recalibrating everything they had just done. Then he put away his weapons and sat down.

The bilbies brought out a table hewn from red rock and set it in the entrance of the lair where the last of the afternoon light came in at an angle, catching the dust in the air and turning it gold. They brought tea in clay vessels, the glaze cracked and repaired with dark resin that left fine lines across the surface like old scarring. The two of them sat across from each other in the cold of the mountain lair and after a moment began to talk — not about the plain yet, but about the Order: teachers they had each known, what it had cost to carry true things through difficult ground, the specific conversation of two people who have taken the same oath and found each other unexpectedly in a hard place.

---

## IV. The True Account

There was no rebellion.

The village had been taken — in the night, by shadows. Black energy, binding around their bodies and moving them. The bilbies taken were not able to scream. They moved in silence and in the specific horror of a body that has been made to move without being asked to. A week later, groups of them were found arranged in formation on the salt plain, faces to the sky, mouths open, sound coming through their throats without any of them choosing to make it. Mulga's group had been pulling survivors out for two months. The rescued came back with less than they had left with. He couldn't say what the less was. It moved differently in their eyes.

"What about the water spirit," Tekanter asked.

Mulga looked at him steadily. "We are bilbies," he said. "We have no spirits between us and the ground. We are attuned to the land directly — not through any presence that mediates on our behalf. The water came because the water came. We asked the ground for what it had. When it had it, we were grateful. That is the whole of it, and no spirit lives in it."

Tekanter waited.

"The old bilby," he said. "Mallee. The village at the plain's edge. The story about you leading the rebellion."

Mulga looked at him. "There is no village at the plain's edge," he said. "There hasn't been for two months."

The cold of it arrived before the thought did — the specific cold that comes when information rearranges everything adjacent to it. Tekanter was already moving before he had finished understanding why.

---

## V. The Dry Riverbed

He ran back the way he had come, the plain opening before him in its flat white extent, the dead channels crossing his path, the salt breaking under his feet at every landing, the sky above the same white as the ground below so that he moved through a space that had no top and no bottom, only direction.

There was no village.

Goapus and Jeosmi lay on the cracked mud of the old riverbed, breathing, coming back from whatever had been in the broth. The depression where the dwelling had stood held only the outline of its foundations in the crust — precise edges already smoothing where the wind worked on them. Chewbat was not there.

Tekanter waited while they came back to themselves. He said what needed to be said once Jeosmi's eyes had focused and Goapus had managed to sit up, and there was nearly a fight at the end of it, and then he walked away from the fight because the alternative was hitting Goapus and he was not going to do that.

He stood fifty paces off at the edge of the old channel and made himself breathe.

Jeosmi came up beside him. "I know," he said.

"You were drugged."

"I know."

"Both of you."

"I know, Tekanter."

The wind moved across the flat. The singing came with it — faint, sourceless, perfect from a distance.

"Mulga's camp," Jeosmi said. "Two ridges east. If anyone knows how the entrances to these lairs are marked—"

"I'll go," Tekanter said.

"I was suggesting we go together."

"I'll go," Tekanter said again. He meant something different by it the second time.

Jeosmi went back to help Goapus stand.

---

## VI. The Garden

The outcast bilbies at Mulga's camp gave him one useful piece of information: the entrances were marked with a circle of singing bilbies around the fissure.

He walked the plain for three hours. The Choir's harmonic was everywhere, embedded in the salt itself, sourceless, not coming from any direction so much as emanating from the ground. He followed not the sound but the direction it came *from*, which is a different kind of listening and requires a different kind of patience, both of which he had.

He found the ring.

The bilbies in it were not singing in the way that a singer chooses to sing. They were singing the way a struck bell makes sound — continuously, without variation, because they had been made to resonate and had not been given a way to stop. He called out to them. He called again, louder. He stepped through the circle and put his hand on the shoulder of the nearest one.

Nothing in them heard him.

He looked at what he was standing in the middle of.

The formation ran from this point outward to every horizon — five arms burned into the salt, each a trench of darker crust, black-edged, deliberate at a scale that required centuries rather than hands. Five sections. In each section, in concentric arcs, in radial lines, in spirals requiring a patience that bodies do not naturally contain —

He stood very still for a moment.

They were not formations.

They were what was left of bodies that had been standing in those positions long enough for the salt to take them. From the outside in, crystallising the surface first and moving inward through the years. The oldest were white and featureless as the plain around them, their outlines dissolved into the crust — findable only by the slight mounding where the accumulation was thickest, a few inches of height separating the gathered salt from the flat ground around it. The newer ones still held faces. The mouths were open. At the edges of the mouths, the salt was beginning its work — a faint white thickening along the lips, a stillness in the jaw that was not the stillness of living bodies. The sound passing through them had the same quality as the sound passing through the bilbies in the ring — continuous, precise, no one inside choosing it. Two hundred of them. More, further out, older, further along.

At the centre of each section, embedded in the crust: a cluster of small sealed glass jars, cold to the touch even in the open air, the blue inside them moving faintly when the light hit at an angle.

At the formation's heart: a fissure in the salt. Cold rising from it, steady.

He went in.

---

## VII. The Descent

He fought all the way down — wall to wall in the narrow passage, the iron-tipped tail feeling out the dark ahead of his eyes, his body occupying the space so completely that there was no room left in it for anything that wanted him stopped. The things that came at him in the passage had the quality of a system defending itself rather than creatures choosing to fight, which he found, in some ways, more disturbing than creatures who chose. Malice has a temperature. These had none.

He reached the cave floor.

He stood in it and took in what he could see: jars, shelves, cold, blue light from the jars running to the far dark and beyond. Glass coffins along the far wall, each fitted with a tube, each tube running to a jar above it.

Then the black energy came.

Not from a direction. From the concept of all directions simultaneously, and the crystal formed at his wrists before he had processed what was happening. He continued to fight. He fought until the crystal had closed around every point of leverage his body had to offer, and then he stood in it, breathing, cataloguing.

He had his eyes. He had his fire, held in. The chains would heat before he would, if it came to that. He filed this under: *available, not yet.*

He waited.

Goapus and Jeosmi had followed at the necessary distance. They had seen the black energy take him. They had assessed it correctly and had not come in. He would have made the same call. He noted this and did not feel better about it.

---

## VIII. The Testimony

They went back to Mulga's camp.

One of the survivors was there — a bilby, recovered enough to speak, sitting with the particular stillness of someone who is conserving something they are no longer sure they have enough of. Goapus sat beside her and said nothing for a long time, which was his method when something needed room. Eventually the room was enough.

"The glass coffin is smooth," she said. "The right size. The air is good."

Jeosmi had closed his eyes.

"She adds salt to the air each morning. Measured. Calibrated. While it settles she speaks — quietly, and very precisely — each thing in you that is still turned toward something absent. Each reach. Each waiting place."

"What does she say?" Goapus asked.

"What's there," the bilby said. "She finds it and she says it and when she says it, it rises. To where the salt is. And the salt holds it." She looked at her paws. "The third day your memories begin coming forward on their own. Without being asked. In order."

Silence.

"By the fifth day I understood that I had been making it harder than it needed to be."

Jeosmi opened his eyes.

"The seventh day there was nothing left that wanted anything," she said. "My body was there. It stood when it was asked to stand. It sang when it was asked to sing." She looked up at Goapus with an expression that was not quite an expression, the way a drawing of a face is not quite a face. "I don't know what left. I don't have words for what left. She was — "

"Thorough," Goapus said.

"She was very thorough," the bilby agreed.

Goapus and Jeosmi went out onto the ridge and stood in the open cold with the plain below them and the fissure somewhere at its centre and Tekanter in it, in chains, with his fire held in.

"Well," Jeosmi said.

"Yes," Goapus said.

"I have an idea."

"I was waiting for that."

---

## IX. The Ruse

"You're going to become a bilby," Jeosmi said.

"I know," Goapus said. He was already attending to it — not performing the change but attending to it the way you attend to something that requires accuracy rather than effort. A true becoming, not mimicry, which meant entering fully into the bilby's specific quality of being in the world: the hollow rhythm, the salt-dust in the fur, the metabolic signature of a creature that had been in the plain's proximity long enough to begin its dissolution.

"The search-parties are looking for correct geometry," Jeosmi said. "They'll find it."

"And you?"

"I'll be between the light and whatever is looking at it."

Goapus completed the becoming. There was a bilby, salt-dusted, hollow-paced, on the ridge.

The search-parties found him on the second pass. They lifted him without ceremony — not roughly, procedurally — and moved toward the fissure. Jeosmi followed in the space between their footsteps, present in the way a shadow is present: completely, from a specific angle.

---

## X. The Cave

The cold below was organised. Not the ambient cold of the plain above — distributed, deliberate, the cold of a space that had been maintained at a specific temperature for a very long time and had no intention of varying. Every surface the same. Every breath the same composition. Nothing left to chance.

The shelves ran in every direction, floor to ceiling, and on every shelf: jars. The same jar, repeated into the dark. Each one sealed, each one filled with the same blue — the colour of something that had been alive and was now being held very carefully at the edge of motion. The collective light of them lit the cave in the cold of a room that stores things it doesn't want to change.

Glass coffins along the far wall, each fitted with a narrow tube, each tube running to a jar above it. The jars filling. Slowly. Blue, rising.

Chewbat was in the third coffin.

Day three.

The Bunyip was at the coffin with her hands moving through the patterns of her craft, her voice working, low and continuous. She was working her way through him, speaking what she found, reaching for it with the salt — and finding that what she spoke had already moved. Come back to itself before the salt could arrive. She withdrew, searched, found another place in him, lost it the same way.

Three days of this. Her voice had not rested.

Tekanter, against the far wall in his crystal chains, had watched the salt fail to adhere for what he estimated was four hundred attempts. He looked at Goapus being carried to a vacant coffin. He looked at the empty space between the shelves where Jeosmi was.

At the cave's centre, on the bare floor, alone: a single jar unlike the others. Dark. No blue in it. Dirty brown water, silted, the colour of a river that has not run in a very long time. Not sealed the way the others were sealed. No light in it. The only dark point in the cave.

He looked at it for a while. He filed it under: *significant, reason unknown, revisit.*

---

## XI. The Chains

Jeosmi moved to Tekanter. The crystal chains were built from the record of how he had fought — every blow compressed into salt, every direction he had thrown his weight, every angle of force held in the crystal's grain. A complete account of his violence. Thorough, in the specific way the cave was thorough.

Jeosmi untied them from behind, which nothing had accounted for, because a record of how a thing has fought only covers the directions it has already fought in.

"Your face," Tekanter said, very quietly.

"What about it," Jeosmi said.

"You always look like that when you're trying not to seem relieved."

"I am going to free your ankles and then we are going to wait for Goapus."

In his coffin, Goapus changed. Not into one thing — into a sequence of things, rapidly, without the usual patience, because patience was not available here. Bilby. Platypus. Stone. Thornbush. Bilby again. The system that moved through the cave tried to categorise each new form and found the category superseded before it could hold. The note the Choir produced became something that required a chest that did not exist to hold it — not screaming, past screaming, in the territory where a system has run every protocol it has and found each one insufficient.

The Bunyip turned from the coffin.

Jeosmi released fire.

The third coffin opened. Chewbat stood up, three days of careful work leaving no evidence on him — no salt, no purchase, nothing drawn to the surface and nothing held, the clean glass showing only his own unbothered reflection.

The Bunyip looked at the open coffin. At the clear crystal surface. At the complete, undisturbed fact of him, standing in it.

Tekanter tore the chains apart with one straight leap through the geometry of them — upward, which had not been in the record.

"You took your time," Chewbat said.

"I was in chains," Tekanter said.

"Goapus is still a thornbush," Jeosmi said, crossing to the second coffin, working the lock at the frequency that dissolved compressed crystal. "Goapus. You can stop now."

Goapus became Goapus. He sat up in the coffin and surveyed the cave with the expression of someone who has just been every taxonomy in sequence. "That," he said, "was a great deal of information."

"We're leaving," Jeosmi said.

---

## XII. The Chase

They ran up through the fissure and came out onto the plain in the cold white afternoon and the Bunyip came behind them.

She came out as what she had been in the cave — precise, enormous, controlled — and then she shed that shape and showed what was underneath. What was underneath was ancient and hideous in the specific way of something that has organized itself against grief for three centuries and has just watched the organization come apart. She breathed magic. She breathed bonds. The bilbies who had been standing at the fissure's edge holding the shape of themselves she had given them — they released it all at once and were just bilbies again and they ran.

The travellers spread and fought her in the open salt.

"She's working through us," Jeosmi said, already shifting frequency to stay ahead of whatever she found.

"I noticed," Tekanter said. He had felt it twice — something surfacing from him, the crystal forming fast at his wrists — and had torn it off each time. The third time would be harder.

Goapus changed shape in rapid succession and she lost him on the third change. Chewbat moved and she found nothing in him to draw out and her attention moved on with the particular expression of a system encountering an input it cannot process.

They were very close to having her.

She dissolved — not from the fight, not from being outmatched, but with the deliberateness of someone who has saved this option and has decided to use it — into thick black energy and went back down the hole.

The four of them stood on the salt in the sudden quiet.

"Well," Goapus said.

"She dissolved," Chewbat said.

"She did," Goapus agreed.

A pause. The wind.

"Into what?" Chewbat said.

Tekanter was very still, looking at the fissure, in the way he went still when something had arrived from a part of his past he did not take out often.

---

## XIII. The Binding

"I've seen that energy before," he said.

"In what context," Jeosmi said.

"When I was young. Three years in the service of the nine divine wattle celestials. I carried water. I carried messages. Mostly I watched." He looked at his hands. "The black energy is a binding. The cord that holds a guardian animal to its celestial owner. Each cord has a signature — specific, like a key's cuts."

"And you recognized this one," Chewbat said.

"The Bunny Celestial among the nine. Her guardian animal has a notch in its ear — not born, made, from an old healed injury." He turned. "The bunyip has the same notch."

"She ran," Jeosmi said.

"She ran." He said it the way you state the location of a thing, without temperature. "The binding doesn't break when a guardian animal runs. It trails. She has been carrying it for however long she has been down there."

"Which is centuries," Goapus said, from the ground, his bill to the salt. "The water-memory in the deep rock puts her here for at least three hundred years. Possibly more."

No one said anything for a moment.

"Can you reach the Celestial?" Chewbat asked.

"I know the frequency. I'll try."

---

## XIV. The Lullaby

They waited at the plain's centre, beside the fissure, in the late cold. The Choir was still audible from the garden's edges — attenuated now, losing its formation, the precise geometry of the sound beginning to come apart as the system that had held it frayed.

The Bunny Celestial arrived without announcement. She was small, and the warmth around her was the warmth of something that was itself without effort, without performance.

She looked at the fissure. Then at the plain's extent — the dissolving formations at the edges, the bodies finding themselves again in the loosening salt.

"How long," she said.

"Three hundred years at least," Goapus said. "Possibly four."

She was quiet for a moment. Then she sat at the fissure's edge and sang.

Not a summoning. Not a binding-song, not any register of celestial music that deals with authority or command. A lullaby — the kind that is sung to something small that has been enormous and terrible for a long time and has forgotten that being small is an option.

The song went down into the cold.

They waited.

The growling came up first. Then the Bunyip — enormous, hideous, furious — came out, and she saw the Celestial, and the transformation began in her without her consent. Her body fought it with everything it had accumulated across three centuries of working. And as the transformation moved through her, the sounds came — not her voice, from somewhere below her voice, from the places the work had sealed over: the pain of it, the cost of it, the meticulous not-looking, all coming out at once in sound, voices of a long time, and then they stopped.

What remained on the salt was a small dark rabbit.

Sitting in the plain, looking up.

The Celestial said, very quietly: "Oh. There you are."

She sang the lullaby again, the same song, the whole of it.

Just for her.

---

## XV. After

The Celestial stayed with the rabbit for a while and then came to the travellers.

One of the nine's guardians had run, three centuries ago — had run with another mount, and the other mount had gone north, and what was left behind had done what it was able to do with the materials available. The Celestial thanked them. She was not performing the gratitude. She was also looking at the rabbit while she expressed it, which Tekanter found reasonable under the circumstances.

Then she turned to Chewbat and gave him the coordinates for the next world.

Chewbat took them and said nothing. He thought about three days in the coffin and the salt finding no purchase. About the Bunyip at the glass, working with full precision and full patience, speaking each thing she found in him into the air and finding it already in motion before the salt could arrive. He thought about what a seam was — the gap between what a creature is and what it reaches toward, the space where what you have and what you want do not meet — and about the salt's need for that gap.

He thought about the jar on the cave floor. The one dark jar in all that blue. The dirty brown water in it, sitting still in the cave's organised cold, the only thing she had kept rather than processed across three centuries of the most thorough filing he had ever encountered.

He thought he understood why she had not been able to file it.

Around them the plain was changing — the garden's geometry releasing, the old formations settling as the tension that had held them came undone. The Choir's sound was breaking into individual voices, each one briefly individual, briefly confused, and then one by one: quiet.

Tekanter came beside him. "The next world," he said.

Tekanter looked out at the dissolving plain. At the small dark rabbit in the Celestial's warmth at the edge. At the jar of dirty river water that was, somewhere below them in the unlocking dark, still sitting on the cave floor.

"Golden," he said. "Wonderful."

They walked toward the Node.

---

## XVI. The First Thread

The doctrine settled in Chewbat's body as they walked — not as words but as weight, a particular density that meant something had been understood below the level of language.

*The world built to avoid the question gives the question a larger room. The Choir was the room. The garden was the room. The cave was the room. And in the room's centre, a jar of dirty water carried for three centuries without processing — because processing it would have required speaking aloud the thing the work had been arranged to face away from. One word, said aloud, to another creature, in the room that held all the work: and the room could not hold.*
