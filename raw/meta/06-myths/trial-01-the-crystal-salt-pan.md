## I. The Village of Rimwater

The first Heart-World smelled like rain that had forgotten to stop.

They came down from the Node onto a path of cracked mud that led toward a cluster of low buildings on the edge of a great flat white plain. The buildings were built from salt-brick — pale, faintly luminous, the walls leaving a mineral residue on your paw if you touched them. Some had been abandoned. The shutters were open and the interiors held the particular emptiness of rooms that were left mid-use, cups still on tables, tunnels half-dug.

"Half the village is gone," TheKanter said.

"Half is still here," Goatpus said.

A bilby was sitting outside the nearest building doing nothing. Not resting — doing nothing, which is different. She was staring at the salt flat with the fixed attention of someone waiting for something they know is not coming.

Goobat sat beside her. "What happened to this place?" he asked.

She took a long time to answer. "The Bunyip," she said. "She lives out in the flats, in the salt caves at the centre. She's always been there. My grandmother remembers her. Her grandmother too." She paused. "At first she only wept. The salt came from her tears — that's what the flat is. Centuries of her crying. Nobody knew what she'd lost. Nobody asked."

"And now?"

"Now she takes people." The bilby's voice had the flatness of someone who has explained this many times and stopped expecting it to change anything. "She sends her singers out at night — the ones she already has. They stand at the edge of the village and they sing. And if you're carrying a grief that fits their sound, you follow. You don't mean to. You just walk toward it. And in the morning you're gone."

"Who has she taken?"

The bilby was quiet for a moment. "My daughter," she said. "Three seasons ago. She'd just lost a joey. The singers came at dusk and I heard them and I held the door shut and I told her not to go and she said she wasn't going and then in the morning she was gone."

Goobat said nothing for a moment. Then: "What does the Bunyip want with them?"

"She makes them part of the Choir. Gives their grief somewhere to go. Gives them something to belong to." The bilby finally looked at him. "The worst part is my daughter probably isn't unhappy. That's the worst part."

## II. What the Scouts Reported

The Bunyip's scouts had been watching the village since before dawn.

They came back to the salt caves with the news in the late afternoon: a Wombat had arrived at Rimwater. Small, dense, old-looking for his age. Travelling with a Kangaroo, a Koala, and a Platypus. The scouts described the Wombat's movement — the way he walked, the quality of attention he gave to the ground beneath him.

The eldest of the Salt-Pilgrims, a possum whose salt-crust had reached his eyes and was working inward, carried the report down into the deep cave where the Bunyip rested in her brine-pool.

"A Singer," he said. "The real kind. Not the kind that learns songs. The kind that makes them."

The Bunyip had not moved in three days. She moved now — slowly, the brine running off her in sheets as she rose. Her eyes were open. They were always open.

"A Singer of Worlds?" she said.

"The village elder recognised the walk," the possum said. "He carries the Image and the Song together. He can open Nodes."

The Bunyip was very still for a long moment. Around her the cave dripped — the constant, metronomic sound of salt water finding its level.

"If I had a Singer," she said, "the grief would not be limited to this world." She spoke slowly, the way creatures speak when they are thinking something for the first time and finding it true. "It could go everywhere. Every Heart-World. I could make them all understand. They would all finally understand what was lost."

"The Kangaroo will be a problem," the possum said.

"Send him away," the Bunyip said. "Find him something to leap toward. His kind cannot resist a thing that needs leaping toward. And when he is gone, send the Choir."

## III. The Ruse

It was JoSmith who noticed it first — which was appropriate, since JoSmith noticed most things first and mentioned them last.

A creature was lying injured at the eastern edge of the village. A wallaby, young, one leg wrong. She was crying with the specific volume of someone who wanted to be heard from a distance. JoSmith watched her from across the square with his nostrils working.

"The leg isn't broken," he said quietly to Goobat. "She's holding it wrong."

"How do you know?"

"Because a creature with a broken leg protects it. She's presenting it." He watched the wallaby cry. "Someone sent her."

But TheKanter had already crossed the square. He crouched beside the wallaby with the straightforward concern of someone who sees an injured creature and moves toward it without calculating the implications. He was talking to her in the low, steady voice he used for frightened things.

JoSmith looked at Goobat. Goobat looked at Goatpus.

"Should we stop him?" Goobat asked.

"He won't listen," Goatpus said. "He never listens when there's someone hurt. That's not a flaw. It's the thing that makes him who he is. It's also what they're using."

The wallaby told TheKanter about a mob of her kind, stranded two hills east, their waterhole collapsed, three joeys in danger. She told it well — specific, urgent, the right details. TheKanter stood up. He looked back at Goobat with the expression of someone who knows he is probably being foolish and is going to do it anyway.

"I'll be back before dark," he said.

"You will not be back before dark," Goatpus said.

"I'll be back before dark," TheKanter said, and leapt east.

The wallaby watched him go. Then she stood up, her leg entirely functional, and walked into the salt flat without looking back.

## IV. The Choir at Dusk

They came at the hour when the light turned the salt flat gold and it looked, briefly, like something worth walking toward.

Goobat heard them from inside the bilby's house where they had taken shelter — a sound like the world agreeing with you. Like every doubt you'd ever had about yourself being answered correctly and gently, one by one. He sat very still and put his paws flat on the salt-brick floor and concentrated on its texture. Rough. Real. Cold.

"Don't listen to the content," JoSmith said from beside him. He had his eyes closed. He was metabolising the sound as it came, processing its chemistry before it could settle. "The content is made for you specifically. Whatever it's saying to you is true. That's not the problem. The problem is what it wants you to do with the true thing."

The sound was saying: *your mother walked into the Corvée and didn't come back and you were six years old and there was nothing you could do and there is nothing you can do and the weight of that is too heavy to keep carrying alone so put it down, put it down here, let someone else hold it for a while.*

Goobat's paws pressed harder into the floor.

"I know," he said. To himself. To the sound. To his mother, probably, wherever she was.

He stayed.

But Goatpus was already gone.

Goobat turned. The place where Goatpus had been was empty — the Platypus had slipped out through a gap in the back wall, down through the water-table, following his own logic as he always did. And with Goatpus gone there were only two of them, and the Choir's sound shifted, finding the new configuration, adjusting for what remained.

JoSmith's eyes opened. "It's changed," he said.

The sound was no longer about Goobat's mother. It was about the Groves families. About Orrubat and Agathaboo and every wombat who would still be in those tunnels when Goobat was done with his journey, still registering their burrows, still receiving their Advances. The sound said: *you left. You left them. You had a capacity and you used it to leave rather than to fight and the ones you left behind are still there.*

Goobat stood up.

"Don't," JoSmith said.

"I'm not going to them," Goobat said. "I'm just going to the door."

He went to the door. He opened it. He stood in the doorway looking at the salt flat in the gold dusk light and the Choir was arrayed across it, sixty creatures deep, their sound enormous and warm and specifically, precisely shaped to him.

He held the doorframe.

He held it for a long time.

Then something in the sound changed again — a new note, lower than the others, that seemed to come from directly beneath the house — and the floor cracked and two of the Brine-Husks came up through it, already reaching, and Goobat was gone.

---

## V. The Salt Caves

He woke in the dark with salt in his mouth.

He was seated — not restrained, not chained, but seated in a hollow in the cave floor that fit him precisely, as if it had been shaped for him, and the salt crystals that had formed around its edges overnight had done so against his body and now held him in the gentle, total way that mineral does when it has been given time.

He could move his head. He could breathe. He could not stand.

The cave was vast and dark and wet. Brine dripped from stalactites into a pool that occupied the cave's centre, and in the pool the Bunyip rested, and around the pool the Choir stood in their rings, and at the cave's edges the Brine-Husks stood still in their pillars of salt, and the Salt-Pilgrims moved through the space in their slow orbits, and everything was ordered and quiet and had been this way for a very long time.

The Bunyip turned her great head toward him.

"You came," she said. "As they all come."

"I was carried," Goobat said.

"Yes," she said. "That's how it works. The grief opens the door and then I carry you through. You were resistant. Most are not so resistant." She looked at him with those open, clear, drowning eyes. "You are a Singer."

"I've been called that."

"You will sing for me," she said. Not cruelly — as a statement of how things were going to be, the way someone states a geological fact. "There is a grief in this world that cannot be contained here. It is too large. It needs to go everywhere. Into every Heart-World. Every creature in every world needs to know what was lost. You will open the Nodes and I will send the Choir through them and the grief will go everywhere it needs to go."

"What was lost?" Goobat asked.

The question stopped her. He could see it stop her — the slight catch, the half-movement of a creature who was about to answer and then found the answer had gone strange in her mouth.

"Everything," she said. Which was not an answer.

"What specifically?" Goobat said. "Before everything. Before the salt. Before the first tear. What was the first thing?"

The Choir's sound changed key. The Brine-Husks moved slightly in their pillars. The Salt-Pilgrims slowed in their orbits.

"There was a river," the Bunyip said. Her voice was different now — smaller, not aggregate but singular, the voice she had before she absorbed the Choir's voices into her own. "The river ran through this world from the high caves to the sea. Everything drank from it. Everything lived along it. I was its guardian. I had been its guardian for as long as I could remember."

She stopped.

"And?" Goobat said.

"And it stopped," she said. "One season it was less. The next less than that. Within ten years it was gone. The bed was dry. The creatures along it died or left. I stayed." She looked at the brine pool around her. "I made the only water I could make."

"Was it your fault?"

The silence was long enough that Goobat could hear his own heartbeat in the crystal around his waist.

"I don't know," she said.

"Have you ever asked?"

---

## VI. TheKanter Returns

He had known within an hour that there was no mob, no joeys, no collapsed waterhole — just an empty hill and the echo of his own footfalls and the particular silence of a place that has never had a wallaby in it.

He came back at a run, which for TheKanter meant that the ground reported his approach before he appeared, each landing sending vibration through the salt crust in a signature Goobat would have recognised from a hundred paces.

JoSmith was outside the bilby's house. "They came up through the floor," he said.

TheKanter looked at the hole in the floor. He looked at the salt flat. He looked at the distant salt caves where, in the last of the gold light, he could see a dim glow from the Choir's assembled mass.

"How long ago?" he said.

"Three hours."

"Is he alive?"

"Yes," JoSmith said. "I can still smell his frequency. She hasn't done anything to him yet. She'll be talking."

"She'll be talking," TheKanter agreed. He was already studying the perimeter of the cave entrance, visible at the far edge of the flat. "How many at the entrance?"

"Forty Choir. A dozen Brine-Husks on each side. The Salt-Pilgrims inside."

"The Choir will hear me coming from two hundred paces."

"Yes," JoSmith said.

TheKanter thought for a moment. Then he looked down at his own body — the bulk of him, the unavoidable mass of a Kangaroo at full weight. He looked at the salt crystals forming on the flat's surface, each one the size of a paw-pad. He looked at the space between them.

"I need to be smaller," he said.

JoSmith tilted his head. "How much smaller?"

"The size of a salt-cricket," TheKanter said. "Can you do that?"

JoSmith was quiet for a moment. "The Drop works by changing the thermal and chemical state of what I metabolise," he said. "If I metabolise the *Tejo-vṛddhau* — your fire, your kinetic energy — compress it rather than disperse it—" He paused. "It would hurt."

"How much?"

"A considerable amount."

"How long would I stay small?"

"Until I reverse it. Or until the fire finds a way out on its own, which it will — you'd expand again from the inside. Rather violently."

"That's useful," TheKanter said. "Do it."

---

## VII. The Cricket and the Cave

The salt-cricket moved across the flat in the dark.

It was the size of a salt-cricket — thin legs, jointed, leaving marks in the crystal surface no heavier than the marks the real salt-crickets left. It moved at salt-cricket speed, which was patient and irregular, stopping and starting, taking the path of least resistance through the crystal landscape. The Choir at the cave entrance did not look at it. The Brine-Husks on either side did not register it. It was a salt-cricket.

It entered the cave in the fold of a Brine-Husk's shadow.

Inside, it navigated by the heat signature of the brine pool, moving along the cave wall, climbing when necessary, moving with the contained precision of something that knows it is temporarily the wrong size and is not going to waste the advantage. It passed the Salt-Pilgrims in their orbits. It passed the outer ring of the Choir. It reached the inner ring and stopped.

From here it could see Goobat in the hollow, and the Bunyip in the pool, and the conversation between them, which had evidently been going on for some time and had reached the point where the Bunyip was speaking about a river in a voice it had not used in centuries.

TheKanter assessed the situation.

The Bunyip was enormous. Her body occupied a significant portion of the cave. Her legs alone were longer than TheKanter at full height. The Choir stood between any approach route and the hollow where Goobat sat.

He moved toward the pool. No one saw a salt-cricket moving toward a brine pool because salt-crickets do this; it is what they are for.

He entered the water.

---

## VIII. From the Inside

What happened next the Salt-Pilgrims described afterward in fragmented terms, because none of them had a complete view and some of them had no view at all.

The brine pool erupted. Not from above — from within. The water went upward in a column and in the middle of the column something was expanding, and what was expanding was on fire, and the fire was orange-gold, the specific colour of contained kinetic energy releasing all at once, and the Bunyip came out of the pool the way something comes out of a pool when the pool has become untenable, which is quickly and without dignity.

TheKanter landed on the cave floor at full size, wet, steaming slightly, his fur standing in every direction, an expression on his face that JoSmith would later describe as "the look of a creature who has been the size of a salt-cricket and found it instructive."

The Choir broke. Not fled — broke, their arrangement shattering, sixty creatures going in sixty directions at once, the aggregate sound fragmenting into its component parts, each voice suddenly audible alone, each voice suddenly small.

The Brine-Husks cracked.

The salt around Goobat's waist, deprived of the resonant frequency that had been maintaining it, lost its cohesion. He stood up. He was stiff. He was full of salt. He looked at TheKanter.

"You're wet," Goobat said.

"The pool was necessary," TheKanter said. He was looking at the Bunyip, who had retreated to the far wall of the cave and was watching them both with the particular expression of a creature that has been removed from its brine pool against its will and is recalibrating.

---

## IX. The Question That Remained

Goobat walked to the cave wall.

The Bunyip could have reached him. She was large enough, fast enough, and the Choir was still present even if its arrangement had broken. But she was looking at him with the expression she'd had when he asked about the river — the expression of a creature who had been asked something it did not have a prepared answer for.

"You never found out whether it was your fault," Goobat said. "You stayed and wept and the weeping became the world and you kept the grief alive because if the grief died you'd have to find out the answer and the answer might be yes."

The Bunyip said nothing.

"Was there anyone else who knew the river?" Goobat asked.

"They left," she said. "Or died."

"So you've been the only record of it. The only one who remembers."

"Yes."

"And if you stop weeping—"

"Then it's over," she said. "Then it's just gone. There's nothing left of it." Her voice held something that was not grief — something older than grief, the thing grief is protecting. "At least this way it still exists. Inside the weeping."

Goobat sat on the cave floor. He was tired. His back hurt where the crystal had held him for hours. "The river still ran when it ran," he said. "The creatures who drank from it — that happened. You guarded it well for a very long time. That happened too. It doesn't stop having happened because you stop weeping."

The cave dripped. The metronome of the brine, small and constant.

"What if I don't know how to stop?" the Bunyip asked.

It was the most honest thing she had said. Goobat heard it as such.

"You don't have to stop," he said. "You just have to ask the question you've been avoiding. Whether it was your fault. Ask it. Get an answer. Even if the answer is yes — especially if it's yes — you can carry that. What you can't carry forever is the not knowing."

The Bunyip looked at the pool she had come from. At the salt flat she had made. At the Brine-Husks cracked open around the walls, some of them moving slowly, blinking, looking at their own paws.

"I don't know how to ask it," she said. "There's no one left to answer."

"There's the world itself," Goobat said. "Dig down far enough and the substrate holds the record of everything that happened in it. The answer is in the ground. I can show you where to look."

---

## X. The Morning

They left at first light.

The bilby was outside her house when they came back across the flat. She was watching the cave entrance the way she had been watching it since her daughter went in.

"She won't come back," Goobat said. "Not the way she was. But the Choir is broken. She's part of a different sound now." He paused. "She knows what she lost. That's different from not knowing."

The bilby looked at him for a long time. He did not look away.

"Will she be sad?" the bilby asked.

"Yes," Goobat said. "But it's her own sadness now. Not something she was given."

The bilby nodded. Not happily — it was not a happy nod. But it was the nod of someone who has been given something true, and knows the difference between that and being given something comfortable.

They took the road east.

---

## XI. The Doctrine

The first thread settled into Goobat's marrow as they walked.

*Truth requires inquiry, not assumption. The grief is real. The question you will not ask is the thing that makes it a prison. Ask it. Get the answer. The answer belongs to you — all of it, even the hard parts.*

He thought about his mother. He had not asked the question he needed to ask. He had carried the absence and made the absence a room he lived in and called the room grief rather than question.

He would ask the question. He did not know how yet. But he would ask it.

Behind him the salt flat was still white and enormous. But at its centre, in the deep caves, a wombat-digger and a Bunyip were together examining the substrate of a world, looking for the record of a river.

---

## XII. Opening the Second Doorway

He held the image of the Gilded Web — golden threads, ancient obligation, a beautiful cage that everyone inside had agreed to call architecture.

He felt it in his chest: the specific weight of a life organised around what others had decided it ought to be.

He sang it open.

They stepped through.
