## I. Arrival

The plain had once held water. The ground still said so — in the pale cracked skin of the flat where the last water had gathered and gone, in the dead channels tracing their remembered courses through the flat, in the particular quality of the cold, which was not weather but residue, the cold of a place that has been scoured of what it was and left with the shape of the absence.

They came down from the Node onto the salt and stopped.

"River," Goapus said. He was crouching, bill to the ground, the way he always attended to unfamiliar terrain. "Old one. Very old. Something in the deep substrate still holds the memory of it." He looked up. "The memory is distressed."

"Distressed," Tekanter said.

"Rivers have feelings about being dried out. This one has been having this particular feeling for several centuries."

Across the flat, barely audible at this distance, the singing.

Chewbat turned toward it without deciding to. His chest opened, briefly, toward the sound — the specific, involuntary opening that a harmony of that quality produces in a singer's body, the way light produces a reflex in the eye. Then the part of him that was not his chest closed the opening again, quietly. The note had not changed since they arrived. Had not wavered, not breathed, not shifted one interval. Technically it was perfect. That was precisely what was wrong with it.

"Don't follow it," Jeosmi said.

"I wasn't going to," Chewbat said.

"You were considering it."

"I was considering not considering it."

Tekanter had moved to the edge of one of the dry channels, his gold eyes tracking the horizon. "There's smoke east. Real smoke, not salt haze. Which means something is burning something, which means there's a village." He looked back at them. "Also I am deeply thirsty. Can we."

They went east.

## II. Mallee

The village sat at the plain's edge in geometrically perfect depressions, each dwelling low and precise, no ornamentation, everything arranged with the neatness of people who have decided that order is the only reliable response to circumstances they cannot control. The inhabitants moved carefully. They watched the troupe arrive with the specific expression of people who have learned that watching is safer than engaging.

An elderly bilby named Mallee met them at the first dwelling. She had warm broth ready — which she did not need to have ready, which meant she had been watching the plain for some time before they arrived.

She told them about the water first. An underground well, still good, but she needed help before she could share it. This she said without apology.

"We're listening," Chewbat said.

"There was a choir," she said. "Forty voices. They sang to the water spirit — she kept the river full, the rains reliable. When the full choir sang, she answered." She set down her cup. "Two months ago, a bilby named Mulga took most of the village away with him. Into the mountains. Without the choir's full number the spirit stopped answering."

"Took them how?" Jeosmi said.

"Convinced them. That the spirit was gone. That the choir was singing for nothing." She looked at the table.

"And were they?" Chewbat asked.

She didn't answer that directly. "Creatures go missing from the village," she said. "In the night. Some come back. The ones who come back are — " She stopped at the word, turned it over. "Quieter."

Tekanter had been standing in the doorway, working the room the way he worked a perimeter. He looked at the careful positions of every object in it. At the daughter sitting in the corner, still as furniture, her eyes tracking movement but nothing else.

"What do you need us to do with Mulga?" he said.

"Find him. Remove him as a consideration."

Tekanter and Goapus exchanged the look they exchanged when the word *consideration* was doing a great deal of work on someone's behalf.

"I'll go," Tekanter said.

Chewbat looked at his broth. He did not drink it. Jeosmi, seated beside him, also had not drunk his. Their eyes met briefly over the table.

---

## III. The Mountain

Tekanter crossed the range in six leaps and found the lair by the sounds coming out of it — the acoustic signature of a group of bodies that had been living in a space long enough to stop being careful about noise. He announced himself to the two guards at the entrance in the way he usually announced himself to guards, which left them sitting against the rock wall looking thoughtful, and called out for whoever was in charge.

The leader came out.

He was a bilby. The size of a boot. He came without weapons and without hesitation, and his face had the look of someone who has been waiting for something like this to arrive and is almost relieved that it has.

They fought.

Mulga was matched to Tekanter blow for blow in a way that had no justification in the relative sizes of their bodies. The first strike Tekanter threw was absorbed and returned before he had finished it — not deflected, not dodged, but received and sent back with its own weight added. He adjusted. The second exchange was the same. So was the third. A boot-sized bilby returning a kangaroo's full force squared, with the economy of movement that belongs to someone who has been doing this for a very long time in a very large variety of circumstances.

Tekanter began to take the fight seriously.

It lasted six exchanges. The bilby fought with precision rather than power — tracking where the weight was going before it arrived, finding the angles, never opposing force directly. Tekanter fought with controlled fire and mass, watching for the pattern in the bilby's movement, not finding one. They stopped at the same moment, four paces apart, taking each other's measure. Both slightly winded. Neither damaged.

Tekanter saw the tattoo.

On the bilby's neck, visible now in the stillness: the mark of Discernment. Interlocked circles, old ink, the lines worn smooth where the fur had moved over them for years. He would have known the design from fifty paces in poor light. He carries the same mark himself, pressed into the skin below his collarbone on the morning he took the oath — the cold of the instrument, the elder's hands, the specific words said over him while the mark was made, which he has not repeated to anyone.

The Order of the Discerning Eye is old enough that its origins are in a period before the Heart-Worlds took their current forms. It was not founded as a fighting order, though many of its members fight. It was founded as a witnessing order — those who could be trusted to carry truth across the hardest ground without distorting it, who could be sent into situations where the information returned needed to be exactly what was there and nothing added and nothing taken away. The oath was simple: *I will report what I find. I will not report what I did not find. I will not lose one for the other regardless of the cost.* The mark was the oath's physical confirmation — the body accepting the constraint, the salt and ink pressed into the skin to hold the agreement in the flesh.

The constraint had teeth. A member who spoke a falsehood felt it immediately: a specific depletion, as though the power that the oath had given drained back out through the place where the lie had passed. Speak falsely enough and you emptied yourself entirely. Members did not do this by accident. It happened once, to a new initiate, who recovered and was not asked to leave, but who thereafter chose their words with the particular care of someone who has felt the cost.

The order had no politics. It had members in the service of the nine wattle celestials and members who had never met a celestial. It had members in the Cathedral's records and members the Cathedral had been trying to locate for a decade. It had, apparently, bilbies living in the mountains of the Crystal Salt Pan running rescue operations on a half-dried plain.

Tekanter had met eleven members in his life before this. He had not expected the twelfth to be here.

He lowered his hands.

"Talk," he said.

---

## IV. The True Account

There was no rebellion.

Eighty percent of the village had not followed anyone anywhere of its own choosing. It had been taken — in the night, by shadows — found afterward arranged in formation on the salt plain, faces to the sky, mouths open, singing. Mulga's group had been pulling survivors out for two months. The rescued came back with less than they had left with. He couldn't say what the less was. It moved differently in their eyes.

"The water spirit," Tekanter said. "Captured?"

"Something has her power or has replaced it. The plain is controlled." He used the word carefully. "Systematically."

"You've been watching it."

"Two months. The thing below the plain runs a process. It takes a creature, puts it in a glass box, and over seven days it removes whatever in them is still reaching toward something. By the end the body works but the reaching is gone. It goes into a jar." He looked at the rock. "I've recovered eleven survivors. None of them are right. Three of my own people went in after the first rescues and didn't come back."

"And you've stayed."

"I took an oath."

Tekanter did not say anything to that. He understood it exactly.

"The old bilby," he said. "Mallee. The village at the plain's edge. The story about you leading the rebellion."

Mulga looked at him. "There is no village at the plain's edge," he said. "There hasn't been for two months."

Tekanter was running before Mulga finished the sentence.

---

## V. The Dry Riverbed

There was no village.

Goapus and Jeosmi lay on the cracked mud of the old riverbed, breathing, coming back from whatever had been in the broth. The depression where the dwelling had stood held only the shape of its foundations in the crust — precise, geometric, already smoothing at the edges as the wind worked on it.

Chewbat was not there.

Tekanter waited while they came back to themselves. He said what needed to be said once Jeosmi's eyes had focused and Goapus had managed to sit up, and there was nearly a fight at the end of it, and then he walked away from the fight because the alternative was hitting Goapus and he was not going to do that.

He stood fifty paces off at the edge of the old channel and made himself breathe.

Jeosmi came up beside him. "I know," he said.

"You were drugged."

"I know."

"Both of you."

"I know, Tekanter."

The wind moved across the flat. The singing came with it — faint, sourceless, perfect from a distance.

"Mulga's camp," Jeosmi said. "Two ridges east. If anyone knows how the entrances to these lairs are marked—"

"I'll go," Tekanter said.

"I was suggesting we go together."

"I'll go," Tekanter said again. He meant something different by it the second time.

Jeosmi went back to help Goapus stand.

---

## VI. The Garden

The outcast bilbies at Mulga's camp gave him one useful piece of information: the entrances were marked with a circle of singing bilbies around the fissure.

He walked the plain for three hours. The Choir's harmonic was everywhere, embedded in the salt itself, sourceless, not coming from any direction so much as emanating from the ground. He followed not the sound but the direction it came *from*, which is a different kind of listening and requires a different kind of patience, both of which he had.

He found the ring.

The bilbies in it were not singing in the way that a singer chooses to sing. They were singing the way a struck bell makes sound — continuously, without variation, because they had been made to resonate and had not been given a way to stop. He called out to them. He called again, louder. He stepped through the circle and put his hand on the shoulder of the nearest one.

Nothing in them heard him.

He looked at what he was standing in the middle of.

The formation ran from this point outward to every horizon — five arms burned into the salt, each a trench of darker crust, black-edged, the mark of something that had been working in this place long enough to alter the ground's own chemistry. Five sections. In each section, in concentric arcs, in radial lines, in spirals requiring a patience that bodies do not naturally contain—

He stood very still for a moment.

They were not formations.

They were what was left of bodies that had been standing in those positions long enough for the salt to take them. From the outside in, crystallising the surface first and moving inward through the years. The oldest were white and featureless as the plain around them, their outlines dissolved into the crust. The newer ones still held faces. The mouths were open. The sound passing through them had the same quality as the sound passing through the bilbies in the ring — continuous, precise, no one inside choosing it. Two hundred of them. More, further out, older, further along.

Each section oriented toward a cluster of small sealed glass jars at its centre.

At the formation's heart: a fissure in the salt. Cold rising from it, steady.

He went in.

---

## VII. The Descent

He fought all the way down — wall to wall in the narrow passage, the iron-tipped tail feeling out the dark ahead of his eyes, his body occupying the space so completely that there was no room left in it for anything that wanted him stopped. The things that came at him in the passage had the quality of a system defending itself rather than creatures choosing to fight, which he found, in some ways, more disturbing than creatures who chose. Malice has a temperature. These had none.

He reached the cave floor.

He stood in it and took in what he could see: jars, shelves, cold, blue light from the jars running to the far dark and beyond. Glass coffins along the far wall, each fitted with a tube, each tube running to a jar above it.

Then the black energy came.

Not from a direction. From the concept of all directions simultaneously, and the crystal formed at his wrists before he had processed what was happening. He continued to fight. He fought until the crystal had closed around every point of leverage his body had to offer, and then he stood in it, breathing, cataloguing.

He had his eyes. He had his fire, held in. The chains would heat before he would, if it came to that. He filed this under: *available, not yet.*

He waited.

Goapus and Jeosmi had followed at the necessary distance. They had seen the black energy take him. They had assessed it correctly and had not come in. He would have made the same call. He noted this and did not feel better about it.

---

## VIII. The Testimony

They went back to Mulga's camp.

One of the survivors was there — a bilby, recovered enough to speak, sitting with the particular stillness of someone who is conserving something they are no longer sure they have enough of. Goapus sat beside her and said nothing for a long time, which was his method when something needed room. Eventually the room was enough.

"The glass coffin is smooth," she said. "The right size. The air is good."

Jeosmi had closed his eyes.

"She adds salt to the air each morning. Measured. Calibrated. While it settles she speaks — quietly, and very precisely — each thing in you that is still turned toward something absent. Each reach. Each waiting place."

"What does she say?" Goapus asked.

"What's there," the bilby said. "She finds it and she says it and when she says it, it rises. To where the salt is. And the salt holds it." She looked at her paws. "The third day your memories begin coming forward on their own. Without being asked. In order."

Silence.

"By the fifth day I understood that I had been making it harder than it needed to be."

Jeosmi opened his eyes.

"The seventh day there was nothing left that wanted anything," she said. "My body was there. It stood when it was asked to stand. It sang when it was asked to sing." She looked up at Goapus with an expression that was not quite an expression, the way a drawing of a face is not quite a face. "I don't know what left. I don't have words for what left. She was — "

"Thorough," Goapus said.

"She was very thorough," the bilby agreed.

Goapus and Jeosmi went out onto the ridge and stood in the open cold with the plain below them and the fissure somewhere at its centre and Tekanter in it, in chains, with his fire held in.

"Well," Jeosmi said.

"Yes," Goapus said.

"I have an idea."

"I was waiting for that."

---

## IX. The Ruse

"You're going to become a bilby," Jeosmi said.

"I know," Goapus said. He was already attending to it — not performing the change but attending to it the way you attend to something that requires accuracy rather than effort. A true becoming, not mimicry, which meant entering fully into the bilby's specific quality of being in the world: the hollow rhythm, the salt-dust in the fur, the metabolic signature of a creature that had been in the plain's proximity long enough to begin its dissolution.

"The search-parties are looking for correct geometry," Jeosmi said. "They'll find it."

"And you?"

"I'll be between the light and whatever is looking at it."

Goapus completed the becoming. There was a bilby, salt-dusted, hollow-paced, on the ridge.

The search-parties found him on the second pass. They lifted him without ceremony — not roughly, procedurally — and moved toward the fissure. Jeosmi followed in the space between their footsteps, present in the way a shadow is present: completely, from a specific angle.

---

## X. The Cave

The cold below was organised. Not the ambient cold of the plain above — distributed, deliberate, the cold of a space that had been maintained at a specific temperature for a very long time and had no intention of varying. Every surface the same. Every breath the same composition. Nothing left to chance.

The shelves ran in every direction, floor to ceiling, and on every shelf: jars. The same jar, repeated into the dark. Each one sealed, each one filled with the same blue — the colour of something that had been alive and was now being held very carefully at the edge of motion. The collective light of them lit the cave in the cold of a room that stores things it doesn't want to change.

Glass coffins along the far wall, each fitted with a narrow tube, each tube running to a jar above it. The jars filling. Slowly. Blue, rising.

Chewbat was in the third coffin.

Day three.

The Bunyip was at the coffin with her hands moving through the patterns of her craft, her voice working, low and continuous. She was working her way through him, speaking what she found, reaching for it with the salt — and finding that what she spoke had already moved. Come back to itself before the salt could arrive. She withdrew, searched, found another place in him, lost it the same way.

Three days of this. Her voice had not rested.

Tekanter, against the far wall in his crystal chains, had watched the salt fail to adhere for what he estimated was four hundred attempts. He looked at Goapus being carried to a vacant coffin. He looked at the empty space between the shelves where Jeosmi was.

At the cave's centre, on the bare floor, alone: a single jar unlike the others. Dark. No blue in it. Dirty brown water, silted, the colour of a river that has not run in a very long time. Not sealed the way the others were sealed. No light in it. The only dark point in the cave.

He looked at it for a while. He filed it under: *significant, reason unknown, revisit.*

---

## XI. The Chains

Jeosmi moved to Tekanter. The crystal chains were built from the record of how he had fought — every blow compressed into salt, every direction he had thrown his weight, every angle of force held in the crystal's grain. A complete account of his violence. Thorough, in the specific way the cave was thorough.

Jeosmi untied them from behind, which nothing had accounted for, because a record of how a thing has fought only covers the directions it has already fought in.

"Your face," Tekanter said, very quietly.

"What about it," Jeosmi said.

"You always look like that when you're trying not to seem relieved."

"I am going to free your ankles and then we are going to wait for Goapus."

In his coffin, Goapus changed. Not into one thing — into a sequence of things, rapidly, without the usual patience, because patience was not available here. Bilby. Platypus. Stone. Thornbush. Bilby again. The system that moved through the cave tried to categorise each new form and found the category superseded before it could hold. The note the Choir produced became something that required a chest that did not exist to hold it — not screaming, past screaming, in the territory where a system has run every protocol it has and found each one insufficient.

The Bunyip turned from the coffin.

Jeosmi released fire.

The third coffin opened. Chewbat stood up, three days of careful work leaving no evidence on him — no salt, no purchase, nothing drawn to the surface and nothing held, the clean glass showing only his own unbothered reflection.

The Bunyip looked at the open coffin. At the clear crystal surface. At the complete, undisturbed fact of him, standing in it.

Tekanter tore the chains apart with one straight leap through the geometry of them — upward, which had not been in the record.

"You took your time," Chewbat said.

"I was in chains," Tekanter said.

"You're always in chains."

"That is empirically not true."

"Goapus is still a thornbush," Jeosmi said, crossing to the second coffin, working the lock at the frequency that dissolved compressed crystal. "Goapus. You can stop now."

Goapus became Goapus. He sat up in the coffin and surveyed the cave with the expression of someone who has just been every taxonomy in sequence. "That," he said, "was a great deal of information."

"We're leaving," Jeosmi said.

---

## XII. The Chase

They ran up through the fissure and came out onto the plain in the cold white afternoon and the Bunyip came behind them.

She came out as what she had been in the cave — precise, enormous, controlled — and then she shed that shape and showed what was underneath. What was underneath was ancient and hideous in the specific way of something that has organized itself against grief for three centuries and has just watched the organization come apart. She breathed magic. She breathed bonds. The bilbies who had been standing at the fissure's edge holding the shape of themselves she had given them — they released it all at once and were just bilbies again and they ran.

The troupe spread and fought her in the open salt.

"She's working through us," Jeosmi said, already shifting frequency to stay ahead of whatever she found.

"I noticed," Tekanter said. He had felt it twice — something surfacing from him, the crystal forming fast at his wrists — and had torn it off each time. The third time would be harder.

Goapus changed shape in rapid succession and she lost him on the third change. Chewbat moved and she found nothing in him to draw out and her attention moved on with the particular expression of a system encountering an input it cannot process.

They were very close to having her.

She dissolved — not from the fight, not from being outmatched, but with the deliberateness of someone who has saved this option and has decided to use it — into thick black energy and went back down the hole.

The four of them stood on the salt in the sudden quiet.

"Well," Goapus said.

"She dissolved," Chewbat said.

"She did," Goapus agreed.

A pause. The wind.

"Into what?" Chewbat said.

Tekanter was very still, looking at the fissure, in the way he went still when something had arrived from a part of his past he did not take out often.

---

## XIII. The Binding

"I've seen that energy before," he said.

"In what context," Jeosmi said.

"When I was young. Three years in the service of the nine divine wattle celestials. I carried water. I carried messages. Mostly I watched." He looked at his hands. "The black energy is a binding. The cord that holds a guardian animal to its celestial owner. Each cord has a signature — specific, like a key's cuts."

"And you recognized this one," Chewbat said.

"The Bunny Celestial among the nine. Her guardian animal has a notch in its ear — not born, made, from an old healed injury." He turned. "The bunyip has the same notch."

"She ran," Jeosmi said.

"She ran." He said it the way you state the location of a thing, without temperature. "The binding doesn't break when a guardian animal runs. It trails. She has been carrying it for however long she has been down there."

"Which is centuries," Goapus said, from the ground, his bill to the salt. "The water-memory in the deep rock puts her here for at least three hundred years. Possibly more."

No one said anything for a moment.

"Can you reach the Celestial?" Chewbat asked.

"I know the frequency. I'll try."

---

## XIV. The Lullaby

They waited at the plain's centre, beside the fissure, in the late cold. The Choir was still audible from the garden's edges — attenuated now, losing its formation, the precise geometry of the sound beginning to come apart as the system that had held it frayed.

The Bunny Celestial arrived without announcement. She was small, and the warmth around her was the warmth of something that was itself without effort, without performance.

She looked at the fissure. Then at the plain's extent — the dissolving formations at the edges, the bodies finding themselves again in the loosening salt.

"How long," she said.

"Three hundred years at least," Goapus said. "Possibly four."

She was quiet for a moment. Then she sat at the fissure's edge and sang.

Not a summoning. Not a binding-song, not any register of celestial music that deals with authority or command. A lullaby — the kind that is sung to something small that has been enormous and terrible for a long time and has forgotten that being small is an option.

The song went down into the cold.

They waited.

The growling came up first. Then the Bunyip — enormous, hideous, furious — came out, and she saw the Celestial, and the transformation began in her without her consent. Her body fought it with everything it had accumulated across three centuries of working. And as the transformation moved through her, the sounds came — not her voice, from somewhere below her voice, from the places the work had sealed over: the pain of it, the cost of it, the meticulous not-looking, all coming out at once in sound, voices of a long time, and then they stopped.

What remained on the salt was a small dark rabbit.

Sitting in the plain, looking up.

The Celestial said, very quietly: "Oh. There you are."

She sang the lullaby again, the same song, the whole of it.

Just for her.

---

## XV. After

The Celestial stayed with the rabbit for a while and then came to the troupe.

One of the nine's guardians had run, three centuries ago — had run with another mount, and the other mount had gone north, and what was left behind had done what it was able to do with the materials available. The Celestial thanked them. She was not performing the gratitude. She was also looking at the rabbit while she expressed it, which Tekanter found reasonable under the circumstances.

Then she turned to Chewbat and gave him the coordinates for the next world.

Not Tekanter.

Chewbat took them and said nothing. He thought about three days in the coffin and the salt finding no purchase. About the Bunyip at the glass, working with full precision and full patience, reading each thing in him and speaking it into the air and finding it already in motion before the salt could arrive. He thought about what a seam was — the gap between what a creature is and what it reaches toward, the space where what you have and what you want do not meet — and about the salt's need for that gap.

He thought about the jar on the cave floor. The one dark jar in all that blue. The dirty brown water in it, sitting still in the cave's organised cold, the only thing she had kept rather than processed across three centuries of the most thorough filing he had ever encountered.

He thought he understood why she had not been able to file it.

Around them the plain was changing — the garden's geometry releasing, the old formations settling as the tension that had held them came undone. The Choir's sound was breaking into individual voices, each one briefly individual, briefly confused, and then one by one: quiet.

Tekanter came beside him. "The next world," he said.

"The Gilded Web."

Tekanter looked out at the dissolving plain. At the small dark rabbit in the Celestial's warmth at the edge. At the jar of dirty river water that was, somewhere below them in the unlocking dark, still sitting on the cave floor.

"Golden," he said. "Wonderful."

They walked toward the Node.

---

## XVI. The First Thread

The doctrine settled in Chewbat's body as they walked — not as words but as weight, a particular density that meant something had been understood below the level of language.

*The world built to avoid the question gives the question a larger room. The Choir was the room. The garden was the room. The cave was the room. And in the room's centre, a jar of dirty water carried for three centuries without processing — because processing it would have required speaking aloud the thing the work had been arranged to face away from. One word, said aloud, to another creature, in the room that held all the work: and the room could not hold.*

*The answer does not need to be good. The answer needs to be real, and said, in the presence of something that can hear it. A word said in silence ten thousand times is the same as the word never said.*

*The salt needs a seam. A creature that has nothing in it turned away from itself gives the salt nowhere to enter. Not wholeness — simply presence: no part reaching backward, no gap between the sound and the making of it.*

He held the Image the plain had given him — the river, its actual colour, the sound of it against this specific crossing-point's rock — and the Song of the Node's frequency, which was the water-memory in the deep substrate, which Goapus had found in the ground and spoken aloud without knowing what he gave.

He sang the Node open.

They stepped through.
