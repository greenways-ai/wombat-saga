# Wombat Society — Pre and Post Sovereign

*The social architecture of wombat life: what it was, how it was restructured, what survived.*

---

## Lo Snouts and High Noses

Post-Sovereign wombat society is divided into two classes. The division is not written into any law. It is structured into the infrastructure.

**Lo Snouts** are the labour class — the tunnelers, the farmers, the bowl-makers, the unlicensed assessors, the Groves families, the wombats who live by paw-work and whose relationship to the earth is direct and physical. The name is not neutral. It was applied by the High Noses and carries the implication of something low, close to the ground, unremarkable. Lo Snouts have reclaimed it in the way communities reclaim names given to diminish them: by using it among themselves without apology and letting the diminishment fall back on whoever intended it.

**High Noses** are the bureaucratic class — the Cathedral administrators, the Tally officials, the Grout inspectors and their supervisors, the High Auditors, the Cathedral Council. The term originates in Lo Snout usage: a High Nose is a wombat who no longer puts their snout to the earth. They walk with their nose up, reading documents rather than clay, measuring yield rather than listening to the wall. High Noses are wombats who have achieved administrative standing — by birth into an established Cathedral family, by strategic compliance, or by accepting the deal the Sovereigns offered the Wombrahminas two generations back.

**The line between them is policed by the Tally.** A Lo Snout with a clean Tally-record and the right connections can move toward High Nose status. A High Nose family that falls from administrative favor can find its members reclassified downward in a generation. This permeability is not generosity — it is the system's mechanism for maintaining itself. Enough movement to keep Lo Snouts believing that compliance is rewarded, not enough movement to actually redistribute power.

**Before the Sovereigns, there were only Lo Snouts.** Not as a class — as a description. All wombats were communal, earth-close, organized in wombutzim, snouts to the ground. The category didn't exist because its opposite didn't exist. The High Nose class was created by the Sovereign restructuring, as a byproduct of the Wombrahminas' co-option and the institutionalization of the Cathedral. It takes a hierarchy to produce a bottom. The bottom was always there. The top was built.

## The Wombutz

The basic unit of wombat life was the **wombutz** (pl. *wombutzim*) — a self-sustaining community of between thirty and one hundred and fifty wombats, dug into a shared tunnel network, feeding from shared production, raising children collectively, and making decisions by the whole.

The word has no clean translation into post-Sovereign administrative language. The closest the Council ever managed was *Unregistered Residential Cluster,* which captures the fact of it while missing everything about it.

A wombutz was not a family unit scaled up. It was not a village in the grid-town sense. It was something closer to a body: each part doing what it was made for, the whole being more capable than the parts. A wombat in a wombutz was not *contributing to* something larger — they were simply doing what came naturally, and the larger thing emerged from that.

---

### Scale and Structure

Most wombutzim ran on three layers:

**The tunnels** — communally dug and communally maintained. No section of tunnel belonged to any individual. The whole network was the community's, and the community kept it. A crack in any wall was everyone's problem and everyone's repair. A new entrance was everyone's project and everyone's decision. Tunnels were the body of the wombutz; their maintenance was the wombutz breathing.

**The burrows** — family spaces within the network. Each family or household had its own burrow, its own entrance, its own character. Burrows were private. They were also, in practice, perpetually semi-open — a neighbour's child asleep under your workbench was not unusual, a friend appearing at the entrance to talk through a problem was expected, Orrubat arriving with opinions was a feature of the landscape rather than an intrusion.

**The commons** — the shared spaces at the network's centre: the workshop, the kiln, the storage, the gathering chamber. The commons was where the wombutz did its collective business. Where bowls were fired, where bread was baked in quantity, where the community ate together on the significant days, where arguments about tunnel direction and food allocation were hashed out until everyone had said what needed saying.

---

### The Work

A wombutz divided its labor not by assignment but by aptitude and inclination, with the understanding that every kind of work was necessary and none was more important than another. The practical consequence: no one was above fixing a drainage problem, and no one was below being consulted on a decision that affected them.

**The tunnelers** maintained the structural network. In a healthy wombutz they worked in roving pairs — one digger, one listener — moving through the tunnels each morning the way a body runs its circulation, checking what needed checking, addressing what needed addressing. The listener pressed paws to walls. The digger did what the listener said.

**The Seam-Readers** (before their guild was institutionalized) practiced within the wombutz and ranged beyond it. Their formal role was reading the health of the earth around the tunnels — water movement, structural stability, the quality of the clay — but their informal role was as the community's early warning system for anything the earth was doing that required attention. A good Seam-Reader in a wombutz was the difference between catching a failing section in week one and dealing with a collapse in month six.

**The bowl-makers** worked in the commons kiln, producing the singing bowls that were the wombutz's acoustic infrastructure: working bowls for the Seam-Readers, ceremony bowls for the Wail, everyday bowls that the community used to send signal through the clay when voices couldn't carry. Not every wombutz had a bowl-maker of Morillaboo's calibre. But every wombutz had bowls, and someone who understood them, because a wombutz without bowls was a community that couldn't hear itself.

**The farmers** worked both underground and surface. Mushroom cultivation in the deep, maintained without light, by feel and by the particular smell of healthy mycelium versus sick. Surface-farm work where the wombutz had surface access: clay-pressed crops, drainage management, the specific agriculture of creatures who move between underground and sky and understand both. The Groves surface-farm market is a remnant of this practice — the goods different, the logic the same.

**The healers** held the pharmacological knowledge that, in the integrated world, was supplemented by koala expertise. After the Closing, wombat healers worked more independently, developing their own systems — poultices from certain clay compositions, the specific pressure of the paw applied to a bruise, the underground herbs that grew in Arnam-adjacent soil and had properties the surface world didn't know about. Healing in a wombutz was not a clinical transaction. It was a community function, continuous, embedded in daily life.

---

### Children

Children in a wombutz belonged to the community before they belonged to the family.

This was not an ideology. It was just how things worked when forty to a hundred wombats lived in a shared tunnel network and had been doing so for generations. A child born in a wombutz was known to everyone in it from the first week. They were carried by whoever was nearby, fed by whoever had food, put to sleep in whatever burrow was closest when tiredness arrived. By the time they were walking, they had effective parents in every burrow on the network.

The practical consequence was a quality of security that post-Sovereign wombats, individualized by the Tally and atomized into nuclear household units, often describe as implausible when they hear about it: the knowledge, embodied and not performed, that you were not going to be abandoned, not going to be without food, not going to face anything alone, because the community was structurally incapable of letting that happen. Not because individuals were exceptionally virtuous — they weren't, they argued, held grudges, had bad seasons, were sometimes terrible neighbors. But because the system itself was organized around the assumption that everyone stayed.

Children learned work by proximity. A tunneler's child spent years underfoot in the tunnels before picking up a claw-guard and contributing. A bowl-maker's child sat in the workshop until the shapes of good clay and bad clay were in their paws before they were in their understanding. There was no formal apprenticeship, no certificate of completion. There was just: you have been here long enough, you understand this well enough, we trust you with it.

The inter-wombutz competitions began as children's play and were never fully distinguished from it, which was the point.

---

## The the Round

Twice a year — at the turn of the wet season and at the turn of the dry — multiple wombutzim in a region came together for the **the Round**: a gathering that was simultaneously a fair, a congress, a competition, and a communal performance of the Wail.

The word itself predates written wombat language. Its root is disputed even in pre-Sovereign sources: some connect it to an old word for *joining*, others to a word for *the specific quality of sound when two bowls harmonize in the same chamber.* Wombrahminas, asked to explain the word, typically said: *you'll know it when you're in one.*

A the Round lasted three to five days, depending on how many wombutzim attended and how much had accumulated since the last one. It was hosted on a rotational basis — each wombutz taking the the Round in turn, which meant each wombutz spent the years between its turns preparing the hosting infrastructure: clearing the ground, expanding the communal tunnels, building the the Round chambers where the competitions would be held.

The the Round had no formal agenda. It had a sequence, which was different.

**Day one:** arrivals. Wombrahminas came first, always — they had been traveling between wombutzim since the previous the Round and arrived knowing who had what news, who had a dispute needing resolution, who had a surplus that matched another wombutz's shortage. Their first day was logistical, conducted in the margins, the infrastructure work before the thing itself.

**Day two:** the commons. Trading, exchange, the informal economy of a community that tracked nothing but remembered everything. Goods moved between wombutzim not by negotiation but by the older logic: you brought what you had too much of, you took what you needed, the Wombrahminas witnessed and held the pattern. No one went home with less than they came. This was not enforced. It was simply what happened when a community was small enough that everyone knew what everyone else was carrying.

**Days two through four:** the competitions.

---

### The Competitions

The inter-wombutz competitions were simultaneously serious and playful, which is the only register that works when the activity is both genuine skill and communal theatre.

**The Long Bore.** Teams of four tunnel at full effort for a set time — measured by a sand-fall, the same duration at every the Round. The team that digs the most tunnel wins. Straightness is not assessed. Speed is the only metric. The Long Bore produces the most chaos and the most noise of any competition, and the crowd traditionally gathers around the opening when the sand-fall ends and bets on which team has gone furthest. The bets are settled in clay-bread.

**The Precision Bore.** The opposite of the Long Bore. A single tunneler, working alone, is given a direction and a target distance. They must dig as straight a tunnel as possible by feel, without chalk lines, without a spirit level, without anything but the sense in their body of what *straight* means underground. The target is measured at the end. Deviations of less than a body-width over ten metres are considered excellent. Deviations of less than a paw-width are considered, in the Wombrahmina phrase, *the earth tunneling through the wombat rather than the wombat tunneling through the earth.*

**The Listening Bore.** A smooth river stone is buried at an unknown location within a marked area, three paw-depths down, by a Wombrahmina who has mapped but not disclosed its position. The competing Seam-Readers each take a section of the marked area. They press paws to the surface, move, press again, read. The first to correctly identify the stone's location without digging wins. How long is contested — the longest Listening Bore on record, according to oral tradition, lasted two full days and was won by a Seam-Reader who spent most of it drinking tea and periodically pressing one paw to the ground. She was widely suspected of knowing where the stone was from the first hour and waiting for dramatic effect.

**The Load Carry.** Not tunneling but raw strength: a standardized weight of clay, packed into a carry-frame, hauled through a course that includes inclines, tight turns, and a low section that requires the carrier to move on three limbs while maintaining the carry-frame with the fourth. The Load Carry is the most physically demanding competition and produces the most elaborate pre-competition rituals: specific foods the night before, particular warming exercises, the wrapping of paw-calluses with a clay-fibre binding that several Seam-Readers have proposed is actually structurally irrelevant and is maintained entirely for psychological reasons.

**The Patience Sit.** The oldest competition and the least explicable to outsiders. Competitors sit with paws flat on the earth of the the Round chamber for as long as they can maintain full attention — not endurance (falling asleep disqualifies), but active, present listening. Wombrahminas judge by a criterion they have never written down and could not, if pressed, fully articulate. They know what full attention looks like. They know when it has lapsed. Most competitors last forty minutes to two hours. The record, held by a Seam-Reader from a wombutz in the deep eastern tunnels, is seven hours and forty minutes, at the end of which she stood up and said what the earth had told her, and three of the four Wombrahminas present wept, and the fourth said she would have wept if she weren't on duty.

**The Bowl-Ring.** Each competing bowl-maker strikes their best bowl once. The bowl that rings longest and richest wins. Judged by the Wombrahminas and the assembled community together — the crowd's collective *ohhh* at the moment the harmonics fully open is part of the score. Morillaboo has won the Bowl-Ring eleven times. She claims not to compete anymore and then enters every time.

**The Strong Wombat.** Events vary by host wombutz — the hosting community proposes events, the Wombrahminas approve. Consistent events across generations include: the stone-roll (rolling a large stone as far as possible from a standing start), the hold (gripping a suspended clay weight for as long as possible), and the dig-carry (digging and immediately carrying what you've dug, up a slope, until you cannot). Strong Wombat competitions attract the largest crowds and the loudest argument about judging, and are the most common source of disputes that the Wombrahminas then spend two days quietly resolving.

**The Clay-Bread.** Judged blind. Each wombutz submits one loaf, baked to the community's standard recipe but with whatever variation the baker chooses. The Wombrahminas eat all entries and deliberate. The judging criteria, written nowhere, include: *would you eat a second piece unprompted, would you request the recipe, and does it taste like someone made it or like someone followed instructions.* Orrubat has won the Clay-Bread competition eight times across six different the Rounds. She denies caring about this and keeps count precisely.

---

### The Wail

The the Round ended with the communal Wail.

This was not competition. It was practice — the specific practice of multiple wombutzim bringing their bowls into the same chamber and letting the sound find itself through the clay. No conductor. No script. The bowl-makers struck their bowls in a sequence the room arrived at collectively, watching each other, listening to what the chamber returned, adjusting. The harmonics that emerged from multiple bowls in the same space were not predictable from the individual bowls — they were a conversation, the chamber a participant, the accumulated clay of many wombutzim's bowls speaking to the earth that had been waiting, in the dark, for exactly this.

The Wail at a the Round lasted until it was done. Some years it lasted an hour. Some years it lasted through the night into the following morning. The length was never the point. The point was what changed in the quality of the air — in the Groves, in the clay, in the earth below the the Round chamber — afterward. Seam-Readers consistently reported a different quality in the earth after a successful Wail. More attentive. More awake. As if the listening had been mutual.

Children were present for the Wail. Always. The tradition was deliberate: the sound was to be in their bodies before they had language for it, so that when the language arrived later, they would recognize it as naming something they already knew.

---

## The Wombrahminas

The Wombrahminas were not leaders. This distinction matters and was eventually fatal, because the Sovereigns did not recognize it.

A leader exercises authority within a fixed community. A Wombrahmina belonged to no fixed community — they lived between the wombutzim, moving continuously, staying where they were needed, departing when their staying was done. Their authority was horizontal and temporary: they had it because a specific situation needed it, and it dissolved when the situation resolved. No Wombrahmina accumulated power across seasons, because accumulation requires a home to accumulate in, and a Wombrahmina had none.

What they had instead: **relationship density.** A Wombrahmina knew everyone in every wombutz on their circuit — their capabilities, their history, their current need, their old grievances, their best clay sources, their bowl-making quality, their tunneler's blind spots. This knowledge was the medium of exchange. A Wombrahmina arriving at a wombutz didn't bring authority. They brought information that no one in the wombutz could have — what the neighboring communities were doing, what surplus existed elsewhere, what disputes were building that a third perspective could defuse before they compounded.

They also carried the songs.

The Wombrahminas were the transmission medium for the old songs, the old stories, the old practices. They memorized and carried what the wombutzim individually couldn't hold — the full corpus of Seam-Reader method, the deep history of the Dust-Bearers, the variant bowl-making techniques from distant wombutzim, the accumulated oral record of what the earth had done in previous cycles. They were the library that lived in movement. Each Wombrahmina was a different section of the collection; the collection only existed as a whole when Wombrahminas convened at the the Round and compared what they carried.

**Recognition:** Wombrahminas were recognized by a single object: a **resonance bell** worn or carried at the hip. Not a singing bowl — smaller, designed for open air, struck with a paw rather than a striker. Its sound carried differently from a bowl's, recognizable at distance as the particular timbre of a Wombrahmina's arrival. The bell also served a practical function: pressing it to clay walls in an unfamiliar tunnel and reading what came back gave a Wombrahmina a rapid assessment of the tunnel's health, the local clay composition, and whether the earth had anything particular to say.

**Selection:** You did not choose to become a Wombrahmina. The Wombrahminas chose you — at a the Round, after years of observation. The criteria were not written. They included: do you belong equally to multiple communities, do you carry information without distorting it, can you hold a dispute between two parties without taking a side, do you know what the earth is doing when you press your paws to it. The call, when it came, was delivered quietly, in private, by the senior Wombrahmina present. You could decline. Some did. Most who were called had already known they would be called — the path toward it had been visible for years, from the inside, even when they hadn't named it.

---

## The Sovereign Co-option

The Sovereigns arrived at wombat society and saw its most resourceful and widely-trusted members: the Wombrahminas. They were present in every wombutz. They were listened to. They traveled freely across territorial lines. They held the institutional memory. They had, in effect, the social infrastructure the Sovereigns needed to extend administrative reach across a population that had no administrative structure they could grab.

The error was foundational and deliberate: they treated the Wombrahminas as leaders and offered them the formal authority they'd never had.

Some accepted. Some did not. The ones who accepted received: an address, a title, a Tally-notch, a position in the nascent Cathedral's advisory structure. They became the founding generation of the High Noses — wombats who still carried the Wombrahmina's knowledge and relationship density, but now exercised it vertically, as authority, rather than horizontally, as connection. Within a generation, the knowledge degraded. Authority doesn't require the same precision as relationship. You can issue a ruling without understanding what you're ruling about. The original Wombrahminas knew this and said so. Their successors stopped needing to know it. The ones who did not eventually lost their circuits — the wombutzim they'd traveled between were registered, assessed, individualized, and no longer recognized the old horizontal relationship as carrying any weight. The unregistered Wombrahminas continued their work in the margins. The ones in the Groves and the unmapped zones maintained partial circuits for generations. They are now, in Hoebat's time, down to perhaps three or four on all of Melborow's eastern margin, doing the work with none of the reach.

**What the co-option did to the wombutzim:**

The registration of a wombutz was the beginning of its dissolution. Registration required the assignment of individual Tally-notches to each member — which meant each wombat now had a record, a number, a standing in the Cathedral's ledger that was theirs individually rather than the community's collectively. The communal tunnel became, legally, a shared easement over individually-held sections. The shared food store became a cooperative whose terms were governed by Cathedral contract rather than community practice. The commons kiln required a safety certification that cost more than most wombutzim's collective annual surplus, which was the point.

None of this was announced as dissolution. It was announced as *formalisation, recognition, integration into the broader civic structure.* Each step was framed as an improvement on what existed before — the registration was protection, the individual Tally-notch was security, the kiln certification was safety. The wombutzim that resisted were characterized as resistant to *modernisation,* which carried the same weight in administrative language as resistant to *safety,* which in turn carried the same weight as *dangerous.*

Within two generations, most wombutzim had completed the formal transition from collective to administered unit without any single moment you could point to and call the breaking. The breaking was distributed across ten thousand small decisions, each individually reasonable, collectively catastrophic. The Tally took the place of the community's memory of who needed what. The Cathedral certification replaced the bowl-maker's judgment of whether a bowl was good. The Safety Grout replaced the tunneler and listener working in tandem. Each replacement was technically functional. None of them were the same thing.

---

## What Survived

**The Groves** is the clearest extant wombutz in Melborow's eastern margin — and the clearest extant Lo Snout community. No Tally-notches on the burrows. No High Nose administrative standing in any family. The Council's assessment of *Unregistered, No Value* is the High Nose view of a Lo Snout space that has refused to be legible to the High Nose system. The wall's response — standing, stable, pre-formation clay, outlasting every assessment notice — is the Lo Snout answer. Unregistered, tunnel network paw-dug, no Safety Grout, no individual Tally-notches on the burrows. Children move freely between burrows. Agathaboo's drainage assessments are the wombutz's practical earth-reading in place of an institutionalized Seam-Reader guild. Morillaboo's workshop is the commons kiln, technically unlicensed, practically indispensable. The surface-farm market that runs on the last morning of the wet season is the the Round economy in miniature — no accounting, needs matched by relationship, the Wombrahmina logic preserved in the way Pellaboo's father's unofficial logbook tracks who goes up and when.

Orrubat is, in practical terms, the last functioning Wombrahmina on the Groves circuit. She holds no title, carries no resonance bell (hers broke three decades ago and the replacement materials are not accessible), travels less than a traditional Wombrahmina should, and has more opinions than any three normal wombats combined. But she knows every family in the Groves and three adjacent communities, carries their history, mediates their disputes, and when she arrives at your burrow entrance unannounced with strong opinions about your drainage channel, you listen. Not because she has authority. Because she's right, and you know it, and she knows you know it.

**The the Round does not happen in Hoebat's time.** The last one in the Groves circuit was held fifteen years before his birth. What replaced it: the market. It runs on the same days the the Round would have run — on the last morning of the wet season, on the turn of the dry — without anyone formally deciding to maintain the schedule. The wombutzim that once gathered are gone or registered or scattered, but the timing persists in the Groves like the groove in a well-worn tunnel. The body remembers the route.

**The Bowl-Ring survives** in a form no one calls by its name: whenever Morillaboo finishes a new bowl and strikes it for the first time, the Groves wombats who are nearby stop what they're doing and listen. If the bowl is good — if the harmonics open fully, if the clay answers — the sound is its own announcement. No judge is needed. Everyone present is the judge, and everyone present knows it when they hear it.

**The Wail** — as Cornelibat's stories trace, and as Hangbat has preserved in the deep tunnels — is not gone. It is underground, literally: practiced in the Root Cathedral and in the deep sections that no administrator has ever mapped, in spaces the Council calls Dead Zones and the earth simply calls home. Hoebat will find it. It found him first.

---

## Cultural Quirks

**Paws on floors.** The habit of pressing paws flat to the ground, which Hoebat practices constantly and which others find eccentric, is residual wombutz behavior. In a healthy wombutz, everyone had some version of this — the continuous low-grade listening to the tunnel network's state. It wasn't specialist behavior; it was how wombats stayed oriented to their shared infrastructure. Post-Sovereign atomization, with individually-owned sections and Grout-sealed walls that communicated nothing, made the habit look like eccentricity because the context that made it sensible had been removed. In the Groves, it's still normal. Grid-wombats notice it and find it strange. This is one of the clearest measures of how much has been lost.

**The bread.** Clay-pressed bread is not a neutral food in wombat culture. In the wombutz tradition, bread-baking was a commons function — the daily bread was the community's bread, made in the commons kiln, available to everyone. Its quality was public knowledge. The baker who made bad bread knew the whole wombutz would know it by tomorrow. This pressure produced, over generations, an extraordinary standard of clay-pressed bread in wombutz communities. In the post-Sovereign grid, where bread-baking became a household function and quality was private, the standard collapsed. The Groves still bakes well, because the memory is recent enough that the knowledge hasn't fully degraded. Grid-wombats who taste Groves bread for the first time routinely ask what the secret is. There is no secret. There is a community that still bakes together.

**The naming of cracks.** In wombutz tunnel-maintenance tradition, significant cracks in the network were named — given descriptive identifiers that became the community's shared vocabulary for its own infrastructure. *The Long One at the Third Junction.* *The Seeping Crack by Orrubat's entrance.* *The one that breathes.* This naming was practical: communication about maintenance required a shared reference. But it also produced a relationship between the community and its tunnels that was not purely utilitarian. You knew the names of the cracks in your network the way you knew the names of your neighbors. You noticed when they changed. The post-Sovereign grid replaces this with categorical flagging: Category 2 Compromise, Category 3 Failure. These categories are not wrong. But a Category 2 flag on the North-West Corridor springline, repeated unchanged for eight years until the springline fails, illustrates the difference between a system that tracks a crack and a community that knows one.

**The sitting.** In wombutz practice, it was not unusual for a wombat — particularly a Seam-Reader, but not exclusively — to simply sit in a tunnel, unoccupied, for an extended period. Not meditating, not resting. Attending. The community's understanding was that the earth communicated on its own schedule and you had to be available when it did. A Wombrahmina who sat for four days in an expansion bore before making her recommendation was not derelict. She was doing the work. The guild tried to classify this as non-billable. She filed the appeal herself.

**Orrubat's principle.** In the Groves, the following is understood without being stated: if Orrubat arrives at your entrance with opinions about something, the opinions are probably correct and the kindest thing you can do is listen without arguing for at least ten minutes before you engage, because she has already considered your counter-argument and dismissed it on good grounds, and the ten minutes saves you the embarrassment of discovering this in real time. This is not a formal principle. It is accumulated community wisdom operating as social protocol, which is what most wombutz culture eventually becomes.

## The Class Map (Book 1 Characters)

| Character | Class | Position |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Cornelibat** | Lo Snout | Ex-Seam-Reader, expelled from the guild. Groves. His expulsion was a High Nose administrative move against a Lo Snout who made the High Nose system look bad by being better at it. |
| **Agathaboo** | Lo Snout | Unlicensed drainage assessor. Runs the work the High Nose permit system can't be bothered to do, for the farms that need it done regardless of paperwork. |
| **Morillaboo** | Lo Snout | Unlicensed bowl-maker. Her workshop operates entirely outside Cathedral certification. The Cathedral knows it exists. It's not worth the administrative effort to shut down something this far into unregistered territory. |
| **Pellaboo** | Lo Snout | Inherits both the bowl-making and the Groves community knowledge. Her relocation to Sector 11 post-collapse is a High Nose move against a Lo Snout family — not punitive in intent, just convenient. The address was the price. |
| **Orrubat** | Lo Snout | The eldest Lo Snout on the Groves circuit. Functions as de facto Wombrahmina without the title, the bell, or any High Nose recognition of what she is. |
| **Hoebat** | Lo Snout | Born Lo Snout, trained in the Lo Snout tradition by Cornelibat and Morillaboo. Goes to the Academy — a High Nose institution — as a Lo Snout student. The tension this creates is the central institutional conflict of his Academy years. |
| **Tallibat** | Lo Snout (High Nose-adjacent) | His father is a Safety Grout inspector — a credentialed Lo Snout who has made himself useful to the High Nose infrastructure. The family has compliance standing without actual High Nose status. This is the most unstable class position: too invested in the system to reject it, too Lo Snout in origin to be protected by it when things fail. |
| **Barnabat** | High Nose | Cathedral Assessor family. Grew up with High Nose credential as ambient air. His curiosity about Lo Snout knowledge (the Dead Zones project) was genuine — but when the system required him to choose, High Nose standing was the floor he stood on, not the Lo Snout knowledge he'd been collecting. |
| **Barnabat's father** | High Nose | Senior Cathedral Assessor. Moves through institutions the way High Noses move — as if they were designed with him in mind, because for his family, they were. The witness statement he drafted for Barnabat to sign was not cruelty. It was maintenance. |
| **The High Auditor** | High Nose | The Cathedral's administrative reach into the Academy. The pre-decided Tally-stone is High Nose justice: the conclusion arrived at before the evidence, the form of process without its substance. |

**The class tension in the Academy chapters:** Hoebat is a Lo Snout in a High Nose institution, doing Lo Snout work (earth-listening, unlicensed excavation, oral tradition as research methodology) and trying to make the High Nose institution recognize it. The Pre-Grid Studies submission was, at its core, a Lo Snout attempting to legitimate Lo Snout knowledge through High Nose channels. Barnabat understood this intuitively — which is why he said *we document it properly and I put my father in the acknowledgments.* He was trying to High Nose-wash Lo Snout knowledge to get it through the door. The door closed anyway.
