Comprehensive index of terminology drawn from all `raw/meta/` documents.
Organized by category. Definitions based on source material.

## 1. COSMOLOGICAL & METAPHYSICAL TERMS

**Arnam** — The empathy-energy that sustains life; water-element, organic, fluid, connective; the fundamental frequency of the God-Kind's coherent heart.

**Black Static** — Contaminated Arnam; the feed from an incoherent human heart; destroys as it passes through systems designed for clean Arnam.

**Coherence** — The state of being in clear, open phase relationship; quantum condition where systems maintain consistent phase relationships; what allows crossing.

**Decoherence** — The loss of phase relationships; when quantum systems interact with their environment and collapse to definite classical states; the storage mechanism for trauma.

**The Closing Node** — The portal between Heart Worlds; the thinnest point where Hún Nico folds against adjacent Heart Worlds; located at the deepest level of Statborow.

**Elen Nico** — The star of Hún Nico; the transducer that converts Mirene's heart-field into physical light, warmth, and vibration that creatures can receive.

**The Float** — The state the Dog must maintain to filter the Feed; requires wombat-pillows from below and genuine worship from above.

**Heart Worlds** — Bubble universes generated by sleeping God-Kind; inverted physics created from the resonance-product of human consciousness.

**Hún Nico** — The Heart World sustained by Mirene's sleeping body; the primary setting of the saga.

**Incoherence** — The state of lost phase relationships; what Static produces; what decoherence creates.

**The Loop** — The wailing dance signal returning upward through the sealed Node to Mirene; the fundamental exchange that sustains everything.

**The Mahatahto** — Both the vibration and the philosophy: as vibration, it is the base resonance frequency that prevents the Arnam feed from decaying into entropy — the standing wave that holds the world together when all three realms breathe in coordination; as philosophy (also written Maha-Tahto), it is the three-fold doctrine of the Great Greyhound that explains the relationship between the three realms and their rotation.

**The Mahatahto Jitter** — The malfunction of the standing wave; what happens when contaminated feed arrives.

**The Morphic World** — The realm between Physical World and Heart Worlds; the Dog's domain where raw Arnam is transformed and filtered before descending.

**Mukti** — Liberation; the restoration of conditions under which manual crossing becomes possible again.

**Nāda** — Vibration; the frequency signature of a destination world; one of the two things a crosser must hold to open the Node.

**Om / Anahata** — The unstruck sound; the primordial vibration that exists before any physical action; the frequency of the coherent human heart.

**Avarodha** — Obstruction; the sealing of the Node and suppression of crossing knowledge.

**Phase Alignment** — When separate systems find each other's rhythm without one forcing the other.

**Rūpa** — Form; the image of the destination world; one of the two things a crosser must hold simultaneously to open the Node.

**Śruti** — Received resonance, not authored memory; the ancient mode of knowing that produces Songlines.

**The Scent of Arnam** — Rain on dry ground; what the world smells like when the system is working correctly.

**The Standing Wave** — The Mahatahto as solid resonant structure when all three worlds are in correct relationship.

**Static** — The structure-energy that creates form; fire/crystal element, geometric, ordering, rigid; necessary in proportion but deadly in excess.

**Static Addiction** — Psychological and physiological dependency on refined Static; the crash afterward when the hooks dissolve.

**Static ore** — Raw material harvested from pools and Slop-Pits; compressed into blocks for Grout production.

**Substrate Memory** — What the earth remembers; the geological record of thought forms and emotional history.

**Synchronicity** — Non-causal coordination; coherence experienced between separate systems; two oscillators finding each other's rhythm without one causing the other.

**The Tejas** — Sanskrit fire principle; the symmetry-breaking force that produces structure and form in the world.

---

## 2. THE THREE REALMS & WORLD NAMES

**Arnamland** — The collective name for the Many Heart Worlds; the cosmos of interconnected bubble universes.

**The Closing Membrane** — The boundary where Hún Nico meets the substrate below and the surface world above.

**The Fold** — The place where Heart Worlds press against adjacent worlds; the membrane that becomes thin at resonance convergence.

**Heart World** — The bubble universe below the membrane; sustained by the God-Kind above; inhabited by five species organized around the Mahatahto.

**Hún Nico** — The specific Heart World of the saga; see above.

**Melbourne** — The surface city above Hún Nico; where Mirene lives, where the Jacaranda tree first grew in a suburban garden.

**Morphic World** — The transformer station between Physical and Heart; the Dog's realm.

**Physical World** — The realm of humans, the surface world above the membrane; source of the Feed.

**The Sovereign World** — The Heart World from which the Five Sovereigns originated; further along the Static trajectory than Hún Nico; now partially failed.

**The Threshold** — The Morphic World; the space between realms; the doorstep where crossing happens.

## 3. CHAKRA / ENERGY SYSTEM

**Muladhara** (Root) — Earth element, 256 Hz, red; wombat frequency, earth-keeping, the substrate.

**Svadhisthana** (Sacral) — Water element, 288 Hz, orange; the Arnam rains, flow, abundance, the help economy.

**Manipura** (Solar Plexus) — Fire element, 320 Hz, yellow; Static in excess, power without the heart, the Tally's frequency.

**Anahata** (Heart) — Air element, 341 Hz, green; Arnam at its source, the unstruck sound, the wailing dance's frequency.

**Vishuddha** (Throat) — Ether element, 384 Hz, blue; the Songlines, Śruti, received truth moving through the world.

**Ajna** (Third Eye) — Light element, 427 Hz, indigo; the membrane between worlds, the perception that crosses the threshold, the Crossing's activation.

**Sahasrara** (Crown) — Consciousness element, 480 Hz, violet; connection beyond the self, inter-world consciousness, the Violet Miasma.

---

## 4. CORE DOCTRINES & TEACHINGS

**The Dingo Code** — The ethical essence of the Dingo tradition; originally a Condition Songline expressing the Dingo's sacred function of cleansing.

**The Grand Inversion** — The moment humans reversed D-O-G to G-O-D; the installation of a human-shaped God at the Apex; the beginning of Black Static as the primary feed.

**Kintsugi-Mu** — The practice of fracture-mending; the philosophy that breaks made stronger with their own material are more beautiful than seamless completion.

**Lambda** — The eleventh crossing of Kappa Mu; Hoebat (Wombat), Cooroo (Galah), Pokero (Dingo), Merl (Emu), and Bash (Wallaby).

**The Maha-Tahto** — See The Mahatahto; the philosophical/doctrinal spelling of the same term.

**Static vs. Faith** — The thematic constant; Static replaces the heart with mechanism, Faith participates through the heart's own knowing.

**The Three-Fold Rotation** — The principle that Godhood is relational, not fixed; each being takes a turn as Apex, Foundation, and Bridge depending on which realm they inhabit.

**Common Practise** — The ancient economic system based on gift rather than debt; the help economy that sustained the original integrated world. The name carries its own irony now: what was once common is the rarest thing in Hún Nico. The Moderns call it **The Old System**, and mean it as a dismissal.

**The Yuga Cycle** — The Dashavatara map; the oscillation between Satya Yuga (correct proportion) and Kali Yuga (maximum inversion), with the possibility of return.
