# The Wombat Aesthetic

*A style guide for writing wombat spaces. The fundamental rule: even the poorest, most oppressed wombats live in **burrows**, not sewers. The dignity is in the digging.*

---

## The Core Principle

**Wombats are master diggers.** Their architecture is not human infrastructure adapted to animals. It is evolved, organic, specific to their bodies and their relationship with the substrate.

Even under oppression:
- The Tally takes their labor, not their skill
- The Corvée claims their bodies, not their craft
- The Frequency disturbs their peace, not their dignity

The Lo Snouts are poor, indebted, overworked. But their **burrows are still burrows**—earthen, curved, wombat-scaled, maintained with skill and care.

## What to Avoid

| Don't Write | Why | Instead Write |
|-------------|-----|---------------|
| "Sewer pipes" | Wombats are not rats. Their tunnels are not human infrastructure. | "Curved tunnels," "warrens," "burrows" |
| "Sagging crowns" as collapse | Wombat tunnels are supposed to compress slightly. This is maintenance, not decay. | "The gentle compression of age," "settling earth" |
| "Weeping walls" as filth | Moisture in clay tunnels is natural. The "weep" is the substrate breathing. | "The mineral seep that keeps the clay alive," "moisture threaded through the earth" |
| "Clogged sumps" as stagnant pools | Wombats manage water through clay-pack and gravity. | "Collection chambers," "water gathered in low places" |
| "The stench" | Wombats are clean animals. Their spaces smell of clay, root, community—not filth. | "The mineral scent of deep earth," "the particular smell of family proximity" |
| "Crammed" / "cramped" | Wombats sleep close by choice. This is coziness, not overcrowding. | "Intimate," " wombat-scaled," "embracing curves" |
| "Vermin" / "scurrying" | Never. | "Moving with purpose," "digging with skill" |

## The Lo Snout Aesthetic

**The Gray Grotto is not a slum.** It is:

- **Dense**: Tunnels woven closely because wombats thrive on community proximity
- **Organic**: Curves following the substrate's logic, not engineered straight lines
- **Tended**: Clay-pack repairs done by families, visible as history not neglect
- **Intimate**: Spaces scaled to wombat bodies, embracing rather than constraining
- **Alive**: Moisture, root-threads, the mineral breath of deep earth

**The dignity is in the maintenance.** A Lo Snout burrow shows:
- Generational notches in the clay (lineage, not graffiti)
- Hand-smoothed walls (care, not roughness)
- Specific clay-pack recipes passed mother-to-joey (skill, not desperation)
- Shared spaces tended collectively (community, not abandonment)

## The Cathedral Aesthetic (Contrast)

**The Cathedral is not "better"—it is different, and the difference is revealing:**

| Gray Grotto | Cathedral |
|-------------|-----------|
| Clay (living, yielding, remembering) | Grout (dead, rigid, screaming) |
| Curves (organic, wombat-scaled) | Straight lines (engineered, imposed) |
| Family notches (personal history) | No marks (no personal history permitted) |
| Intimate darkness (wombat-appropriate) | Bright synthetic light (human-scaled) |
| Moisture (the earth breathing) | Dry (the earth excluded) |
| Sound that carries (acoustic community) | Sound that controls (acoustic surveillance) |

The Grotto is **warren**. The Cathedral is **cage**.

The oppression is not that the Grotto is "bad"—it is that the Grotto is **under pressure**, while the Cathedral is **dead**.

## Sensory Language Guide

### Touch
- **Clay**: Cool, yielding, remembers pressure, responds to paw-heat
- **Grout**: Cold, rigid, indifferent, screams under stress
- **Root-threads**: Living, slightly yielding, the substrate's own architecture
- **Tended walls**: Smooth from generations of touch, not polished but worn-with-care

### Sound
- **Grotto**: Murmur of family life through clay, the natural resonance of curved tunnels
- **Cathedral**: Amplified, controlled, artificial—sound as surveillance
- **Grid Tunnels**: Dead, no resonance, the silence of excluded earth

### Smell
- **Clay**: Mineral, alive, the scent of deep earth
- **Root**: Organic, nourishing, the smell of sustenance
- **Community**: Distinct but not unpleasant—the scent of healthy proximity
- **Grout**: Absence, sterility, the smell of nothing-alive

### Light
- **Grotto**: Low, wombat-appropriate, fungal or bioluminescent, shadows that embrace
- **Cathedral**: Bright, human-scaled, synthetic, shadows that expose

## The Emotional Tone

**Even when describing poverty and oppression, maintain dignity:**

**Wrong:** "The Lo Snouts lived in crumbling tunnels, damp and cramped, scrambling for survival."

**Right:** "The Lo Snouts lived in the Grotto—dense with community, their burrows hand-tended, the clay marked with generations of care. The Tally took their labor. The Wall took their strength. But the digging remained theirs."

**Wrong:** "Hoebat fled to the drainage vault, a filthy hole in the sewer system."

**Right:** "Hoebat found the drainage vault—a maintenance chamber, built and abandoned, the clay still breathing, the air still moving. He made it his."

---

## The Key Distinction

**Human poverty** is often characterized by abandonment—spaces left to decay, infrastructure failing, the environment itself becoming hostile.

**Wombat oppression** is characterized by **extraction**—their skill is taken, their labor claimed, their coherence harvested. But the environment itself, the burrow, the clay, the digging—these remain **theirs**, maintained with skill and dignity, even under pressure.

The tragedy is not that they live in "bad conditions."

The tragedy is that they live in **good conditions that are being slowly destroyed** by the Grid, the Grout, the Frequency—the Council's attempt to replace living architecture with dead infrastructure.

## Reference: Authentic Wombat Spaces

| Space | Description | Tone |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Family Burrow** | Curved chambers, generational notches, sleeping nests lined with gathered materials, the hearth where food is shared | Cozy, intimate, wombat-scaled |
| **The Grotto** | Dense warren of tended tunnels, community proximity, shared maintenance, the organic compression of age | Community, dignity-under-pressure |
| **The Root Cathedral** | Ancient chamber shaped by roots, extraordinary acoustics, the resonance of living clay | Sacred, pre-Imperial, alive |
| **The Grid Tunnels** | Straight lines, poured Grout, no resonance, no moisture, no life | Dead, imposed, wrong |
| **The Crystal Plains** | Perfect hexagons, geometric sterility, the lattice's victory | Beautiful, terrible, the absence of life |

---

*When in doubt: ask if a space feels **dug** or **built**. Wombat spaces are dug—shaped by living bodies in relationship with living earth. The Council's spaces are built—imposed, engineered, dead.*
