# What Is Clear: Defined & Consistent Elements

*These elements are well-developed, internally consistent, and ready to write from.*

---

## Cosmology

### The Arnam / Static Duality ✓
Fully defined. Arnam = empathy-energy, organic, fluid, the signal of living things in relationship. Static = crystalline logic, the skeleton of the world, lethal only at excess. The ratio broke when humans traded empathy for efficiency. Neither force is evil in itself — the catastrophe is the imbalance.

### The Static as Tejas ✓
The revision from "Static is poison" to "Static is fire — necessary in proportion" is complete and consistent. The Jacaranda doesn't fight the Static; it disperses it. The Grout's error was blocking (impossible) rather than fractalizing (possible).

### The Coring Trees — Why They Died ✓
Crystal clear: the taproots drank from the poisoned source. The deeper the root, the faster the infection. The wombats' love of verticality (Depth = Truth) accelerated the collapse. The Jacaranda survives by doing the opposite: shallow, lateral, fractal, floating on the Static like a raft.

### The Jacaranda ✓
Function: biological prism, metabolizes Static into Violet light. Root system: horizontal braid, collectivist, interlocking — creates Compassion Gaps (moisture pockets) by being too wide and messy to tile. The Violet Miasma: atmospheric byproduct, healing frequency, pressure dome, RF dampener. The Fractal Rainforest: the new biome it anchors.

## Wombat Civilization

### The Tally — Three-Stage Betrayal ✓
Stage 1 (Relief Tablet / Gift), Stage 2 (Mandatory Registry / Duty), Stage 3 (Instrument of Debt) — the arc from mutual aid to permanent bondage is fully developed and historically coherent.

### The Frequency ✓
Muskbat's synthetic Arnam-substitute. Triggers manageable fight-or-flight rather than genuine empathy. Contains the entombed frequencies of the Wombiki. Vara's last resonance is woven into it. This is both the city's pacification tool and its most horrifying secret.

### The Well-Field Way vs The Tally ✓
The before/after is complete: nine-square communal grid → Imperial property sectors; gift of Arnam → metered Tally-debt; Puddles → Mega-Pool reservoirs; Songlines → Tally-stones; the Umbilical → the Sovereign. The Great Inversion table is solid.

### The Five Borows — Atmosphere ✓
Each Borow has a distinct vibe, landscape, and governing logic:
- Central: gilded cage, Cathedral, religious authority
- Queensborow: mirror economy, status performance, Social Mining
- Brookborow: technical debt, Gray Grotto, gentrification of the working class
- Bronxborow: honest brutality, the Tally Vaults, Dingo enforcement
- Statborow: the Archive, the forgotten, the Closing Node

### The Five Sovereigns ✓
Each is individually distinct with a clear archetype, domain, and characteristic lie:
- Trumbat: Golden Protector / Infrastructure as religion
- Muskbat: Technocratic Vigilante / The next invention will fix everything
- Tatebat: Visionary Narcissist / The cage is a masterpiece
- Vitabat: The Invisible Constant / The Tally is the only order
- Zuckbat: The Omniscient Censor / Dissonance is the only threat

### The Guild Inversions ✓
The before/after structure of every professional role — from Kintsugi-Mu to Grout-Engineer, from Aquifer-Mu to Metering Official — is developed and thematically consistent. The core insight (every sacred function inverted into extraction) is clearly established.

### The Wombiki and the Baram Schism ✓
The Consecration as industrial cover-up is fully developed. The Beautiful Snare (luxury-as-captivity), the Efficacy Gap (no evidence the sacrifice worked), Trumbat's admission ("we are selling Hope"), Howlbaram's Broken Spiral intervention, Vara's murder and absorption into the Frequency — all consistent and dramatically potent.

### The Social Strata ✓
High Noses / Lo Snouts / Ghost-Diggers / Outlawed — the class system is clear and functions consistently throughout the narrative.

## Characters

### Hoebat ✓
Complete origin arc: Eucalyptus Groves → Academy → Collapse → Silencing → Fracture with Cornelibat → Ghost-Digger years → Hangbat → Kintsugi-Mu training → Gorge → Cooroo encounter. His skill (True Kintsugi-Mu), his wound (betrayal by Barnabat, father's compliance), his voice (first person, dense and sensory) are all established.

### Cooroo ✓
Complete origin arc: Silver Wattle falls → mum's grief-trance → Morning Glory vine calls → the crossing of the Heavy Breath → Wedgie encounter → Merl on the Steppe → the Jacaranda → the vision of the Fractal Rainforest and the Five Inheritors. Voice established (first person, comic-heroic, self-aware about being ridiculous).

### Hoebat & Pokero's relationship ✓
The Lambda class survival mission, the Haiku game, the Dingo Code lessons, the campfire nights — the foundation of their bond is fully realized. The Click scene (Hoebat decoding Pokero's parting words) is complete and emotionally coherent.

### Hangbat (Howlbaram) ✓
History, function, mask, tools, and secret (Beta class — though Hoebat doesn't know) all established. The jar of silence as anti-resonance equipment. The Watcher's Frequency. His deliberate cultivation of Hoebat for Lambda. His choice to stay in the drainage vault rather than surface.

### Cornelibat ✓
The architecture of his character — exiled for compassion, rebuilt himself around compliance, tells stories he won't stand behind — is fully present. His last moment (pressing his forehead to the living wall) is written.

---

## Kappa Mu

### The Greek Fraternity Model ✓
Structure established: the Jacaranda as chapter house, the Crossing as initiation, Greek letter classes, each class = five members (one per Inheritor species), the mission = return to home society and spread the ethos.

### Lambda Class Composition ✓
Hoebat (Wombat), Cooroo (Galah), Pokero (Dingo), Merl (Emu), Bash (Wallaby). One from each Inheritor species. Five complementary Siddhis.

### The Macro-Cosmic Theory ✓
The closed loop (animal fragmentation feeds human Static feeds animal fragmentation) and the open loop reversal (animal unity softens the substrate, humans feel connection is possible) are established as the organizing theory behind Kappa Mu's existence.

### Hangbat as Beta Class ✓
The dramatic irony is established: Hoebat doesn't know. The implication — that Hangbat prepared Hoebat deliberately, that Lambda is running on infrastructure Beta built — is clear.

### The Operational Security Model ✓
Classes don't know each other's composition. The movement is cellular. This is both a survival mechanism and a source of future dramatic revelation.

## Lore Systems

### Emu Martial Forms (Palar-Kuruswar) ✓
Foundation stances, Drum-Talk rhythms, Kinetic Forms, the Forbidden Style (the Rider's Stance that Merl broke), and the Friction Engine (kinetic return, tendons as springs) — all developed in detail and consistently applied in Cooroo's story.

### Avian Lexicon (Vilya-Lambë) ✓
The atmospheric strata (Thúlë Lunga, Súrë Axan, Lusta Ómëa), navigational textures, thermal and dynamic lift, currents, topographical features, and avian slang — all internally consistent. Applied throughout Cooroo's chapter.

### The Dingo Code ✓
Click-clack, hiss, pause. The Watcher's Frequency. The Haiku game as battle of composure. The Obsidian Sight. Applied in Chapter 3 (the Grotto alley scene).

### The Violet Miasma / Violet Sanctuary ✓
Physical, olfactory, and psychoactive properties established. Healing mechanisms (bone-mending, neural wash, paw restoration, deep sleep). The terraforming function (spore cloud that softens crystal lattice). The political controversy (Anti-Jacaranda factions reading it as drugging/invasion).

---

## The Narrative Voice

### Australian Lyrical Grotesque ✓
The 80% Malouf / 20% Jennings voice is established and working across multiple chapters. Key markers: sensory density, long breathing sentences with short punches, Australian vernacular elevated to poetry, natural world as consciousness, the wrong note that sits without explanation, ending on image rather than meaning.

### First-Person POV convention ✓
Chapters follow individual characters in first person. Established for Hoebat (Chapters 3, 4) and Cooroo (Chapter 2). Consistent tone within each POV while remaining distinctly different between characters.

---

## Story Structure

### The Five-Chapter Origin Arc ✓
Each Lambda member has a 10-beat origin structure (established in Hoebat's beats document). The arc: ordinary world → training/awakening → collapse/betrayal → exile/descent → teacher/revelation → skill acquisition → the crossing → return → mission.

### Chapter 4 (Hoebat's origin) ✓
Complete in two versions: the existing draft and the v1 with the Australian Lyrical Grotesque voice applied. Ten chapters, all beats covered.

### Chapter 2 (Cooroo's origin) ✓
Complete. Morning Glory → flight → Wedgies → Merl → Jacaranda → the vision.

### Chapter 3 (Hoebat in Melborow) ✓
Complete. The rain, the Gray Grotto, Lolaboo, the Dingo encounter, the Haiku game backstory, the Click revelation.
