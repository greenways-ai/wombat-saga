# The Wombat Saga — Meta Document Index

*The master navigation map. Eleven documents organised into four sections. Each section answers a different question about the world. Read in order for full context. Navigate directly when writing a specific scene.*

## How to Use These Documents

**Starting cold?** Read in this order: `01-world/original-world.md` → `01-world/world-structure.md` → `02-movement/jacaranda-agenda.md` → `04-story/five-act-structure.md`. That sequence gives you the world, the stakes, the tree's real agenda, and the shape of the whole story.

**Writing a scene?** Check `04-story/what-is-clear.md` for confirmed decisions and `04-story/open-questions.md` for what's still undefined. Don't write into an open question unless you're resolving it — note the resolution in `what-is-clear.md`.

**Checking a character?** Each Lambda member's mission and community context is in `01-world/world-structure.md`. Each thread's function in the material force of the endgame is in `03-politics/material-force.md`.

**The politics?** `03-politics/political-asymmetry.md` for the structural logic. `03-politics/material-force.md` for the realpolitik of how the system collapses. `03-politics/sovereign-trap.md` for the co-optation threat and Hoebat's five escapes.

## Section 01 — The World

*What exists, how it works, what it costs.*

### `01-world/original-world.md`
The integrated world before the Static crisis. Each species' sacred function in detail. The help economy. The Arnam rains. What restoration actually means (and why it creates a different world, not the old one back). **Read first** — everything else is understood against this baseline.

### `01-world/world-structure.md`
The world as it currently exists. Each of the five communities — their structure, their corruption, their current state, and Lambda's mission within them. Includes all five Lambda members' mission threads, supporting nations (Drop Bears, Platypus, Rosella, Dog-Brahman), and a cross-reference table of what each species lost and what Kappa Mu is trying to restore.

### `01-world/the-closing-node.md`
The portal between Heart Worlds. The cosmological scale: Mirene generates billions of Heart Worlds continuously; each lasts a fleeting moment from outside and millions of years from within. The Closing Node is the fold where Heart Worlds touch. Why only wombats know — the deepest-burrowing species are the only ones who reach it, in every Heart World. The Sovereign origin: five wombats from a more advanced but failing Heart World who crossed into Hún Nico, sealed the Node behind them, and used their imported knowledge to seize control. Their motivation was power — they wanted to rule, to be the closest thing to Gods the world would permit; they paid lip service to Mirene but never practiced. Every Heart World they visited was Static-saturated (their data set catastrophically incomplete). The Jacaranda was absent from every world they visited — it falls entirely outside their framework. The wailing dance is not suppressed but mocked as primitive superstition — their most consequential blind spot. The Node has been sealed since their arrival. The Jacaranda grows directly above the Node. What happens when the Node opens.

### `01-world/static-economy.md`
The oil-and-cocaine model. Three grades of Static (ambient / refined / productised), who controls them, how the Grout production cycle works, who benefits and who pays. The Kangaroo pool system. The Koala Lyptus binder supply chain. The Dingo harvest relationship. The dependency web, and the three conditions required for the path out.

---

## Section 02 — The Movement

*What the Jacaranda is, what the Kappa Mu became, and what happens when genuine transformation meets institutional power.*

### `02-movement/jacaranda-agenda.md`
The hidden spine of the story. The Jacaranda as pioneer species, not benevolent guide. The Crossing as curation, not recognition. The Violet Miasma as a terraforming instrument. What the Fractal Rainforest actually replaces. The Hangbat arc — why he sees the Jacaranda as a betrayal of the Crossing, why he is paralysed, how Hoebat becomes his way out of that paralysis. Lambda's choice: two options, neither clean. The last image. **Contains the story's moral ambiguity in full.**

### `02-movement/jacaranda-movement.md`
The public life of the Kappa Mu. How the underground became a rumour, the rumour became a culture, and the culture became a religion. The two named sects (Root Keepers / Violet Seekers). The full slang lexicon — genuine language and co-opted language distinguished. The Tatebat co-optation dynamic. Hoebat's reverse co-optation tactic — entering the imitation form and filling it with genuine substance. The seed-planting as triple act.

### `02-movement/the-god-kind.md`
The cosmological foundation. Who the God-Kind are and what they actually are (quantum resonance from human bodies, not divine beings). Mirene — the Sleeping World-Maker, her origin story, how she appears in visions. The origin of the Jacaranda: Mirene fell asleep under a Jacaranda tree above Melbourne; the resonance of her sleeping body seeded the Heart World tree. Each community's God-Kind (Brenn / Duro / Sett / Pela / Maren). How the Sovereign priesthood became the Censorate. The loop — how the wailing dance works as biofeedback, how it broke, what restoration requires. What no creature in Hún Nico knows about any of this.

### `02-movement/the-songlines.md`
The oldest system in Hún Nico — older than the Kappa Mu, older than the Imperial system. What Songlines are (received resonance from the God-Kind above, not authored memory), the four types (Location, Event, Condition, Warning), and who carries them. The Mnemo-Mu carriers. The Rosella Parliament as the index — what was lost when it shattered, what wasn't. The wailing dance as the oldest surviving Event Songline (the record of Mirene's arrival). The Tally-stone as cosmological replacement (from *what you carry* to *what you owe*). The Crossing and Songlines. What restoration actually means — a partial network, active, sufficient for signal to travel again.

### `02-movement/co-optation-doctrine.md`
Why co-optation happens and how it destroys ideas. Seven mechanisms of destruction (signal contamination, meaning dilution, original becoming fringe of itself, defensive corruption, energy drainage, legitimacy inversion, the closed door). Why Hoebat's doctrine-building response is also a trap. The antithesis table: what Hangbat gave vs. what Hoebat does with it. The broader pattern — every counterculture becomes a culture.

---

## Section 03 — The Politics

*How power works, how it fails, and why Hoebat wins by force not just by message.*

### `03-politics/political-asymmetry.md`
The structural imbalance between the Sovereign system (deep but narrow) and the Kappa Mu (broad but initially shallow). The Wombat Only Card — what it reveals about the Council's limits. The Dingo Irony — the enforcement arm is the community Lambda is working within. The five-species protection network in practice: each Lambda thread's specific tactical function. The danger in the meantime — the gap between institutional survival and individual suffering. Why the Sovereigns cannot ultimately win.

### `03-politics/material-force.md`
The realpolitik of the endgame. The four pillars of Sovereign control and how each Lambda thread attacks one. The cascade failure logic — how intensification accelerates collapse. The Frequency dependency problem — why "winning badly" is an actual risk, and why the seed timing is a strategic constraint, not a symbolic one. What "winning" actually looks like: not a coup but a system becoming non-functional. **The answer to: does Hoebat win by force or by message?**

### `03-politics/sovereign-trap.md`
The most dangerous threat to Hoebat's mission is not suppression — it is embrace. Trumbat's claim (the Wall was always the Jacaranda's cradle, the Corvée was sacred labor). Tatebat's claim (Hoebat is my successor). Why verbal response feeds the machine. The five ways out: the wailing dance (legally dangerous to claim), give it away (help economy at movement scale), Hangbat comes out (witness with nothing to gain), name the mechanism once specifically, disappearance (the ungovernable final act). What the trap cannot ultimately touch.

---

## Section 04 — The Story

*Confirmed decisions, open questions, and the full narrative architecture.*

### `04-story/five-act-structure.md`
The full narrative arc from origin to bloom. Five acts with dramatic questions, key beats, parallel Lambda arcs, and the personal/macro story integrated. Act 1: The Broken World. Act 2: The Roots Take Hold. Act 3: Surfacing. Act 4: The Cost. Act 5: The Seed. Includes structural summary table and thematic spine — the same question asked at increasing depth across all five acts.

### `04-story/what-is-clear.md`
The confirmed creative bible. Everything that has been decided: the original integrated world, the Jacaranda's nature, the Kappa Mu structure, each community's current state and Lambda mission, the Static economy, Hangbat's full arc, the movement's public life, the political endgame. **Check this before making decisions that might contradict established facts.**

### `04-story/open-questions.md`
What remains undecided, organised by urgency. Priority 1 (story-blocking), Priority 2 (world-defining), Priority 3 (enrichment). The Crossing ceremony, Bash's full character, non-wombat community documents, Kappa Mu class history, Drop Bear story role. Standing inconsistencies. **Check this before writing scenes that touch undefined territory.**

## Quick Reference: The Five Lambda Members

| Member | Species | Mission | Key Tactical Function |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Hoebat** | Wombat | Restore the wailing dance / Kappa Mu primary | Doctrine, movement leadership, seed-planting |
| **Pokero** | Dingo | Restore the Dingo Code from inside the Packs | Enforcement hollowing — makes Censorate operations fail |
| **Cooroo** | Galah | Restore the Noble Noise as living intelligence | Surveillance — 40-minute advance warning of all operations |
| **Bash** | Wallaby | Restore the translation function between communities | Secure communication — five languages, uncensorable |
| **Merl** | Emu | Walk the old paths, keep egress open | Logistics — pre-Wall paths that can't be sealed |

## Quick Reference: The Sovereign System

| Pillar | Mechanism | Lambda Attack | Threshold Failure |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Enforcement | Dingo Pack contracts | Pokero hollows Code from inside | Pack publicly refuses a direct order |
| Surveillance | Censorate resonance bells | Cooroo gives 40-min advance warning | Censorate arrives to find empty room — publicly |
| Resource control | Tally / Mega-Pool metering | Kangaroo mob shift creates external pockets | Matriarch refuses to pool; Council cannot enforce |
| Communication | Censorate bell calibration | Bash operates in four uncalibrated frequencies | Coordination never intercepted; crackdowns always reactive |

*Last updated: Closing Node rewritten (Sovereigns as immigrants from another Heart World, seeking to be rulers/Gods, mocking the wailing dance). Loop Logic heresy removed from Hangbat. Wailing dance mocked not suppressed — updated across all documents. Trilogy structure confirmed: Book 1 ends with Sovereigns at peak power (co-optation looks like it's working), Book 2 ends with secrets revealed and the Node opening, Book 3 ends with the rain. Founding myths drafted (Om, Nāda, Dvāram, Mukti). Witness options for Sovereign alien origin documented.*
