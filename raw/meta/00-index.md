## How to Use These Documents

**Starting cold?** Read in this order: `01-world/original-world.md` → `01-world/world-structure.md` → `02-movement/jacaranda-agenda.md` → `04-story/nine-act-structure.md`. That sequence gives you the world, the stakes, the tree's real agenda, and the shape of the whole story.

**Writing a scene?** Check `04-story/what-is-clear.md` for confirmed decisions and `04-story/open-questions.md` for what's still undefined. Don't write into an open question unless you're resolving it — note the resolution in `what-is-clear.md`.

**Checking a character?** Each Lambda member's mission and community context is in `01-world/world-structure.md`. Each thread's function in the material force of the endgame is in `03-politics/material-force.md`.

**The politics?** `03-politics/political-asymmetry.md` for the structural logic. `03-politics/material-force.md` for the realpolitik of how the system collapses. `03-politics/sovereign-trap.md` for the co-optation threat and Hoebat's five escapes.

**Writing style?** `01-world/wombat-aesthetic.md` for the crucial distinction: wombats are master diggers, not sewer rats. Their spaces are **warrens**, not pipes—dignified even under oppression.

## Quick Reference: The Five Lambda Members

| Member | Species | Mission | Key Tactical Function |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **Hoebat** | Wombat | Restore the wailing dance | Doctrine, movement leadership, seed-planting |
| **Pokero** | Dingo | Restore the Dingo Code | Enforcement hollowing — Censorate operations fail |
| **Cooroo** | Galah | Restore the Noble Noise | Surveillance — 40-minute advance warning |
| **Bash** | Wallaby | Restore translation | Secure communication — five languages |
| **Merl** | Emu | Walk the old paths | Logistics — pre-Wall egress routes |

## Quick Reference: The Sovereign System

| Pillar | Mechanism | Lambda Attack | Threshold Failure |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Enforcement | Dingo Pack contracts | Pokero hollows Code | Pack publicly refuses order |
| Surveillance | Censorate bells | Cooroo gives 40-min warning | Censorate finds empty room |
| Resource control | Tally / Mega-Pool | Kangaroo shift | Matriarch refuses to pool |
| Communication | Censorate calibration | Bash in uncalibrated frequencies | Coordination never intercepted |

## The Golden Rule (From `wombat-aesthetic.md`)

**Wombats are master diggers.** Even the poorest Lo Snouts live in **burrows**, not sewers. The dignity is in the digging.

- **Dug** spaces: curved, organic, wombat-scaled, clay that yields
- **Built** spaces: straight, engineered, Grout that screams

The Grotto is a **warren**—dense with community, hand-tended, the gentle compression of age. Not a slum. Not pipes. **Burrows.**
