# Co-optation and Doctrine — Why Movements Destroy Themselves

*The mechanism by which genuine transformation gets absorbed, neutralised, and reflected back as imitation. How the Jacaranda movement is vulnerable to this. And why Hoebat's response — doctrine — is both necessary and its own form of the same problem.*

## Why Co-optation Happens

Genuine transformation is visible from outside even when its content is invisible. Something real generates real energy — real community, real feeling, real change in the creatures who touch it. That energy radiates. It's attractive. The co-opter is drawn to the power without understanding its source, the way you're drawn to the warmth of a fire without understanding combustion.

**Status economies run on scarcity signals.** The first thing a secret society, an underground movement, a genuine spiritual practice has is exclusivity — not everyone knows about this. That *not-everyone-knows* quality is itself a status signal, entirely separate from what the thing actually contains. Tatebat doesn't need to understand the Jacaranda to understand that knowing about it before others do makes him look perceptive. The symbol becomes currency before anyone examines what it's backed by.

**Institutions contain what they cannot suppress.** The Council cannot locate the Kappa Mu — it's too cellular, too distributed. Tatebat instinctively understands a second option: if you aestheticize something, make it fashionable, make it a lifestyle choice, you neutralise its political threat without needing to find it. You don't suppress the movement. You drown it in imitation until the genuine article is indistinguishable from the decorative version. The beret becomes a costume. The revolutionary becomes a t-shirt. The root-braid becomes Cathedral stonework.

**The commercial logic is irresistible.** Once something demonstrates it generates loyalty, community, genuine feeling — there is always an incentive to package that feeling and distribute it at scale. The package can be manufactured. The genuine article cannot. So the package proliferates and the genuine article becomes scarce in its own landscape.

## How Co-optation Destroys the Idea

**Signal contamination — the movement cannot recognise itself.**
The root-braid on a wall was a navigation signal. *Kappa Mu was here. Trust this route.* Once High Nose decorators put it on Cathedral stonework, the signal is gone — not suppressed, flooded. Genuine laterals cannot use their own iconography for identification because it now belongs to everyone and therefore means nothing. The movement's internal language is its immune system. Co-optation is an autoimmune disease.

**Meaning dilution through decontextualised use.**
Words carry meaning through consistent use in context. Every time *down-deep* is said by someone who has never been near the Jacaranda, the word loses a fraction of its precision. Said enough times by enough creatures who don't mean it, the word becomes approximate. Approximate language cannot transmit exact ideas. The doctrine Hoebat is trying to build keeps slipping because the vocabulary he needs has already been half-emptied.

**The original becomes the fringe of its own movement.**
Once the co-opted version is mainstream, the genuine article looks like the extreme version. Lo Snouts who have absorbed the Tatebat aesthetic feel they already understand the Jacaranda — they've processed it, formed an opinion, moved on. When they encounter genuine Kappa Mu, they experience not curiosity but the irritation of being told something you already know is more complicated than you thought. The creatures who have actually been root-read, who actually practice in the cloth — they look fanatical compared to the comfortable majority who believe it decoratively. The original is now the radical fringe of itself.

**Defensive corruption — the living thing calcifies.**
The genuine movement, in response to co-optation, becomes more rigid, more exclusive, more dogmatic — building walls around the genuine article to protect it. Orthodoxy. Purity tests. The demand that you prove you are in the cloth before you are trusted with anything real. These walls work, to a point. They also transform the open, fluid, embodied thing into an institution with a gatekeeping function. The movement that was resisting Tally logic starts running on Tally logic: who is registered, who is approved, who has paid their dues.

**The energy is finite and co-optation spends it.**
The symbol's power runs on the genuine feeling of genuine believers. Every time a creature uses it without substance, they draw on that energy without replenishing it. The Violet aesthetic in Queensborow is running on the actual transformative power of the Jacaranda experience — borrowed and not returned. Dilute it far enough and the symbol stops evoking anything in anyone, including genuine believers who can no longer say *the braid* without hearing Tatebat's crowd say it back.

**Legitimacy inversion — the copy becomes the original.**
The co-opted version, backed by institutional visibility and cultural saturation, becomes the real thing in public perception. The original becomes counterfeit in its own name. Hoebat has to prove the Kappa Mu is the authentic version of a movement that Tatebat's crowd has been performing for two seasons. He is arguing with a forgery that got to market first.

**The closed door — inoculation against the real thing.**
The Crossing is an experience of being completely known. The entire apparatus of the Kappa Mu runs on the fact that this experience is real and it changes you. Tatebat's crowd has never had it. But they perform its language, and the performance is comfortable, and comfortable performances spread faster than uncomfortable truth.

So now there is a large population of wombats who feel they understand what the Crossing is — they've heard the slang, seen the iconography, absorbed the vibe — and who are therefore inoculated against actually encountering it. They've had the dead version and it satisfied something. They don't know they're hungry for the real thing because the imitation filled enough of the space.

This is the most precise damage: co-optation doesn't just empty the symbol. It closes the door in the creatures who most needed it open.

## Why Hoebat Builds Doctrine — And Why It's a Trap

His doctrine-building is the rational response to co-optation. Make the genuine article precisely and publicly itself. Give it a form coherent enough that the imitation becomes obviously hollow by contrast. When the doctrine surfaces, every creature who has been *wearing violet* for seasons finds themselves holding a symbol whose meaning has just been publicly defined — and the definition does not flatter what they were doing with it.

But doctrine is itself a mild form of the same problem.

Hangbat taught the old ways as practice — embodied, lived, danced, repaired with hands. Not systematised. The wailing dance cannot be written down without becoming instructions, and instructions are not the dance. Hoebat responds to the theft of the practice by systematising it. He protects the dance by writing down the steps.

Written steps are not the dance.

He knows this. He does it anyway. Because the alternative is Tatebat's version becoming definitive and the genuine article disappearing entirely. He chooses the lesser corruption to prevent the greater one.

That choice — protecting the living thing by partially killing it — is the deepest antithesis to what Hangbat gave him. Hangbat taught him to repair fractures with gold clay, to make the break stronger than the original. What Hoebat does with the doctrine is cover the fracture with Grout. Smooth. Sealed. The break is invisible. And something is lost in that invisibility that Kintsugi would have kept.

## The Broader Truth

Co-optation is the world's immune response to genuine transformation. No world — animal or human — can tolerate transformation it cannot absorb and neutralise. So it sells the shape of the transformation, and the shape, once widely distributed, inoculates the population against the real thing. They feel they have had the experience because they have had the aesthetic of the experience.

Every counterculture becomes a culture. Every revolution becomes an institution. Every genuine spiritual movement becomes a religion. The Kappa Mu is not exempt. Hoebat, in building the doctrine, is not failing — he is simply arriving at the stage every movement arrives at, earlier than he wanted to, with clearer eyes than most.

The question the story leaves open: what does he carry through that stage that the doctrine cannot hold? What remains in the cloth when the cloth itself becomes a uniform?

## The Antithesis in Full

| What Hangbat gave him | What Hoebat does with it |
|---|---|
| Practice — the wailing dance, the Kintsugi-Mu, lived and embodied | Doctrine — systematised, written, transmissible |
| The help economy — gift, not transaction | Political alliance — negotiation, leverage |
| The cloth — the old ways carried inside the new form | The uniform — the new form worn as identity |
| The fracture made stronger — Kintsugi | The fracture sealed — Grout |
| Restoration from within | Institution from above |

He becomes effective. He loses something that cannot be named in the doctrine because the doctrine is what replaced it.

Whether that loss is permanent, or whether the seed-planting itself is the moment he finds it again — plants the thing in the earth and for one moment is just a wombat with his hands in the soil, no doctrine, no alliances, no institution, just the motion — is the story's final question.
