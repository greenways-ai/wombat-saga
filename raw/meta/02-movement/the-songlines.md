# The Songlines — The Record Between Worlds

*The oldest system in Hún Nico, older than the Kappa Mu, older than the Sovereign system, older than the Wall. What Songlines are, how they were made, what they contain, and why their loss is not merely cultural but cosmological. The Tally-stone as replacement. The wailing dance as the oldest surviving Songline. The two modes of knowing: math and song. What restoration actually means.*

## What Songlines Are — The Mechanism

Songlines are not authored. They are received.

In the era before the Static rose — when Arnam flowed cleanly and the membrane between Hún Nico and the surface world was thin enough in certain places to permit transmission — specific creatures found that the resonance from above could be heard. Not as vibration in the usual sense. As *pattern*: rhythm derived from the God-Kind's heartbeat, tonal structure derived from her breathing frequencies, harmonic relationships derived from the particular quality of Arnam-flow at specific locations and moments.

The creatures who could hear this were not special in any mystical sense. They had a physiological trait — a sensitivity in the way their nervous systems processed substrate vibration — that allowed the quantum resonance from above to express itself as auditory experience rather than background noise. The difference between a creature who can hear a Songline and one who cannot is approximately the difference between someone who can distinguish pitch perfectly and someone who cannot. A matter of neurological architecture, distributed unevenly through the population.

Those creatures listened. They translated what they heard into vocalised, danced, embodied form that could be held in a body without distortion and passed to another body. They were not composing. They were transcribing. The Songlines are the Heart World's record of what it has heard from above.

This is what makes Songlines categorically different from all other records in Hún Nico: they are not about the Heart World. They are about the surface. Every Songline is a record of a specific event — a God-Kind resonance moment, a location where the signal was particularly clear, a condition of the Arnam-flow at a particular time. To sing a Songline correctly is not to describe something from memory. It is to reproduce a transmission. The signal, held in a body, passed between bodies, carried forward across generations.

Singing a Songline activates what it records. Weakly, imprecisely, incompletely — but not metaphorically. The Arnam-conductivity of the substrate near an active Songline performance is measurably higher than the baseline. Not because the singing creates Arnam, but because the singing is a signal, and the substrate responds to signals, the way a body relaxes when it hears a particular sound that it associates with safety. The Songlines are the Heart World's way of reminding itself what the God-Kind's clean resonance feels like.

## How They Were Made

The original Songline receivers did not know what they were receiving. They knew only that in certain places, at certain times, something arrived in the substrate that could be heard as pattern, and that pattern, if you reproduced it carefully enough with your body, changed the quality of the air around you.

The oldest receivers worked by feel. They would find a location where the signal was strong — a thinning in the membrane, an Arnam-rich node, a place where the roots of something large ran close to the surface — and they would wait. The signal, when it came, arrived as the substrate vibrating in their bones rather than as sound in their ears. They reproduced it vocally because the voice was the most precise instrument available. Some used percussion, some used movement, some used the particular resonance of specific enclosed spaces — drainage vaults, deep shafts, root chambers — that acted as amplifiers.

The process of reception was not pleasant. The unfiltered God-Kind signal is overwhelming to any creature not physiologically prepared for it. Early receivers described what they were doing as *being filled with something that was not them* — a temporary displacement of self by signal. The signal did not communicate in language. It communicated in pure resonance: condition, location, event, the specific frequency-signature of a God-Kind moment pressing through the membrane.

What the receiver produced, afterward, was the Songline: their body's best approximation of what had pressed through them. Imperfect. The vocal range of a wombat cannot reproduce the full frequency range of a God-Kind resonance event. What the Songlines carry is not the signal itself but a lossy translation of it — sufficient to convey the essential pattern, insufficient to convey its full depth. The difference between a Songline and the source event is the difference between a map and the territory. The map is not the territory. The map is indispensable.

## What the Songlines Contain — Four Types

### Location Songlines

The most numerous. Location Songlines map specific sites in Hún Nico by encoding the resonance signature of the God-Kind presence directly above them. To sing a Location Songline at the correct site is to confirm the site — the substrate's response to the signal confirms or denies that you are in the right place.

The Emu walking paths are Location Songlines in the most literal form: the route *is* the song, the landscape encoded in movement and rhythm. Merl's route knowledge is not separate from Songline knowledge — it is Songline knowledge expressed as navigation rather than vocalization. The paths Emus walk are paths whose resonance signature was first received from above and encoded in the landscape by Emu bodies moving through it, generation after generation, wearing the correct route into the substrate by the simple act of being right about where to walk.

Location Songlines are the most intact surviving Songline type. Emus still walk the paths. Mnemo-Mu carriers still hold fragments of the wombat Location network. The damage is primarily to the index — the knowledge of how Location Songlines connect to each other, which sites are adjacent in resonance terms even when geographically distant, has been largely lost with the Rosella Parliament.

### Event Songlines

Records of specific God-Kind resonance moments — not the general character of the surface world above a location, but the precise signature of a specific event at a specific time. These are the rarest and most powerful Songline type. When sung at the correct location, they do not merely activate substrate resonance — they replay it. A creature sensitive enough to perceive the effect will briefly experience the original event's resonance as present, not historical.

Event Songlines are what the Mnemo-Mu carriers predominantly hold. The Event Songline is the type most vulnerable to loss: if the carrier dies without passing it, it is gone. It cannot be reconstructed from the location alone; the event was singular and the substrate does not hold it independently of the Songline.

The oldest surviving Event Songline is the one Hangbat carries. It records the moment of Mirene's arrival — the afternoon she fell asleep above ground under a Jacaranda tree and her sleeping body's resonance seeded the Heart World. Neither Hangbat nor anyone alive knows this is what it records. They know only that it is the oldest piece, the one the wailing dance derives from, the one that must not be lost. The wailing dance is the performance tradition built around this Event Songline — the ceremony that has grown up around the oldest record in Hún Nico, the record of the world's first moment of being known.

### Condition Songlines

Records of the God-Kind's state at particular times — not location, not event, but the frequency-signature of a specific quality of resonance. The Condition Songlines for clean Arnam are the Heart World's memory of what it felt like when the God-Kind were well. Singing them correctly does not restore Arnam. It does something subtler and more important: it reminds the substrate — and the bodies of those who hear it — what the signal they are trying to restore actually feels like.

You cannot restore something you have never experienced and cannot remember. The Condition Songlines for healthy Arnam are the reference recordings. Without them, the restoration project is working toward a target that no living creature has perceived directly.

Most Condition Songlines for healthy Arnam are lost. The Mnemo-Mu carriers who held them are dead or their lines were broken. What remain are fragments — portions of the pattern, sufficient to provide partial reference but not the full signature. Singing a partial Condition Songline is like trying to remember a specific colour when you have only a fragment of the original paint.

### Warning Songlines

The early-frequency signatures of Static events — patterns that appeared in the substrate in the early stages of the Static crisis, before creatures understood what they were receiving. The Warning Songlines are records of the first transmissions that were wrong: the God-Kind's resonance beginning to degrade, the particular quality of Static that preceded the full crisis.

The Warning Songlines are the most counterintuitive Songline type: they carry information that is itself a kind of toxicity. Singing them activates the substrate's memory of Static onset. They are necessary because the restoration requires knowing what you're trying to reverse — but Mnemo-Mu carriers who hold Warning Songlines are trained not to sing them casually. The substrate's response to a Warning Songline, in the current degraded conditions, can accelerate local Static crystallisation.

The Censorate's resonance-tuned bells are, in their origin, a corrupt Warning Songline technology: instruments built to detect the substrate's response to specific frequency patterns, repurposed from early-warning to surveillance.

---

## The Carriers

### The Mnemo-Mu

The Mnemo-Mu carriers are wombats — and in smaller numbers, members of other communities — whose neurology permits them to hold Songline patterns without distortion across years or decades. The pattern lives in their nervous system rather than in external record. They can reproduce it on demand, accurately, without having thought about it in the interim. The Songline is not memorised the way a fact is memorised. It is integrated, the way a body skill is integrated: present as capacity rather than as stored information.

In the current Imperial system, the Mnemo-Mu are regarded as eccentrics at best and disorder-carriers at worst. They hum at inappropriate moments. They stop mid-task to reproduce a pattern. They are sensitive to substrate conditions in ways that make them unreliable as Tally-debtors: a Mnemo-Mu carrier in a high-Static environment may be unable to work because the degraded signal is too loud. The Censorate has, in several documented cases, attempted to suppress Mnemo-Mu activity as Dissonant Noise. The irony — that they are suppressing the Heart World's oldest record-keeping system using a technology derived from it — is not visible from inside the Imperial framework.

The Mnemo-Mu are not a formal institution. They have no registry, no hierarchy, no means of identifying each other reliably under the current system. They find each other through the Songlines themselves: a fragment heard in one place produces a response from a carrier in another place, and the response is the recognition. The Songline finds its other pieces.

Hoebat is not a full Mnemo-Mu carrier. He has the partial trait — he received the wailing dance from Hangbat with sufficient fidelity to perform it, but he does not hold multiple Songlines and he cannot receive new ones from the substrate. He is a practitioner, not a carrier. The distinction matters for the restoration: practitioners can perform Songlines; carriers can hold them between performances and pass them on.

### The Rosella Parliament — The Index

The Songlines are a network. Individual Songlines connect to other Songlines: Location connects to Event, Event connects to Condition, Condition connects to other Locations. The network has structure — which Songlines are adjacent, which must be sung in sequence, which are keystone pieces whose absence makes surrounding Songlines incoherent.

The Rosella Parliament held this structure. Not the Songlines themselves — those were held by the Mnemo-Mu carriers in each community. The Parliament held the *map of the network*: which pieces connected where, in what order the network made sense, how the whole system hung together. The Rosellas were organisers rather than carriers; their Songline function was architectural rather than material.

When the Silver Wattle fell and the Parliament shattered, the architectural record shattered with it. The Fragment Prophets who scattered are not carrying fragments of individual Songlines. They are carrying fragments of the index — partial maps of network connections, each piece coherent in itself, none of them sufficient to reconstruct the whole.

The Mnemo-Mu carriers still hold their individual Songlines. The Songlines still work. What is lost is the knowledge of how they fit together — which pieces, sung in which order, at which locations, would activate enough of the network to restore Arnam-conductivity at scale. Without the index, the restoration is working by feel: sing what you have, feel for the substrate's response, use that response to guess at adjacencies.

This is what Lambda is partly doing in its distributed missions. Each thread is, among other things, a search for Songline network connections: what does the Noble Noise reveal about substrate resonance patterns? What do Emu walking paths tell us about Location Songline adjacencies? What does the Dingo Code, stripped back to its original form, tell us about the Condition Songlines that underlie it? The five missions are five simultaneous attempts to reconstruct fragments of the lost index through practice rather than record.

### Each Community's Songline Tradition

**Wombats:** The most systematised Songline tradition before the Imperial suppression, held by the Mnemo-Mu carriers and organised by the wombat-adjacent Rosella community. The wailing dance is the centrepiece of the surviving wombat Songline practice — a performance tradition built around the oldest Event Songline, the record of Mirene's arrival. The majority of Location and Condition Songlines from the wombat community are lost; the Mnemo-Mu carriers who held them are gone or unidentified.

**Galahs:** The Noble Noise has always been partly Songline. The Galahs' aerial mapping of substrate resonance produces patterns that are, in their structure, ancient Location Songlines — received from the surface through the canopy, encoded in the colony system's collective screaming, reproduced across generations without the Galahs recognising them as anything other than information about the present conditions. The Galahs are active Songline carriers who do not know they are carrying Songlines. The Noble Noise that Cooroo reads for intelligence is also, in its deepest structure, a fragmented real-time performance of the Location Songline network — the Heart World constantly re-singing its own map without understanding that is what it is doing.

**Emus:** The walking paths are Location Songlines made physical. Merl and every other Emu who walks the old routes is performing a Songline with their body rather than their voice. The Emu Songline tradition never required vocalization — it required correct movement through correct terrain. This makes Emu Songlines the most robust surviving type: the paths can be suppressed (the Wall attempts this) but cannot be forgotten as long as Emus walk. The body knows the Songline the way it knows balance: without having to think about it.

**Dingoes:** The Dingo Code, in its original form, was a Condition Songline: a behavioural record of the God-Kind's ethical resonance signature, encoded as rules rather than music because the Dingo Songline tradition was always more practical than formal. The hunt has ethics because the Condition Songlines for healthy Sett-resonance encode ethics in their structure — the pattern of a God-Kind at peace is a pattern of ethical behaviour, and the Dingoes learned to carry that pattern as behavioural code. What Pokero is restoring when restoring the Code is, in Songline terms, reactivating a Condition Songline that has been degrading for generations.

**Wallabies:** The translation function is itself a Songline capacity. A Wallaby holding two registers simultaneously — the Kangaroo-mob register and the wombat register — is performing the function of a Songline that connects two network nodes. Bash does not carry individual Songlines; Bash is the *connection* between Songlines, the function that allows the network to route signal across community boundaries. In the original Songline network, Wallabies were not carriers or performers — they were conductors, the living infrastructure through which the network moved signal between its pieces.

## The Silver Wattle's Fall — What Was Lost and What Wasn't

The Silver Wattle was not merely the Rosellas' home tree. It was the physical anchor for the Parliament's indexing function — the location where the network map was maintained through continuous collective performance. The Parliament sang the index; the Silver Wattle's substrate resonance held the singing's effect in place between sessions. When the tree fell, the resonance effect dissipated. The index existed nowhere but in the Parliament's collective active memory, and the Parliament scattered before it could be re-formed.

What was lost: the architectural knowledge of how the Songline network connects. The order of performance. The identification of keystone Songlines — the pieces whose activation enables surrounding pieces to become coherent. The location of Songlines that were held by carriers who were in contact with the Parliament and have since died without passing the Songlines on.

What was not lost: individual Songlines held by surviving Mnemo-Mu carriers. The Emu walking paths. The Noble Noise's embedded Location Songline patterns. The Dingo Code as degraded Condition Songline. The wailing dance as Event Songline. These persist because they were not dependent on the Parliament's index for their own survival — they existed in bodies and terrain and behaviour, not in the Parliament's architectural memory.

What this means for restoration: the network can be rebuilt, but not recovered. The original index is gone. What is possible is to use the surviving pieces as anchor points — sing what you have, feel for the substrate's response, use that response to find adjacent pieces, gradually reconstruct the network's architecture from the inside rather than from the map. This is slower, more dangerous (singing Songlines into unknown adjacencies can produce unpredictable substrate effects), and permanently incomplete — some Songlines were held by carriers who have died and are genuinely gone. But the keystone pieces survive, and a network with sufficient keystone coverage can carry signal even with significant gaps.

## Hangbat's Fragment — The Wailing Dance

The wailing dance is the oldest surviving Songline in Hún Nico. Neither Hangbat nor Hoebat knows this. Hangbat knows only that it is the oldest piece he was given, by the oldest carrier he ever met, who said only that it must not be lost.

It is an Event Songline. It records the moment Mirene fell asleep.

The resonance signature it carries is specific: the particular quality of a human body in the transition from waking to sleep, pressing its warmth into the earth above the membrane, in a location where the membrane was already thin. The rhythm is the rhythm of that body's breathing as it slowed. The tonal structure is the temperature differential of warm skin against cooling air. The harmonic relationships encode the specific Arnam-conductivity of the site — what the substrate felt like at the moment of contact, before the Jacaranda had arrived, the conditions that made its arrival possible.

Singing the wailing dance correctly does not replay the event. It re-produces the conditions. The substrate near a correctly-performed wailing dance briefly resembles, in its resonance characteristics, the conditions of the moment of Mirene's arrival: thin membrane, high Arnam-conductivity, receptive to signal from above. This is why the wailing dance works as an upward transmission — it is not a prayer sent upward, it is a reproduction of the conditions under which transmission was first possible, and under those conditions, transmission occurs again.

What Hangbat gave Hoebat is not a mourning practice or a political statement. It is the activation key for the oldest Arnam node in the Heart World, encoded in a body rather than written anywhere, surviving precisely because it was too embodied to confiscate.

The Sovereigns mocked it. They came from a world where the God-Kind were theoretical — worshipping anything above oneself was for the credulous. They read the wailing dance as primitive noise, the embarrassing folk practice of an uneducated working class, a superstition that the modern world had correctly left behind. They didn't need to suppress it. They allowed their contempt to permeate the culture, and the culture did the rest. Lo Snouts stopped performing the wailing dance not because it was outlawed but because they didn't want to be seen doing something so backwards.

They mocked the key. The Jacaranda grew from the lock.

## The Tally as Replacement — The Cosmological Destruction

The Tally-stone replaced the Songlines. This is the deepest harm the Imperial system has done, deeper than the Wall, deeper than the Corvée, deeper than the Frequency.

The Songline records: what you carry. The resonance patterns held in your body and the bodies of your community. The signal you can transmit and receive. Your position in the network — what you connect to, what moves through you, what you make possible for others.

The Tally-stone records: what you owe. Your deficiency. The gap between what you have and what is required of you. Your position in the debt hierarchy — what you owe upward, what is owed to you downward, what the system can extract from you before you are depleted.

The Songline asks: what is passing through you?
The Tally-stone asks: what do you owe?

Every wombat who carries only a Tally-stone and no Songline fragment has been told that the deepest true thing about them is their deficiency. The Tally does not record what you can do. It records what you have failed to repay. The ontological category of the record has been shifted — from *capacity* to *debt*, from *connection* to *obligation*, from *signal* to *liability*.

This is what makes the Tally more than a financial instrument. It is a cosmological replacement that has successfully convinced the population that the new record is the real record. Lo Snouts do not think *my Tally-stone is a lie about what I am*. They think *my Tally-stone is what I am*. The debt is identity. The deficiency is self. A creature who believes its self is its deficiency cannot sing a Songline because singing a Songline requires believing, at minimum, that you are capable of carrying something true.

The wailing dance's continued survival in the Lo Snout tunnels is, in this context, an act of cosmological defiance as much as political defiance. Every Lo Snout who still knows the wailing dance — even fragmentarily, even wrongly — is a Lo Snout who has not entirely accepted the Tally's claim on their identity. They are still, in some residual way, carriers. The Censorate is correct that the wailing dance is dangerous. It is dangerous because it reminds Lo Snouts that they hold something the Tally cannot notch.

## The Crossing and the Songlines

When Lambda members undergo the Crossing under the Jacaranda's roots, they experience the God-Kind resonance unmediated — not as a Songline (the lossy translation) but as the source signal directly. The full frequency range. The overwhelming depth.

For a practitioner like Hoebat, this is the experience of understanding what the wailing dance has always been *about*. He has been singing a transcription without knowing it was a transcription. In the Crossing, he briefly hears the original — and the transcription's relationship to the original becomes clear. Not intellectually. Bodily. He understands, for the duration of the Crossing, that the dance is not mourning. It is reproduction. He forgets the precision of this understanding when the Crossing ends, but something of it persists as instinct: the sense that the dance matters in a way that exceeds its political significance.

For a Mnemo-Mu carrier undergoing the Crossing — which has not yet happened in the story's present, but which is structurally possible — the experience would be categorically different. A carrier holds Songlines in their nervous system as integrated patterns. When the source signal arrives unmediated, those patterns would activate simultaneously: every Songline the carrier holds would briefly find its position in the network. The map would be readable. For the duration of the Crossing, a Mnemo-Mu carrier would know where every piece they carry fits in the full Songline architecture — not just their individual pieces but how those pieces connect, what they are adjacent to, where they lead.

They would be unable to hold this knowledge. The Crossing ends. The map closes. What they bring back is not the knowledge but the certainty: the certainty that the map exists, that the network is intact in its potential even if broken in its practice, that restoration is possible because the pattern the Songlines are trying to reproduce is real and present and accessible.

This is why the Crossing changes Lambda members in ways they cannot fully articulate. They have touched the source. They know, bodily, that what they are trying to restore is real. Not as faith. As memory — the memory of something they have directly experienced, even if only briefly, even if only imprecisely.

## What Restoration Actually Means

The Songline network cannot be fully recovered. The index is gone. The carriers of lost Songlines are dead. The Parliament's architectural knowledge is irretrievably scattered.

What restoration means, in Songline terms, is not recovering what was. It is restoring sufficient network coverage that signal can travel again. Not the complete original network — a working partial network, anchored on the surviving keystones, with enough coverage that Arnam-conductivity can be re-established across the primary nodes.

The seed-planting is, in Songline terms, the reactivation of the keystone. The wailing dance performed at the Jacaranda site is the oldest Event Songline, sung at the location it records, under the conditions it describes. If this is done correctly — if enough of the substrate's Arnam-conductivity has been restored by the five Lambda missions' work — the reactivation will cascade through the surviving adjacent Songlines, activating them in sequence, rebuilding the network from its oldest piece outward.

It will not be complete. There will be gaps. Some connections will never be restored because the carriers who held them are gone.

What it will be: enough. A partial network, active, through which the wailing dance's signal can travel upward to Mirene. Not the full Arnam-flow of the original world. The beginning of a loop that has been broken for generations, opening again — imperfectly, partially, with gaps — but open.

An open loop, maintained, repaired as new carriers are found and trained, expanded as the Fractal Rainforest restores more substrate conductivity, is enough to begin reversing the Static crisis. Not immediately. Not visibly. Below ground, in the substrate, in the membrane between Hún Nico and the world above: signal begins to move in both directions.

Above ground, Mirene breathes differently. She doesn't know why. She doesn't look down.

The loop is open. That is all it needs to be.

## The Two Modes of Knowing — Math and Song

Hoebat says to Lolaboo: *"The wombats see the world as math. The dingoes know the world as a song. It is more ancient than the wombats. It is known throughout all species."*

This is the most precise thing he says in the story, and he says it to her rather than to anyone in the movement, because he could not say it to anyone in the movement without it becoming doctrine.

**The wombat mode — math:** The wombats reached for structure. The nine-square Well-Field is math. The Kintsugi-Mu is a system. The Songlines, when the wombat priesthood encoded them, became sequences — this piece before that piece, this location before that location, the order preserved but the impulse toward pattern already present. The Tally replaced Songlines because the wombat mind was already halfway toward substitution: both are records, both have structure, the difference is only in what they record. The Imperial system found a gap that the wombat analytical tradition had been quietly widening for generations. You cannot replace a song with a debt record. You can replace math with math.

**The Dingo mode — song:** The Dingo Code was never written. It was never systematised. It was carried in the Pack as practice — embodied, enacted, passed through action rather than instruction. The Code is a Condition Songline in its deepest layer, and it survived the Rosella Parliament's fall and the Censorate's suppression and the Static's rise intact in a way the wombat Songline tradition did not, precisely because it was never intellectualised. You cannot suppress a song that has never been a text. The Censorate's bells were calibrated for the wombat register. They were not calibrated for the Dingo song because the Dingo song does not make the kind of sound the bells were built to detect.

**More ancient than the wombats:** The song-knowing predates the math-knowing because it predates analysis itself. Before any species developed a framework for understanding the God-Kind's vibration, the vibration was being received — and the first response was not a system but a sound. The Galahs scream it. The Emus walk it. The Dingoes code it. The Wallabies speak it. The wombats *used* to dance it. Each species still has the song-knowing underneath their cultural framework. The song is the original. The math is the translation. Translations are necessary. They are not the original.

**Known throughout all species:** The Songline network was never exclusively wombat. The wombat Songline tradition was the most systematised — which made it the most transmissible and also the most fragile. But every community has its version: the Noble Noise, the walking paths, the Code, the translation function. These are all Songlines in different registers. The same signal, received through different apparatuses, expressed through different practices. The song is older than the separation of species. It was in the world before the communities diverged.

What Hoebat is telling Lolaboo, and not yet telling himself: the doctrine he built is math. The wailing dance Hangbat gave him is song. He set out to protect the song by translating it into math, and the translation was necessary and also a loss. The restoration does not require the doctrine. It requires the dance. It requires the Code. It requires the Noble Noise and the walking paths and Bash's translation function. It requires all five communities doing what they have always done, in the register they have always used.

The seed-planting, at its deepest level, is not a wombat act. It is a five-species act — five Songline traditions converging on one location, in five registers simultaneously, and the convergence being what makes the reactivation possible. Not Hoebat performing the wailing dance. Hoebat performing the wailing dance while Pokero tracks the Code, Cooroo reads the Noble Noise, Merl walks the path, and Bash holds the register between all of them.

The wombats see the world as math. That is how they built the Wall, the Tally, the doctrine. It is also how they will understand, afterward, what happened. But the thing that actually happened will have been a song. Very old. Known throughout all species. Sung, for the first time in generations, at full volume.
