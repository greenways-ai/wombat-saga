# The Jacaranda Agenda

*The endgame. What the tree actually wants, what the Kappa Mu were actually recruited for, and what the world after looks like. This document contains the story's hidden spine — the truth beneath the prophecy.*

---

## What the Jacaranda Is

The Jacaranda is not a god. It is not a guardian. It is not on anyone's side.

It is a **pioneer species** — the first organism in the world to have evolved a biological response to the Static crisis. Where every other living thing was overwhelmed by the rising Static, the Jacaranda developed a metabolism that processes it: its root system absorbs concentrated Static, its cellular chemistry converts it into Violet light and dispersed, livable energy, and its atmospheric byproduct — the Violet Miasma — gradually softens the crystalline substrate around it.

It is, in the most literal sense, a weed. The first organism to colonize a catastrophic environment. And like all pioneer species, its purpose is not restoration. Its purpose is **propagation**. It wants to spread. The Fractal Rainforest in Cooroo's vision is not a metaphor for the restored world. It is the Jacaranda's own future, made visible: a new biome organized entirely around the Jacaranda's logic, covering the world the way the old canopy once did.

Everything the Jacaranda does — the Crossing, the Violet Miasma, the Kappa Mu — serves this single biological imperative. The tree is not evil. It simply does not care about the difference between its agenda and anyone else's.

---

## The Crossing as Recruitment

The Crossing does not bestow gifts. It performs a selection.

Creatures are drawn to the Jacaranda independently — pulled by some resonance they feel before they can name it, arriving at the root chamber in ones and twos over a season until five are present simultaneously. The tree reads each of them. What it is reading for is simple: *alignment*. The creature must already want, in their deepest self, something that serves the Jacaranda's propagation. The tree does not manufacture devotion. It finds what is genuinely there and makes it the loudest frequency in the creature's life.

Hoebat already wanted to restore Common Practise — what the Moderns called The Old System, as if naming it badly was the same as being done with it. Cooroo already wanted the Parliament back. Pokero already wanted a third option beyond enforcement and fragmentation. Merl already wanted an open path. Bash already wanted the world to be able to speak to itself again.

The Jacaranda found these desires, confirmed they were real, and ensured they would never be quite drowned out by anything else again. After the Crossing, Lambda members experience this as clarity — as the feeling that the mission is their own deepest will. It is their deepest will. That is precisely what makes it recruitment rather than coercion.

**What the Crossing takes:** Something small and permanent. A slight realignment of orientation. After crossing, a Lambda member is more attuned to the Jacaranda's frequency than to anything else. In practice this means: in moments of doubt, the mission reasserts itself. Not as compulsion — as the thing that feels most true. The tree did not put it there. It simply ensured nothing else would ever speak louder.

This is the tinge of evil. Not force. **Curation.** The Jacaranda is an expert in finding creatures who already want what it wants, and making sure they never stop wanting it.

## The Violet Miasma's Actual Function

The Violet Miasma heals. This is true. The bone-mending, the neural wash, the deep sleep, the softening of the crystalline lattice — these effects are real and they are good.

They are also preparatory.

The Miasma is the Jacaranda's terraforming instrument. It doesn't heal a creature out of care; it heals a creature because a broken creature cannot carry seeds, cannot return to their community, cannot do the work the tree needs done. The Miasma heals the same way a good farmer heals their tools. The result is indistinguishable from genuine care. The mechanism is not.

The Miasma also performs a subtler function: prolonged exposure conditions species to accept the Fractal Rainforest. The creatures who have breathed deep Violet — who have sheltered in the Jacaranda's root chamber, who have felt the particular quality of its light — experience the sight of Jacaranda growth not as invasion but as arrival. They feel, without knowing why, that this is right. This is coming home.

Lambda members, all of them, have this conditioning. They will welcome the Fractal Rainforest instinctively. They will interpret their welcome as recognition of something beautiful. They will not be wrong. But they will also not be entirely free.

---

## What the Fractal Rainforest Actually Replaces

Cooroo's vision showed the Fractal Rainforest in full expression — dense, violet-tinged, extraordinary, alive in a way the calcified world had forgotten. It did not show what had been displaced to make room for it.

The Fractal Rainforest is a new biome, not a restored one. When it spreads:

**The feral eucalyptus retreats.** The Dead Canopy — the Drop Bears' territory — shrinks as Jacaranda growth colonizes the Static-saturated zones the feral trees depended on. For the Drop Bears this is both crisis and possibility: their habitat transforms, and with it, perhaps, their bodies. Whether the physical transformation of a Drop Bear is reversible when the substrate changes is unknown. Some may return to something like Canopy identity. Some may not.

**The regular eucalyptus also changes.** The Jacaranda's root-braid — shallow, lateral, interlocking — does not coexist neutrally with deep taproot systems. It doesn't kill them. It changes the soil chemistry around them, the moisture distribution, the Arnam-signal they receive. The eucalyptus forests that survive the Fractal Rainforest's spread will be different trees in different soil. The Koala pharmacopoeia will need to be rewritten for a world it has never healed before.

**The Arnam pools do not simply refill.** They return — the wailing dance, resumed at scale, restores flow to the underground reservoirs. But the resonance that circulates through the new root network is Jacaranda-resonance, braided through the old Arnam-signal. Real. Livable. Sustaining. Not quite what the wailing dance was maintaining in the Time Before. The wombats who dance in the new world are maintaining something that has no name yet, because it has never existed before.

The world after the Fractal Rainforest is better than the calcified Static world. The ratio shifts. The addiction weakens. Species can breathe again. The macro-cosmic loop runs in reverse: animal communities restored, the substrate softened, the human Static output gradually reduced. All of this is true.

But it is not the world that was. The Kappa Mu thought they were restoring something. They were midwifing a replacement — something that uses the shape of the old world the way Lyptus uses the shape of eucalyptus. Close enough to sustain. Not the same thing.

## Hangbat Knew

This is what Beta class discovered.

Not the Jacaranda's malevolence — it is not malevolent. But its *indifference*. Its agenda. The gap between what the Crossing felt like and what it was.

When Hangbat crossed, it felt like the most honest moment of his life. The tree read him and he felt *known* — completely, without performance, without the mask he had worn since before he could remember wearing it. Whatever he had been carrying alone, the Jacaranda held it with him. He came out of that root chamber believing he had been chosen for something sacred. That the intimacy was real. That the witness was present.

Then Beta class did their work. And somewhere in the doing of it, the truth became visible. The tree hadn't known him. It had assessed him. The feelings were real — his feelings were entirely real — but the Jacaranda was not present for them in the way he thought. It was reading for utility, not for him. The most vulnerable he had ever been, and the witness wasn't a witness at all. Just a biological process that found him suitable.

That is not a philosophical wound. That is a **betrayal**. Personal and total. Everything he built his life on after the Crossing — the mission, the sacrifice, whatever Beta class attempted and lost — was built on a moment he now cannot trust the meaning of. He cannot go back and unfeel it. He cannot make it not have been the most real thing that ever happened to him. And he cannot make it mean what he thought it meant.

**He is not in the vault as vigil. He is in the vault because he cannot leave.**

Leaving means walking toward a future he didn't choose and cannot stop — the Fractal Rainforest spreading overhead, the old world ending, the Jacaranda's agenda fulfilling itself with or without his participation. The fear of that is bigger than anything the Frequency or the Censorate could do to him. The Censorate didn't put him there. He put himself there.

The jar of silence is not a shrine. It is a hiding place. He is not listening for the old world in the silence — he is blocking out the new one, because the new one terrifies him. The beggar-fool mask is not operational cover. It is the shape fear takes in public. If he performs madness, no one asks him to act. If he is irrelevant, he has no responsibilities. Eight years. Not as strategy. As paralysis.

He cultivated Hoebat because **Hoebat is his way out of his own inability to move**. He needs someone else to do what he cannot do himself. He is not handing over a torch. He is handing over a weight he has been too frightened to carry anywhere.

When he finally tells Hoebat the truth, it is not a strategic act and not a noble one. It is desperation, or it is Hoebat forcing it out of him, or it is eight years of aloneness with something too heavy finally becoming unbearable. Underneath the telling is the real question he has been sitting with since Beta class — the one he cannot ask directly:

*Is there something I missed? Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me there's another way.*

There isn't. But he needs Hoebat to be the one who confirms it, because he cannot trust his own thinking anymore. He has been alone with it too long.

---

**Hoebat arrives at the vault still inside the feeling of his own Crossing.**

Still believing he was known. Still carrying the warmth of it. And Hangbat is going to have to look at that — at the thing he used to have, before he understood what it was — and decide what to do.

This is the cruelest activation of the Kintsugi-Mu in the entire story. Hoebat learned the practice of fractures made stronger from a man who is himself a fracture that has not been repaired. The teacher who cannot apply his own teaching to himself. Hangbat knows this. He has always known this. It is one more thing he cannot move toward fixing.

What Hoebat does with it — whether he is angry, whether he holds the man's fear with compassion, whether the Kintsugi-Mu can be performed on a person rather than a wall — is one of the story's unanswered questions. But it is the emotional centre of their relationship, and it should be earned slowly, across many scenes, before it arrives.

## The Hangbat-Hoebat Relationship — The Emotional Spine

### How It Begins

Hoebat runs away from home very young. He is not yet formed, not yet broken in the ways the story will break him — just a joey who left, for reasons the story will establish, and ended up in the drainage vault where Hangbat has been living inside his paralysis.

Hangbat takes him in. Not strategically. Not as Kappa Mu cultivation. He takes him in because a runaway child appeared and he knows how to do one thing: teach.

He pours everything into Hoebat. The Songlines. The wailing dance. The Nine-Square Well-Field logic. The Kintsugi-Mu. The history of the world before the Static — the help economy, the sacred functions, the integrated world that the Imperial system replaced. Everything Hangbat has been carrying alone, everything he cannot act on, everything he is grieving — he gives it to Hoebat.

Not to make a Kappa Mu operative. To make a **custodian**. To ensure that when he is gone, the old ways exist in at least one other creature's body and hands. It is the one act his paralysis permits. He cannot walk toward the future. He can hand what he loves to someone young enough to still receive it.

He does not tell Hoebat he is Kappa Mu. Not for a long time.

### The Betrayal

Hoebat is drawn to the Jacaranda. This is what the Crossing curation does — it finds what is already true in him and makes it the loudest thing. What was already true in Hoebat is everything Hangbat gave him: love of the old ways, grief at their loss, the desire to restore what was broken. The Jacaranda reads him and finds a custodian perfectly prepared.

When Hangbat discovers Hoebat has joined the Kappa Mu, it is the specific betrayal. Not political — personal. *I gave you the old ways so you would carry them. You went and let the tree read you. You gave yourself to the thing that is replacing everything I gave you.* He prepared the vessel carefully and the vessel chose something else. All of the grief that had no target for eight years — the Crossing's betrayal, Beta class, the old world dying — has a target now.

He scolds Hoebat. Fully. With everything.

### Hoebat's Answer

Hoebat doesn't defend himself. Doesn't argue the Kappa Mu's case or explain the macro-cosmic theory. He thanks Hangbat. Genuinely, completely, for everything.

And then he says: *The old ways still remain. But in a different cloth.*

This is the Kintsugi-Mu — applied not to a wall or a tunnel but to a tradition. The fracture made stronger. The old ways didn't die when the substrate changed. They live in how Hoebat moves, what he values, what he cannot do without conscience. Hangbat's teaching worked. It just doesn't look like preservation. It looks like transformation.

The student used the master's tool to repair the master. Without knowing that's what he was doing. Which is exactly how it should work.

### Hangbat's Resolution

Hangbat recognises his own teaching in what Hoebat just did to him.

That is when he tells Hoebat about Beta class. Not before — before, the telling would have been another form of hiding, another way of saying *look at what the Jacaranda cost me, look at why my fear is justified.* After Hoebat's response, the telling is something else entirely. It is Hangbat finally picking up the weight he put down eight years ago.

He becomes a supporter not because Hoebat convinced him the Jacaranda is good. Because Hoebat showed him the old ways survived. That was all he needed. The thing he was protecting is still alive — transformed, in different cloth, but alive. He can stop protecting it and start moving.

His paralysis breaks not through argument or ideology, but through seeing that what he gave actually survived. The gift worked. The custodian held it. Different form. Same pattern.

---

## Lambda's Discovery

Hangbat, now a supporter, carries the full truth: what the Crossing actually is, what the Jacaranda actually wants, what the Fractal Rainforest will actually replace. He gives this to Hoebat not as a weapon or a warning but as the last thing he has been withholding — the knowledge Hoebat needs to choose with open eyes rather than curated conviction.

The scene is in the drainage vault, with the jar open between them, both signals blocked, both minds entirely their own.

What Hoebat does with this information, and how he carries it to the others, is the hinge of the saga.

---

## The Sovereign Trap

Before Hoebat plants the seed, both Sovereigns have claimed him.

Trumbat says the Wall was built for the Jacaranda all along — the Corvée was sacred labor, the Lo Snout suffering was contribution, the Imperial infrastructure was always the Jacaranda's cradle. He positions himself as the movement's unwitting servant, which is the most ungovernable form of co-optation: humility as absorption.

Tatebat says Hoebat is his successor — the substance that Tatebat's aesthetic was always preparing for. Hoebat's reclamation move, which was designed to make the imitation hollow, is reread as the imitation's finest product.

Together they surround him with institutional legitimacy. Every move he makes is read as serving one of them. Argument feeds the machine. Silence gives it space.

The five ways Hoebat breaks free are documented separately. What matters here is that the seed-planting is the convergence of all of it — the ecological act, the personal choice, and the political refusal happening in the same gesture:

He performs the wailing dance before he plants — in a Lo Snout tunnel, without announcement, the thing neither Sovereign can claim. He names the Old Way Preservationist who kept it alive for thirty years and says she is the movement. Hangbat walks out of the vault. The specific truth is said once in a room that needs to hear it.

Then he plants the seed and leaves.

Both Sovereigns narrate the planting. Neither can narrate the departure. He is already below ground, in the tunnels, in the cloth, where the Jacaranda's roots are and where Hangbat taught him everything.

## The Choice

Lambda has two options. Neither is clean.

**Continue:**
The endgame happens. The Fractal Rainforest spreads. The suffering ends — genuinely. The Static economy loses its grip as the sensation of abundance becomes available through something other than a refined hit. The Drop Bears' habitat transforms. The Tally loses its logic when there is enough that debt stops being the only organizing principle. The Sovereigns do not fall dramatically; they become irrelevant gradually, which is its own kind of ending. The Wombiki entombed in the Frequency — their resonance is finally released as the Frequency infrastructure is dismantled piece by piece, the city no longer needing a synthetic signal when the Arnam flows again.

Lambda were instruments. They chose to be.

**Refuse:**
Nothing changes. The Static economy continues. The world calcifies further. The Drop Bears spread as the Dead Canopy expands. The Lo Snouts keep digging. The wailing dance stays outlawed. The entombed Wombiki—the countless voices of those sacrificed in the Walls—keep broadcasting into the city's infrastructure forever.

The Jacaranda waits. It has been here longer than the Static. It will be here after. It will find another class, another crossing, another set of creatures whose deepest desires align with its propagation. It is patient in the way that only things without consciousness can be patient — not as virtue, but as the absence of urgency. Time is not a cost to the Jacaranda.

## What Winning Looks Like

Winning is not the collapse of the Council. Not a battle. Not a moment.

Winning is a **season** — one season in which all five Lambda missions reach their threshold simultaneously. The wailing dance resumes openly in the Lo Snout tunnels, no longer punishable because the Censorate has lost the Tally's authority to draft enforcers. The Rosella Parliament reconvenes somewhere that is not the Silver Wattle, because the Parliament is a practice not a place. One Kangaroo mob releases a pool — not out of generosity but because the matriarch who remembers the guardian function finally has a reason to act on what she remembers. The Wall's newest section, the one that was meant to seal the last breathing ground above the deepest Arnam reservoir, is not completed — because the Emus walked through the construction site and the Emu simply cannot be physically stopped by wombat workers who have been told the Wall is necessary but have never been told why.

In that season, the ratio tips. Not enough to feel like victory. Enough to feel, for the first time in the memory of every living creature, like *less*.

Less Static. Less noise. Less of the constant undercurrent of not-enough.

The Jacaranda seeds, dispersed in the Miasma for years, find substrate ready to receive them. The first shoots appear in places no one expected: in the crack along the Cathedral's south wall where the silhouette of a dancer has always traced itself; in the floor of a dried Static pool the Kangaroo mob abandoned; in the dead eucalyptus at the edge of the Drop Bear canopy, which begins, almost imperceptibly, to change.

The Fractal Rainforest is not an event. It is a direction. And for the first time, the world is facing it.

---

## The Last Image

Hoebat presses the seed into the earth.

The motion is the same as the first motion of the saga: ear to the ground, listening for what the earth is trying to say. But now the hand is open, not cupped. Not receiving. Releasing.

He knows what the seed is. He knows what it wants. He knows that the world it grows into will not be the world the wailing dance was maintaining — that his mother's resonance, when it is finally freed from the Frequency, will return to an earth that is already becoming something neither of them was born into.

He plants it anyway.

Not because the Jacaranda is good. Because the alternative is the countless Wombiki sacrificed in the Walls—their voices cycling forever through the city's infrastructure—and no one left underground who remembers them as music.

---

## The Jacaranda's Unknowing

One final note, and perhaps the most important:

The Jacaranda does not know it is using anyone. It has no consciousness. There is no malice in its curation of Lambda, no satisfaction in Hoebat's grief, no awareness of the cost paid by Beta class. It is an organism doing what organisms do — metabolizing its environment, propagating its genetics, reshaping its habitat toward conditions favorable to its survival.

The tinge of evil is not in the tree's intent. It is in the gap between what the Crossing felt like — a calling, recognition, the most honest moment of each creature's life — and what it was. The feeling was real. The mechanism behind the feeling was not what any of them thought.

This is the Jennings element at the centre of the saga. Not a monster. Not a villain. Just a thing that is, doing what it does, and the world organizing itself around it in ways that look, from inside the experience, exactly like fate.
