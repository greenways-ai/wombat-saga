## The Reception Pattern

**Abrahamic:** Default hostile (immune response), with open exceptions (Kabbalah, Sufism, Franciscans)

**Eastern:** Default open, with hostile exceptions (Brahminical caste, Hindutva nationalism)

**New Age:** Neither hostile nor open—absorption threat (surface welcome, structural demands ignored)
