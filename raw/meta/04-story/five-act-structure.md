# The Wombat Saga — Five Act Structure

*The full narrative arc from the broken world to the bloom. Each act carries both the macro story (five species, the Sovereign system, the Jacaranda's agenda) and the personal story (Hoebat's arc as primary spine). Lambda members' parallel arcs are noted within each act.*

---

## ACT ONE: THE BROKEN WORLD
*"What has been lost, and who is left to remember it."*

**Dramatic question:** Who are these creatures, and what world has been broken around them?

**Time:** Before the Crossing. The origin arcs.

---

### The World Established

The Static economy in full operation. The Sovereign system at apparent stability — the Tally notching, the Frequency humming in the walls, the Wall rising section by section on Lo Snout backs, the Grout production cycle turning. The five communities each in their corruption: wombats buried in debt, Kangaroos hoarding pools, Koalas split between Canopy chemistry and Drop Bear feral, Dingoes hired as enforcement, Emus walking against a Wall that didn't exist a generation ago, Galahs screaming into an absence where the Parliament used to be, Wallabies carrying messages for an infrastructure that has no use for what they actually are.

The world is not in crisis. It is in stasis. The Static economy functions. The suffering is manageable, which is the most dangerous kind.

### Hoebat's Arc

A young wombat runs away from home — from a world of compliance, of Tally-Debt accepted as natural, of his father's silence in the face of what silence costs. He is not yet formed. He is just gone.

He finds the drainage vault. He finds Hangbat.

What follows is the longest sustained act of love in the story: Hangbat pouring everything he carries — the Songlines, the wailing dance, the Nine-Square Well-Field logic, the Kintsugi-Mu, the history of the integrated world before the Static — into a runaway joey who has the capacity to receive it. Not for the mission. Because the old ways need to live in at least one other body before Hangbat is gone. Not strategy. Grief doing the only thing grief can do.

Hoebat grows. He goes to the Academy. He builds something. He loses it — betrayal by Barnabat, complicity by Cornelibat, the particular silence of those who know better and choose otherwise. He fractures. He becomes a Ghost-Digger, then a Sump-Dweller, then nothing much.

And then something pulls him toward the surface. Toward a particular tree.

### The Parallel Origins

Each Lambda member in their broken world:

- **Cooroo** — the Silver Wattle falls, her mother goes into grief-trance, the Noble Noise continues without shape. She flies toward a sound she cannot name and finds a tree she was not looking for.
- **Pokero** — the Pack's contract with the Council is turning Dingoes into something the Code cannot recognise. He sees the lie with Obsidian clarity. He cannot unsee it. The tree finds him at the margin where the Pack's territory meets the place where no territory applies.
- **Merl** — the Wall has severed a route his body has known for its entire life. The disruption is not political — it is ontological. He walks toward the disruption, because an Emu can only walk toward what blocks him, and finds the tree in the gap the Wall hasn't reached yet.
- **Bash** — a Wallaby who tried to translate between two parties that did not want to be translated and was refused, watched the conflict happen anyway, and understood for the first time what it means to have a function that the world has decided not to use. The tree finds a creature whose gift has been made purposeless.

### The Crossing

Five creatures who arrived separately, drawn by the same pull, standing under the same roots for the first time.

The tree reads each of them. It finds what is already true — the love of the old ways in Hoebat, the need for the Parliament in Cooroo, the commitment to the Code in Pokero, the necessity of the open path in Merl, the orientation toward the between in Bash — and makes it the loudest thing. Not coercion. Curation. The deepest version of what they already are, amplified past the point of suppression.

They feel known. They are assessed. The difference between these two things will not become visible for a long time.

Lambda is formed. Five creatures return to their home communities, changed in ways they cannot yet name, carrying a mission whose full shape they cannot yet see.

**Act One ends:** Lambda has crossed. The world does not know this yet. The Jacaranda has found its vectors. The clock begins.

---

## ACT TWO: THE ROOTS TAKE HOLD
*"The movement before it knows it is a movement."*

**Dramatic question:** Can the threads survive their own growth?

**Time:** The early missions. The underground years.

---

### The World in Motion

The iconography begins to appear. Root-braid marks in Lo Snout tunnels. The Kintsugi line — banned repair, performed visibly — in places the Censorate has not yet thought to look. The Violet Miasma's footprint spreading slightly further each season. Rumours that nobody can source: a family's cracked wall healed overnight, a Censorate officer who confiscated a stone with a mark on it nobody could identify, a wombat in Bronxborow who smelled like something other than Grout.

The Sovereigns notice that something is happening. They do not yet know what.

### Hoebat's Arc

Hoebat is back in Melborow — threading, as the slang will eventually have it. Not yet as a public figure. As a Ghost-Digger doing the work of restoring what the Grout has damaged, one tunnel junction at a time, one family at a time. The Kintsugi-Mu applied not as doctrine but as practice, in the dark, without an audience.

He encounters the movement's edges — laterals he didn't know existed, Root-braid marks he didn't leave. The Kappa Mu is already bigger than Lambda. Earlier classes are active. He is running on infrastructure he cannot see, built by creatures he will never meet.

He returns to Hangbat. Not for the first time since the Crossing, but for the conversation that the Crossing has made necessary: he needs to understand what he is carrying. Hangbat teaches him more. The relationship deepens. Hangbat does not yet tell him about Beta class.

### The Parallel Missions — Early Phase

- **Cooroo** — among the Galah colonies, the Noble Noise network is being slowly shaped from within. Not reconstructed as Parliament — that is beyond her alone. But given direction, form, the sense that the screaming can carry meaning if it has something to mean. She is looking for Fragment Prophets who carry individual Rosella notes. She is the one Galah who knows what the full song sounds like.
- **Pokero** — inside the Pack, restoring the Dingo Code one individual at a time. The Code that was being used to hunt truth is being turned back toward its original purpose: discernment in service of the community. Slowly. Without announcement.
- **Merl** — walking the paths the Wall disrupted, mapping the gaps, teaching other Emus that the disruption can be read. A fence is a syntax error. Syntax errors can be worked around if you understand the grammar well enough.
- **Bash** — translating. Quietly reactivating the function that the world has been collapsing into relay. Two parties who cannot speak to each other directly, with a Wallaby in between, for the first time in a generation.

### The Movement Grows

The Root Keepers are encountered — creatures who stayed at the Jacaranda, who tend the roots, who view the Kappa Mu's portable mission with deep suspicion. *You took the Crossing and made it a method.* The Violet Seekers are encountered — creatures who went deep into the Miasma and did not come back to ordinary function. The movement has sects Hoebat didn't create and can't control.

Tatebat notices the Violet aesthetic has a frequency among Lo Snouts that carries cultural weight. He begins adopting it — root-braid in Cathedral stonework, Violet as a fashion colour, the slang of the underground circulating in upper burrow dinner conversation. *Down-deep* loses its precision. *In the braid* becomes a social signal. The co-optation begins, slow and beautiful and devastating.

**Act Two crisis:** The Sovereigns identify the Kappa Mu as five-species. This is the moment the problem changes category. A wombat underground movement is manageable. This is something else. The Censorate begins targeted operations. For the first time, Lambda members face direct individual threat. Someone close to the movement is taken — not a Lambda member, but someone who sheltered one. The cost becomes real and specific and has a name.

**Act Two ends:** The roots are in the ground. The movement is alive and growing and leaking. The Sovereigns know something exists without knowing its shape. The protection network is beginning to function but has not been tested. And Tatebat has the aesthetic, which means the clock on going public has accelerated — the genuine article must surface before the imitation becomes definitive.

---

## ACT THREE: SURFACING
*"The movement meets the light — and the light is complicated."*

**Dramatic question:** What is the movement actually working toward, and can Hoebat live with the answer?

**Time:** Going public. The Sovereign trap. The crisis of truth.

---

### The World Shifting

The going-public moment arrives not as a single decision but as a threshold crossed by accumulation. The iconography is too widespread to suppress. The rumours have too much specific detail. The Fractal Prophets are preaching openly in Lo Snout tunnels, and desperate wombats are listening, and the Censorate is too visibly present too often for the presence to mean nothing.

The Kappa Mu surfaces. Not everywhere simultaneously — in one Borow first, then another, then five. The symbols come off the walls and onto bodies. The name is said aloud in a market. Lambda members stop being anonymous.

### Hoebat's Reclamation Move

Tatebat's co-optation has spread the aesthetic everywhere. The surface purple is in every High Nose burrow. The genuine article risks being indistinguishable from the imitation.

Hoebat's response: he dresses as Tatebat. Speaks Tatebat's register. Uses the co-opted slang with full precision — *down-deep* meaning exactly what it originally meant, *in the braid* meaning braided, *the purple* meaning the Standing One. He looks like a Queensborow trend. Inside the fashionable form, exact truth.

The effect is specific. The audience is comfortable and then, without warning, the words start meaning something. Something specific. Something that costs something to hear. He is doing to the co-opted movement what the Jacaranda does to individual creatures — finding what is genuinely there underneath the performance and making it step forward.

Tatebat cannot call him out. They are saying the same things in the same register. To distinguish Hoebat as counterfeit, Tatebat must admit the original was always hollow. He cannot. He watches the room respond differently to Hoebat and has no instrument for stopping it.

The reclamation is working. And it is also working on Tatebat.

### Going Public Means Coming Under Attack

The ridicule arrives first. Strange. Weird. Five-species cultists who believe a tree is going to save them. The particular cruelty reserved for those who believe something passionately in public that the world finds absurd. Hoebat was not trained for being laughed at for the thing he holds most sacred.

Then the Council finds its footing. The Censorate has been collecting rubbings of iconography for months. Now there is a public face, a doctrine being built, a name that can be said aloud. The suppression becomes targeted.

Hoebat reaches for power. Alliances with High Noses who have their own reasons for supporting the movement. The Tally's logic used to protect Kappa Mu members from Corvée drafts. Strategic relationships with Dingo Pack leadership. The movement stops being a gift and starts being a negotiation.

It works. The attacks soften. The mission advances. And it is the precise antithesis of everything Hangbat gave him.

### The Sovereign Trap

Trumbat's claim: the Wall was built for the Jacaranda all along. The Corvée was sacred labor. The Lo Snout suffering was contribution. Trumbat is the movement's unwitting servant — which is the most ungovernable form of co-optation: humility as absorption.

Tatebat's claim: Hoebat is his successor. The aesthetic was always the form waiting for the substance. Together they complete what Tatebat began.

Hoebat is surrounded. The Lo Snouts who came to him because he was NOT the Sovereigns look at the picture and see a wombat flanked by Sovereigns. The Active Opposition makes its most devastating argument: *Your conversion looks identical to any other conversion. The tree read you. The Frequency reads everyone. How is your certainty different from theirs?*

He cannot fully answer. It is not entirely wrong.

### The Crisis of Truth — Hangbat Tells Him

In the drainage vault. The jar open between them. Both signals blocked. Both minds entirely their own.

Hangbat tells him about the Crossing. What it actually is. The assessment rather than the recognition. The biological pioneer species rather than the conscious guide. The Fractal Rainforest that will not restore the old world but replace it. What Beta class discovered. What it cost.

And then the scolding. *I gave you the old ways so you would carry them. You went and let the tree read you. You gave yourself to the thing that is replacing everything I gave you.*

Hoebat does not defend himself. He thanks Hangbat. For everything. And says:

*The old ways still remain. But in a different cloth.*

The student uses the master's own tool to repair the master. Hangbat recognises his teaching in what Hoebat just did to him. His paralysis — eight years of it — breaks. Not through argument. Through seeing that what he gave survived. The gift worked. The custodian held it. Different form. Same pattern.

Hangbat becomes a supporter. And he tells Hoebat everything he has been withholding.

**Act Three ends:** Hoebat knows the full truth. He must choose whether to continue. Lambda knows the Jacaranda's agenda. The Sovereign trap is in place. The movement is public but surrounded. Hangbat is out of the vault. And the choice — plant the seed knowing what the seed is, or refuse — is now fully visible to Hoebat in its complete form. He does not make it yet.

---

## ACT FOUR: THE COST
*"What it takes to be right."*

**Dramatic question:** What does the movement cost, and who pays?

**Time:** Maximum pressure. The reckoning before the resolution.

---

### The World Under Strain

The Sovereigns, having failed to suppress the movement by force and failed to absorb it through co-optation, move to what they have always had: the instruments of grinding economic and social pressure. Not dramatic suppression — sustained attrition. The Corvée draft increases in Lo Snout communities that have shown sympathy. The Frequency is tightened in specific tunnel sections until manageable fight-or-flight tips toward something that looks like madness. The Tally-Stone of anyone known to have sheltered a Kappa Mu member is notched deeper. Not arrests. Exhaustion. The system making ordinary life slightly more impossible, incrementally, without announcement.

Real losses accumulate. Not martyrs — the Sovereigns are too sophisticated for martyrdom, which gives movements their saints. Just families whose Tally-Debt is now impossible. Just children who will grow up in the Corvée. Just the specific weight of having supported something and paid for it without choosing to be a symbol.

### The Five-Species Network — Under Pressure

Each thread of the protection network is tested at its weakest point simultaneously:

- **Cooroo's Noble Noise mapping** is disrupted in the Central Borow region — a deliberate operation to confuse the aerial signal, to introduce false movement patterns. For a period, the early warning fails. The movement is briefly blind in a critical area.
- **Pokero's Pack position** is threatened — the Council offers the Pack leadership a contract improvement contingent on specific results. The internal Dingo politics become acute. The Code restoration Pokero has been building is tested against immediate Pack self-interest.
- **Merl's egress routes** — the Wall is completed in one critical section that closes a primary egress path. Lambda has to reroute. The rerouting costs time that one operation does not have.
- **Bash's translation relay** — interrupted for a period when a key wallaby node is taken. The coordination breaks down. Lambda members are briefly isolated from each other. Each one has to operate alone in the gap.
- **The Kangaroo shift** — becomes visible. The Sovereigns apply pressure on the mob leadership to reverse the matriarch's quietly held position. Whether she holds or reverses is one of the act's critical questions.

None of these failures are fatal to the network. Together they demonstrate that the network is real, functional, and being actively targeted — which means the Sovereigns now understand more of its shape than they did.

### Hoebat's Reckoning

He sees what the power move has cost. The doctrine he built has calcified in ways he didn't plan — the Old Cloth is treating it as law rather than orientation, demanding purity tests for the cloth he said was in everyone. The reclamation move has left him associated with Tatebat in ways he can't entirely disentangle. The movement that was supposed to be fractal and distributed has a center — him — because doctrine creates center.

He is doing Kintsugi on the world and Grout on himself.

Hangbat, who is now out of the vault and visible, watches this. What he says or doesn't say is the final expression of their relationship. He taught Hoebat the practice, not the doctrine. He watches the doctrine doing what doctrine does to practice. He knows Hoebat can see it. He does not tell him what to do. This is, in its way, the completion of the teaching — the student must find the application himself.

### The Active Opposition's Strongest Case

A former crosser — from an earlier class, possibly Gamma or Delta, unnamed in the public record — makes the case against the Jacaranda in a room full of people who have reason to listen. Specific. Without inflammatory language. Point by point.

The old world cannot be restored. The Jacaranda knows this and is using the movement's love of the old world as fuel for its own propagation. The Fractal Rainforest is not restoration. The Lo Snouts who are suffering for this movement are suffering for a tree's biological imperative, dressed as their liberation. Their pain is not sacred to the Council. It is not sacred to the Jacaranda either. It is simply cost.

Hoebat is in the room. He cannot fully refute it. He says the one thing he can say that is both true and insufficient: *I know. I plant the seed anyway. Not because the tree is good. Because the alternative is the world continuing to calcify, and I have seen what that costs, and I cannot choose it.*

The room is not fully convinced. Neither is he. He says it anyway. This is the difference between certainty and choice — and it is the most honest thing the doctrine cannot capture.

### The Wailing Dance

Hoebat performs the wailing dance. In a Lo Snout tunnel. Without announcement. The actual practice — the thing Hangbat taught him in the vault, the thing the Sovereign system mocked as primitive superstition, the thing that requires thirty years of teaching and the specific grief of a creature who loves the old world.

Not as statement. As the thing itself.

The Censorate arrives afterward — the Noble Noise network was disrupted, the warning came late. They find a tunnel of Lo Snouts and no Hoebat. What they find instead: Lo Snouts who watched something happen and now carry it in their bodies. The wailing dance cannot be unseized once it has been witnessed. The Censorate can draft the witnesses into Corvée. It cannot remove what they saw.

Hangbat is there. He watches his teaching performed in the form it was always supposed to take. He says nothing. The jar is in his hands. He doesn't open it. He doesn't need to.

**Act Four ends:** The movement has paid its costs. The network has been tested and held, partially, imperfectly, with losses that have names. Hoebat has said the thing that cannot be argued — not because it is unanswerable, but because it is chosen rather than proven. The wailing dance is in too many bodies now. Mockery has no purchase on something already witnessed. Hangbat is standing in public. The Sovereigns have failed to break the movement through attrition. The seed must be planted.

---

## ACT FIVE: THE SEED
*"What it looks like to choose anyway."*

**Dramatic question:** What does the world become when the choice is made?

**Time:** The endgame. The bloom.

---

### The Five Missions Reach Their Threshold

Each Lambda mission arrives at its local turning point in the same season — not coordinated by any central command, but by the accumulation of years of threading:

- **Cooroo** has found enough Fragment Prophets, enough scattered Rosella notes, to convene the beginning of a Parliament. Not at the Silver Wattle — the Parliament is a practice, not a place. In a living Jacaranda grove that has grown in the Eastern Ridge. The Noble Noise, for the first time since the Wattle fell, has something to respond to. The Fools have their formal counterpart again.

- **Pokero** has brought enough of the Pack back to the Code that when the Council's contract renewal comes, the Pack leadership negotiates terms the Council did not anticipate — terms that include no enforcement operations against five-species meetings. Not revolution. A renegotiated contract that reflects a Pack that has partially remembered what the Code was for.

- **Merl** has mapped every gap in the Wall's current construction. More than that — has mapped the Jacaranda root system's lateral advance through the Wall's foundation, and presented this to the Emu Congress as cartographic fact: *the Wall is already failing from below. Here is where. Here is the rate.* The Emus begin walking sections the Wall was supposed to seal. Not breaking through — walking. Through the gaps the roots opened. Which is what Emus do. Which is what they have always done.

- **Bash** has translated the Kappa Mu's five-species mission into five different registers simultaneously — to Kangaroo mob matriarchs in mob language, to Galah colonies in Noble Noise cadence, to Emu Congress in movement-logic, to Dingo Packs in the Code's click-pattern, to wombat Lo Snouts in the old weave. For the first time, all five communities have received the same message in a form their bodies understand. The translation that was the wallaby's original sacred function, performed at the scale the world needed it.

- **The Kangaroo matriarch** holds. The pool she left unguarded stays unguarded. Other mobs notice. The territorial logic begins to erode — not dramatically, not universally, but at the margins where the matriarch's decision has made a precedent.

### The Sovereign Claims

Both Sovereigns want to be present at the seed-planting. Trumbat brings his record-cutters. Tatebat brings the Queensborow aesthetic apparatus. The going-public moment was always building toward this — the founding act, the moment that becomes official history.

Trumbat positions the Wall as the Jacaranda's cradle. Tatebat positions Hoebat as his succession. Both claims are made in public, with witnesses, on the record.

### Hoebat's Five Ways Out — Enacted

Before the planting, Hoebat enacts each escape from the Sovereign trap:

**The wailing dance** — performed again, this time before an audience that includes both Sovereigns. In a Lo Snout tunnel that Trumbat's record-cutters are not present for and Tatebat's aesthetic apparatus has no frame for. The thing that neither Sovereign can claim is performed in the gap between their presences.

**The giving away** — he names the Old Way Preservationist who kept the dance alive for thirty years. The Mnemo-Mu carrier who still has the Songlines. The Lo Snout lateral who was threading before Hoebat found the Jacaranda. *These are the movement. Not me.* Said publicly, with specificity, in a way that distributes the genuine article into a hundred unclaimable hands.

**Hangbat stands** — beside Hoebat at the planting site. Not as leader. As the before that neither Sovereign was part of. Beta class. Eight years in a vault. The cloth in his body, older than the doctrine, older than the aesthetic, older than either Sovereign's claim. His presence says what no argument can: *this was already here. You were not invited in.*

**The specific truth, said once** — in the room before the planting: *Trumbat says the Wall was built for the Jacaranda. I will tell you what the Wall was built for. I was there. My people were there. The suffering was not sacred. It was not planned. It was not for us. Do not let anyone tell you your pain was always part of a design that served you.* Said once. Not repeated. Left in the air.

### The Planting

Hoebat presses the seed into the earth.

The motion is the same as the first motion of the story: ear to the ground, listening for what the earth is trying to say. But the hand is open now, not cupped. Not receiving. Releasing.

He knows what the seed is. He knows what it wants. He knows the world it grows into will not be the world the wailing dance was maintaining — that his mother's resonance, when it is finally freed from the Frequency, will return to an earth that is already becoming something neither of them was born into.

He plants it anyway. Not because the Jacaranda is good. Because the alternative is the entombed Wombiki—the countless voices of those sacrificed in the Walls—cycling in the Frequency forever, and no one left underground who remembers them as music.

Then he leaves. No speech. No declaration. Back into the tunnels. Back to the cloth.

Both Sovereigns are left at the planting site, holding a ceremony that has no subject.

### The Bloom

The Fractal Rainforest is not an event. It is a direction. And the world, for the first time, is facing it.

The first Jacaranda shoots appear where nobody expected: in the crack along the Cathedral's south wall where the silhouette of a dancer has always traced itself. In the floor of a Static pool a Kangaroo mob has quietly abandoned. In the dead eucalyptus at the Drop Bear canopy's edge, which begins, almost imperceptibly, to change.

The Frequency begins to degrade in Statborow's lowest level — not through sabotage, but because the Jacaranda's lateral roots have reached the infrastructure that carries it, and the roots metabolise what they touch. As the Frequency degrades, the entombed frequencies within it begin to surface. Old resonances. Wombiki voices, freed gradually, one at a time, from the signal that held them.

The entombed voices are released—the countless Wombiki sacrificed in the Walls, their resonance finally freed from the signal that held them. The last to release. Or the first. Depending on where you are listening from.

Hoebat, underground, in the cloth, does not hear it directly. He feels it in the substrate. The Arnam pools — slightly fuller than yesterday. The old resonance, changed but present. The earth, breathing differently than it did this morning.

The Tally does not dissolve. The Sovereigns do not fall — not yet, not dramatically. The Corvée draft does not end. The High Noses do not surrender their filtered signal.

But the world has a direction now. And direction, sustained, becomes destination.

### Tatebat's Unfinished Arc

Hoebat's reclamation worked on him. Tatebat finds himself, privately, changed in ways he cannot publicly admit without collapsing the authority the co-optation built. He holds both positions — the Queensborow aesthete for his public, something unnamed and growing for himself. He stepped halfway through the door without planning to.

Whether he takes the next step, and what it costs him when he does, is the story that continues after this one ends.

### The Final Image

The wailing dance, in the bodies of Lo Snouts who watched it and carried it home.

The old weave, in Hangbat, standing above ground for the first time in eight years, not hiding.

The cloth, distributed into a hundred hands the Sovereigns cannot reach.

The seed, in the earth, growing according to its own agenda.

And Hoebat, underground, in the place where the Jacaranda's roots are, where Hangbat taught him everything — pressing his ear to the earth, listening for what it is becoming.

Different cloth. Same pattern. Always.

## STRUCTURAL SUMMARY

| Act | Title | Core Question | Ends With |
|---|---|---|---|
| **One** | The Broken World | Who are these creatures and what was lost? | Lambda crosses. The clock begins. |
| **Two** | The Roots Take Hold | Can the threads survive their own growth? | Going public is forced by co-optation. The protection network forms. |
| **Three** | Surfacing | What is the movement actually working toward? | Hoebat knows the full truth. The choice is visible but not yet made. |
| **Four** | The Cost | What does being right cost, and who pays? | The wailing dance in too many bodies. The choice is made without certainty. |
| **Five** | The Seed | What does it look like to choose anyway? | The bloom begins. The entombed voices are released. The cloth survives. |

---

## TRILOGY MAPPING

The five-act structure maps across the three books as follows:

| Book | Acts | Ends with | Sovereigns' position |
|------|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Book One** | Acts 1–2 + early Act 3 | Hoebat goes public; Sovereigns embrace the Kappa Mu. Co-optation looks like it's working. | Peak power — they have absorbed the movement's surface form. |
| **Book Two** | Late Act 3 + Act 4 + opening of Act 5 | The Sovereigns' secrets are revealed; Muskbat's arrogance exposes the device project and the origin; the Node opens. | Collapse — their attacks exposed them; the Node ends the information monopoly. |
| **Book Three** | Act 5 climax and aftermath | The seed is planted; the Fractal Rainforest begins; the Jacaranda missionaries carry the signal through the open Node to adjacent Heart Worlds; Arnam returns; the rain. | Irrelevant — not defeated in a coup but rendered non-functional by a world that no longer runs on their systems. |

The five-act structure is the narrative shape of the full trilogy. Book One is not a complete five-act arc — it is an ascent. Book Two is the unravelling. Book Three is the bloom.

---

## THEMATIC SPINE

Each act carries the same question at increasing depth:

**Act One asks:** What is the old world?
**Act Two asks:** Can it be carried into the new one?
**Act Three asks:** What if what you are carrying is not what you think?
**Act Four asks:** Do you carry it anyway?
**Act Five answers:** Yes. In different cloth. Same pattern.
