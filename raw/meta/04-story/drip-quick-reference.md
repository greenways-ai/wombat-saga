# Drip Quick Reference — While Writing/Editing

*A one-page checklist for rapid verification during drafting. Tape this to your monitor. If you answer YES to any red flags, rewrite.*

## The Forbidden Words (Book 1)

If these appear in narration or dialogue, you have dumped:

| Category | Forbidden Terms |
|----------|----------------|
| **Cosmology** | Arnam, Feed, Brahman, Maha-Tahto, Grand Inversion, three realms, substance chain, rūpa, nāda |
| **Physics** | quantum, coherence, decoherence, resonance (as noun), phase, interference, substrate, frequency |
| **History** | D-O-G, G-O-D, the Closing, First Crossing, Satya Yuga (as named era) |
| **The Node** | Node (as proper noun), crossing (as mechanism), device (as cosmological object) |
| **The Jacaranda** | metabolize, Violet (as proper noun), pioneer species, trans-world |

**Exceptions**: 
- "resonance bell" is fine (it's the object name, not physics explanation)
- "Violet" as color description is fine (not capitalized cosmological term)
- Characters may use metaphors that accidentally approximate forbidden terms ("like something feeding")

## The Red Flag Questions

Ask these of every passage:

### ❌ Red Flag: "Is this explaining how the world works?"
**If YES → DRIP VIOLATION**

**Examples of explanation:**
- "Static works by interfering with..."
- "The reason the dance works is..."
- "What you have to understand about the three realms is..."

**Replace with:** Behavior. Consequence. Texture.

---

### ❌ Red Flag: "Could this be delivered as a lecture?"
**If YES → DRIP VIOLATION**

**Examples of lecture:**
- Long uninterrupted explanation by knowledgeable character
- "As you know..." dialogue
- Flashback that exists only to deliver backstory

**Replace with:** Fragment overheard. Argument between two partial knowledges. Physical evidence that implies history.

---

### ❌ Red Flag: "Is the narrator telling the reader what to think?"
**If YES → DRIP VIOLATION**

**Examples of telling:**
- "This was the tragedy of the Grand Inversion..."
- "What Hoebat didn't know was..."
- "The reader should understand that..."

**Replace with:** Hoebat's limited perception. Character's wrong theory. Silence where explanation would be.

---

### ❌ Red Flag: "Does this character know too much?"
**If YES → DRIP VIOLATION**

**Nobody in Book 1 knows:**
- The full cosmology
- The Sovereign origin story accurately
- What the Jacaranda actually is
- Why the wailing dance works
- What the Node really does

**Everybody in Book 1 has:**
- Partial theories
- Cultural fragments
- Personal experience
- Strong opinions based on insufficient information

---

## The Green Light Checklist

### ✅ Does the world feel bigger than the story?
- Secondary characters have opinions that don't serve the plot
- Cultures referenced that the story won't fully explore
- History implied but not delivered

### ✅ Does the physics arrive through behavior?
- Static changes how presence feels, not explained
- The dance works through physical description, not named mechanism
- Relationships have texture—thick, thin, present, absent

### ✅ Do contradictions coexist?
- Two characters have incompatible theories, both partially true
- Official history conflicts with physical evidence
- Cultural fragments suggest multiple incompatible origins

### ✅ Are the animals real first?
- Wombat behavior is wombat behavior, not symbol
- Dingo behavior is dingo behavior, not allegory
- The body is present—digging, breathing, specific weight

### ✅ Is there mystery that stays mystery?
- Some questions raised but not answered
- Some fragments remain fragments
- Some characters' knowledge has gaps they don't acknowledge

## The Single-Sentence Test

For any passage, complete this sentence:

> "This passage exists to _______."

**If the completion is:**
- "explain the cosmology" → FAIL
- "deliver backstory" → FAIL  
- "make sure the reader understands" → FAIL
- "show Hoebat experiencing" → PASS
- "let the reader feel" → PASS
- "imply a world beyond the story" → PASS

---

## The Texture Check

Every scene needs at least one element from each column:

| Physical Texture | Emotional Texture | Cultural Texture |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Clay, drain water, Tally-stone weight | Grief, humor, fear, stubbornness | Fragment of song, unexplained gesture, place name |
| Sound of bells, quality of air | Performance vs. presence | Old Tongue phrase, children's rhyme |
| Static's specific effect on environment | Connection vs. isolation | Reference to event the story won't show |

**If any column is empty** → scene lacks drip density

## The Oracle Distance

Measure every passage against Tilanmaya:

- **Book 1**: Tilanmaya does not exist. No passage can reference her, her teachings, or vocabulary she would use.
- **Book 2**: Tilanmaya appears. Passages may begin to approximate her vocabulary but should arrive through her voice, not narration.
- **Book 3**: Tilanmaya's teachings are complete. Reader should recognize what she names from two books of accumulated texture.

**If a Book 1 passage sounds like Tilanmaya could have said it** → FAIL

---

## The 12-Year-Old Test

Imagine a 12-year-old reading the passage. Ask:

- Do they know who wants what?
- Do they feel the stakes?
- Do they like the characters?
- Do they understand what's happening (not why cosmologically, but what's happening in the scene)?

**If any answer is NO** → Level 1 has failed, regardless of cosmological sophistication

---

## The Rewriting Protocol

When you find a dump, don't edit—**reimagine**:

1. **Strip the explanation**: Remove all cosmological content, all physics, all history
2. **Find the body**: What is the physical scene? Who is present? What are they doing?
3. **Find the feeling**: What should the reader feel in their body?
4. **Add texture**: What does the air feel like? What is the weight of objects? What is the quality of presence?
5. **Add fragment**: Is there a piece of unexplained culture? A phrase? A marking?
6. **Add contradiction**: Does someone have a wrong theory? A partial theory? An opinion that conflicts with evidence?
7. **Verify**: 12-year-old test. Green light checklist. No forbidden words.

## Remember

**The drip structure is not a puzzle to solve.**

The reader does not need to figure out the cosmology in Book 1. They need to:
- Want to spend time with these animals
- Feel that the world is coherent
- Trust that the author knows what they're doing
- Be curious about what they sense but don't understand

**The cosmology is not the reward.**

The world is the reward. The animals are the reward. The feeling of being in a place that extends beyond what you can see—that is the reward.

Tilanmaya gives names to what the reader has already felt.
She does not give information the reader needs to enjoy the story.

**Write as if there were no Level 4.**

Write as if the cute fluffy Australian animals were the point.
They are.
