# The Wombat Saga — Nine Act Structure (3×3)

*Three books, three acts each, nine movements from broken world to cosmic bloom. Book 3: taking the fight to the Sovereigns' origin world, using their technology to seed the Jacaranda across millions of Heart Worlds.*

---

# BOOK ONE: THE ASCENT
*"From the vault to the surface. From the personal to the political. The movement forms in one world."*

**Book One's Drip Profile:** Dense texture, sparse fragments, contested claims central. No oracle. No Maha-Tahto vocabulary. The cosmology must be felt through behavior alone.

---

## ACT I: THE BROKEN WORLD
*"What has been lost, and who is left to remember it."*

**Dramatic Question:** Who are these creatures, and what world has been broken around them?

**The World:** The Static economy in full operation. The Sovereign system at apparent stability—the Tally notching, the Frequency humming, the Wall rising. The five communities each in their corruption. The suffering is manageable, which is the most dangerous kind.

**Hoebat's Arc:** Childhood in the Eucalyptus Groves, shaped by Cornelibat's stories and Morillaboo's workshop — the forbidden bowls, the clay that answers, the listening that the Academy will have no category for. He goes to the Academy. He builds something real: a discovery in the Dead Zones below the school route, crystal bowls that make the old earth sing, the beginning of proof that the Dust-Bearer tradition was engineering, not myth. He loses it — betrayal by Barnabat, silence from Cornelibat. He descends.

Below the Academy's Dead Zones, past the Root Cathedral he has already found, deeper: he finds Hangbat. Or Hangbat finds him. Two wombats digging toward each other in the dark eventually meet.

Hangbat takes him in. This is not a philosophical handover. It is a practical arrangement: Hoebat needs somewhere to sleep that isn't the surface. Hangbat needs another pair of paws on the deep sections he has maintained alone for fifteen years. The terms are simple. You help, you eat, you stay.

What Hoebat learns first is not the Songlines, not the wailing dance, not the Kintsugi-Mu by name. He learns which cracks to leave and which to address. He learns where the water comes from in the fourth level. He learns what the smell of old clay means versus recently disturbed clay. He learns to read the dark — not as metaphor, but as practice: where the air moves and doesn't move, what sound means a section has shifted overnight, how long before a lamp runs low.

Hangbat is not a teacher in any formal sense. He shows rather than explains. He corrects rather than instructs. He has been doing this work for fifteen years and has found, to his surprise, a second wombat who can do it.

Over months — then years — the deeper knowledge accumulates the way it accumulates when you live inside a practice: not as concepts delivered, but as understanding that arrives because the work has been making room for it. The wailing dance: Hoebat sees it first without context, Hangbat alone in the Root Cathedral, striking the bowl in a particular sequence. No explanation offered. Hoebat watches. Comes back the following night to watch again. The Kintsugi-Mu has no name yet — it is just the work, the grain-running crack left alone, the against-grain crack addressed with the wall's own clay. Hoebat had already been doing it. Hangbat recognizes it in him.

He fractures. He grows. He becomes a Ghost-Digger — not because he plans to, but because it is what he is by the time he knows what he is.

And then something pulls him toward the surface. Toward a particular tree.

**The Parallel Origins:**
- **Cooroo** — The Silver Wattle falls, her mother enters grief-trance. She flies toward a sound she cannot name.
- **Pokero** — The Pack's contract is turning Dingoes into something the Code cannot recognize. He sees the lie.
- **Merl** — The Wall has severed a route his body has always known. He walks toward the disruption.
- **Bash** — A Wallaby whose gift for translation has been made purposeless.

**The Crossing:** Five creatures arrive separately, drawn by the same pull. The tree reads each of them, finds what is already true, makes it the loudest thing. Lambda is formed.

**Act I ends:** Lambda has crossed. The Jacaranda has found its vectors. The clock begins.

---

## ACT II: THE UNDERGROUND YEARS
*"The movement before it knows it is a movement."*

**Dramatic Question:** Can the threads survive their own growth?

**The World:** Iconography appears. Root-braid marks in Lo Snout tunnels. The Violet Miasma spreads. Rumors nobody can source. The Sovereigns notice something is happening. They do not yet know what.

**Hoebat's Arc:** Back in Melborow, threading. As Ghost-Digger, restoring what Grout has damaged, one tunnel at a time. The Kintsugi-Mu applied as practice, in the dark, without audience.

He encounters the movement's edges—earlier classes are active. He runs on infrastructure he cannot see.

**The Parallel Missions:**
- **Cooroo** — Shaping the Noble Noise network. Looking for Fragment Prophets.
- **Pokero** — Restoring the Dingo Code one individual at a time.
- **Merl** — Mapping the gaps the Wall created.
- **Bash** — Translating. Reactivating the function the world collapsed into relay.

**Tatebat's Co-optation Begins:** He adopts the Violet aesthetic—root-braid in Cathedral stonework, underground slang in upper burrow conversation. *Down-deep* loses precision. *In the braid* becomes social signal.

**Act II ends:** The roots are in the ground. The movement is alive. Tatebat has the aesthetic—the clock on going public has accelerated.

---

## ACT III: SURFACING
*"The movement meets the light—and the light is complicated."*

**Dramatic Question:** What happens when the underground goes public?

**The Going-Public Moment:** The iconography is too widespread to suppress. The Fractal Prophets preach openly. The Kappa Mu surfaces.

**Hoebat's Reclamation Move:** Tatebat's co-optation has spread the aesthetic everywhere. Hoebat dresses as Tatebat. Speaks his register. Uses the co-opted slang with full precision—*down-deep* meaning exactly what it originally meant.

The audience is comfortable, then the words start meaning something. Tatebat cannot call him out without admitting the original was hollow.

**The Sovereign Trap Closes:**
- **Trumbat's claim:** The Wall was built for the Jacaranda all along. The suffering was sacred.
- **Tatebat's claim:** Hoebat is his successor. Together they complete what Tatebat began.

Hoebat is surrounded. The Active Opposition asks: *How is your certainty different from theirs?*

He cannot fully answer.

**Act III ends:** The Kappa Mu is public and surrounded. The Sovereign trap is in place. The movement has survived its surfacing but at cost.

**BOOK ONE COMPLETES:** The Ascent—from vault to surface, from hidden to known. The co-optation appears to be working for the Sovereigns.

---

# BOOK TWO: THE UNRAVELLING
*"When the secrets come out. When the device is revealed. When the Node opens."*

**Book Two's Drip Profile:** Fragments accumulate and begin to be named. Tilanmaya appears. The Maha-Tahto vocabulary enters through her voice, not the narrator's.

---

## ACT IV: THE CRISIS OF TRUTH
*"What you are carrying is not what you think."*

**Dramatic Question:** What is the movement actually working toward, and can Hoebat live with the answer?

**The World Under Strain:** The Sovereigns apply sustained attrition. Corvée drafts increase. Tally-Stones of sympathizers notched deeper. Real losses accumulate—families broken, children drafted.

**The Five-Species Network—First Test:** Each thread tested at weakest point:
- **Cooroo's mapping** disrupted—early warning fails.
- **Pokero's Pack position** threatened—contract negotiation crisis.
- **Merl's egress** closed—Wall completion forces reroute.
- **Bash's relay** interrupted—coordination breaks down.

**The Crisis of Truth:** In the drainage vault. The jar open. Both signals blocked.

Hangbat tells Hoebat: the Crossing is assessment, not recognition. The Jacaranda is biological pioneer species, not conscious guide. The Fractal Rainforest will replace the old world, not restore it. What Beta class discovered. What it cost.

*I gave you the old ways so you would carry them. You gave yourself to the thing that is replacing everything I gave you.*

Hoebat does not defend. He thanks Hangbat. Says: *The old ways still remain. But in a different cloth.*

The student repairs the master. Hangbat's paralysis breaks. He becomes a supporter.

**Act IV ends:** Hoebat knows the full truth. Lambda knows the Jacaranda's agenda. The Sovereign trap is in place.

---

## ACT V: THE COST
*"What it takes to be right."*

**Dramatic Question:** What does the movement cost, and who pays?

**The World Under Maximum Pressure:** Attrition continues. The movement pays in names, in families, in futures.

**The Five-Species Network—Severe Test:**
- **Cooroo** — Operates blind, trusting pattern over data.
- **Pokero** — Chooses integrity over position.
- **Merl** — Walks new paths personally, verifying each gap.
- **Bash** — Rebuilds relay from scratch in days.
- **The Kangaroo matriarch** — Sovereigns pressure her to reverse. Whether she holds is critical.

**Hoebat's Reckoning:** The doctrine has calcified. The movement has a center—him. He is doing Kintsugi on the world and Grout on himself.

**The Wailing Dance:** Performed in a Lo Snout tunnel. Without announcement. The Censorate arrives too late. The witnesses carry it in their bodies now.

**Act V ends:** The network has held, imperfectly, with losses that have names. The wailing dance is in too many bodies.

---

## ACT VI: THE NODE OPENS
*"When the Sovereigns' origin is revealed. When crossing becomes possible."*

**Dramatic Question:** What happens when the Sovereigns' secrets are exposed?

**Muskbat's Arrogance:** The Five Sovereigns' council breaks. Muskbat pushes for accelerated device development. His boast reveals: the device project exists, has existed for generations, consumes resources that could have restored the old ways a hundred times over.

**The Device Revealed:** Deep beneath the Cathedral—the Sovereigns have been rebuilding their original crossing technology. Not the natural method—rūpa and nāda—but a mechanical prosthesis for faith.

The device is flawed. It can cross, but imperfectly. It requires enormous energy. The Sovereigns who crossed originally lost something—the capacity for manual crossing. They sealed the Node not to protect Arnamland but because they could no longer use it.

**The Node Opens:** The exposure creates resonance. The Kappa Mu's work finds an opening. The Node begins to open.

**Tilanmaya Appears:** In the desert, at the fold's edge. The first oracle. She names what they have been feeling: the three-species dynamic, the substance chain, the Grand Inversion. The Maha-Tahto vocabulary enters as confirmation, not revelation.

**The Sovereigns' Origin Revealed:** They are immigrants. They came from a failed Heart World. Their "protection" of Arnamland was protection of their own limitation.

**Act VI ends:** The Node is opening. The device is exposed. Tilanmaya has begun the naming. The movement that was local has become something that connects to other worlds.

**BOOK TWO COMPLETES:** The Unravelling—from contained opposition to existential threat. The information monopoly has ended. The Node is open.

---

# BOOK THREE: THE CROSSING
*"To the Sovereigns' home world. To take their technology. To deliver the Jacaranda to millions of Heart Worlds."*

**Book Three's Drip Profile:** The oracle completes. The cosmology becomes operational. The Many Worlds are not abstract—they are the battlefield. The Maha-Tahto architecture is the map for cosmic-scale action.

---

## ACT VII: THE EXPEDITION
*"Crossing to the Sovereign world."*

**Dramatic Question:** What awaits on the other side of the Node?

**Preparing the Crossing:** Lambda must cross to the Sovereigns' origin world—the Heart World they fled when theirs failed. This is not the gentle Crossing of the Jacaranda's summons. This is deliberate, dangerous, using the partially-opened Node without the device's protection.

Hoebat leads. Hangbat comes—his first crossing since Beta class, his return to the space where everything was lost.

The crossing is disorienting, physically demanding. The substrate on the other side smells wrong. The clay is different density. The gravity pulls at a slightly different angle. But the Star, when they dig upward, is the same Star.

**The Sovereign World:** What they find:

A Heart World further along the crystallization than Hún Nico. The Static economy there collapsed long ago. The Sovereigns who crossed to Hún Nico were refugees—not conquerors, not chosen, just desperate survivors who found a door and took it.

But the device technology remains. The Sovereigns' ancestors were engineers, not mystics. They built machines to cross when the natural way failed. Those machines still function—barely, partially, enough.

**The Occupation:** The Sovereign world is not empty. Creatures remain—wombats, dingoes, the five species, but changed. Adapted to a world where the Static has fully saturated the substrate. They live in the crystalline lattice, have learned to metabolize it, have become something other than what Lambda knows.

These creatures view the crossing wombats with suspicion. The Sovereigns who left are remembered—not as saviors but as deserters. Those who took the device and never returned. The technology that could have saved everyone, taken by the few.

**Act VII ends:** Lambda has crossed. The Sovereign world is revealed—a failed Heart World, crystallized, inhabited by creatures adapted to what the Hún Nico wombats fear. The device technology exists. But it is guarded by those who have reason to distrust anyone associated with the Sovereigns.

---

## ACT VIII: THE DEVICE
*"Taking the technology that can deliver the Jacaranda to millions."*

**Dramatic Question:** How do you take a weapon from those who need it most?

**The Device Complex:** The Sovereigns' ancestors built a crossing facility—a Node-interface that could open the fold at will, without the natural attunement of rūpa and nāda. It is massive, energy-intensive, barely maintained by the remaining engineers.

The device can cross creatures to other Heart Worlds. Not just one at a time, summoned by the Jacaranda's pull. Mass crossing. Directed crossing. The technology to deliver the Jacaranda's seed—not to the select few who hear the call, but to millions of worlds.

**The Moral Crisis:** The device is all that remains of the Sovereign world's hope. The engineers who maintain it have been trying to perfect it, to make it work reliably, to open a path to a world that hasn't failed. They have been trying for generations.

Lambda's mission requires taking this technology. Using it not to save the Sovereign world's inhabitants, but to spread the Jacaranda—to seed the Fractal Rainforest across the Many Worlds, regardless of what the inhabitants want.

The Active Opposition makes its case on the cosmic scale: *You are doing to millions of Heart Worlds what the Jacaranda did to you. Reading them. Assessing them. Using them as vectors for a biological agenda that will transform everything they are. How are you different from the Sovereigns?*

**The Negotiation:** Hoebat does not take the device by force. He speaks to the Sovereign world's engineers. He tells them the truth: the Jacaranda's agenda, the Fractal Rainforest, the transformation that is coming whether they will it or not.

He offers something: the natural crossing. The way the Jacaranda opened the Node. The method that doesn't require the device, doesn't drain the world's remaining energy, doesn't depend on technology that is failing.

The exchange: the device for the teaching. The engineers give Lambda the technology to spread the Jacaranda. Lambda gives them the wailing dance, the Kintsugi-Mu, the old ways that might restore their world's coherence without the device's drain.

**Tilanmaya's Cosmic Teaching:** On the Sovereign world, the oracle completes the architecture. The Many Worlds are not separate—they are connected through the quantum vacuum, through the shared Star, through the God-Kind's breath. What happens in one Heart World affects all.

The Grand Inversion happened in the Human World. The Static contamination flows downstream through all the Heart Worlds. The Jacaranda's spread is not invasion—it is immune response. The Many Worlds are one body, and the body is fighting infection.

**Act VIII ends:** Lambda has the device. The technology to deliver the Jacaranda to millions of Heart Worlds. The exchange is made—the old ways for the new technology. The Sovereign world's engineers have the teaching. The cosmic mission is now possible.

---

## ACT IX: THE SEEDING
*"Delivering the Jacaranda to millions of Heart Worlds."*

**Dramatic Question:** What does it mean to transform the cosmos?

**The Device Activated:** Lambda returns to Hún Nico with the technology. The device interfaces with the Node, amplifies its opening, makes crossing controllable, scalable, directed.

But Hoebat makes a choice: the device will not be used to force the Jacaranda on any world. It will be used to open the possibility. To create the conditions where the Jacaranda can be invited, can respond to the readiness of each world, can operate as it did in Hún Nico—finding those who are already seeking.

The device becomes a door, not a weapon.

**The Jacaranda Missionaries:** Lambda members cross to other Heart Worlds. Not as conquerors, not as missionaries with doctrine, but as carriers of possibility.

- **Cooroo** — Takes the Noble Noise to worlds where the aerial signal has been silenced. The Parliament reconvenes not in one place but across the Many Worlds.
- **Pokero** — Brings the Dingo Code to packs that have been corrupted by Static economies elsewhere. The Code becomes trans-world, a network of ethics spanning Heart Worlds.
- **Merl** — Maps the Many Worlds' songlines, the paths between that the device makes visible but the Emus must walk.
- **Bash** — Translates across species and worlds, the wallaby function now operating at cosmic scale.
- **Hoebat** — The seed, carried in his body, planted world by world. Not forcing growth. Creating conditions.

**The Sovereigns' Response:** Trumbat and Tatebat, left behind in Hún Nico, watch their technology being used for purposes they didn't authorize. They are powerless to stop it—the device is now part of the Jacaranda's network, not theirs.

Tatebat's unfinished arc: he steps through the door. Partially, imperfectly. He begins, finally, to move toward what he has been co-opting.

**The Bloom Across Worlds:** The Fractal Rainforest doesn't grow everywhere at once. It grows where the conditions are right—where the wailing dance has prepared the substrate, where the Kintsugi-Mu has maintained the Compassion Gaps, where creatures are ready to receive it.

World by world, the Static is metabolized. The Frequency degrades. The entombed voices are released—the Wombiki sacrificed in the Walls, and billions like them across the Many Worlds, freed from the walls that held them.

**The Final Image:**

Hoebat, on a new Heart World, one of millions. He has just planted a seed. The local creatures—wombats or their equivalents—watch him with the same mixture of hope and fear that he once brought to the Jacaranda.

He presses his ear to the ground. Listens. The substrate here is different—different density, different resonance, different history. But it responds. It always responds, when you listen.

He feels it: the seed taking root. The Jacaranda beginning its work. The Fractal Rainforest growing—not as invasion, but as response. As the Many Worlds' immune system activating.

He looks up. Through the Star's light, he imagines he can see the other Heart Worlds—Cooroo's Parliament reconvening somewhere, Pokero's Code being restored, Merl's paths being walked, Bash translating across impossible distances.

Different cloth. Same pattern. Across all the Many Worlds. Always.

**Act IX ends:** The seeding has begun. The device is in service of the Jacaranda's spread, but governed by the ethic Lambda established—invitation, not imposition. The Many Worlds are transforming. The Sovereigns' technology has been turned to purposes they didn't intend. The cloth survives, multiplied across the cosmos.

**BOOK THREE COMPLETES:** The Crossing—from one world to the Many. The Jacaranda delivered not by the Sovereigns' conquest but by Lambda's invitation. The technology turned to gift. The cosmos transformed.

## Thematic Progression

**Book One:** What was lost? Can it be found in one world?

**Book Two:** What are you actually carrying? What happens when the sealed opens?
