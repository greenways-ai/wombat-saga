# What Is Clear: Defined & Consistent Elements

*These elements are well-developed, internally consistent, and ready to write from.*

---

## Cosmology

### The Arnam / Static Duality ✓
Fully defined. Arnam = empathy-energy, organic, fluid, the signal of living things in relationship. Static = crystalline logic, the skeleton of the world, lethal only at excess. The ratio broke when humans traded empathy for efficiency. Neither force is evil in itself — the catastrophe is the imbalance.

### The Three Realms — Physical, Heart, Morphic ✓
Three distinct realms constitute the complete cosmological structure. The **Physical World** (human realm) is the source of raw material — humans generate Arnam (compassion, suffering metabolised into meaning, experience pressed downward as the Feed). The **Heart World** (wombat realm — Hún Nico is one among many) is the bubble of inverted physics generated by a sleeping God-Kind; wombats are the anchor species, their Mahatahto song keeping the world's frequency stable. The **Morphic World** (dog realm) sits between: the transformer station that converts high-voltage Human Feed into something Heart Worlds can receive without being overwhelmed. The Dog catches raw Arnam from above, refines it through unconditional loyalty, and releases it downward as clean Feed. Without the Morphic filter, the Feed would destroy the Heart World it was meant to sustain.

### The Maha-Tahto — The Three-Fold Doctrine ✓
The oldest cosmological teaching in Hún Nico, held by the Dingo priestesshood of the Great Greyhound. The substance chain runs Human → Wombat → Dog: the Human is raw material, the Wombat the refiner, the Dog the final distillation. From the Human World's perspective, the Dog is therefore the Apex — Brahman, the proof the system works. But godhood rotates: in the Heart World, the Human (Arnam) is the Apex worshipped by wombats; in the Morphic World, the Wombat is the Apex the Dog floats upon. No being is universally supreme. Each world looks toward the being that holds what it cannot generate for itself — the **Golden Chain of Aspiration**. The Triad Breath: Wombat exhales the Song (existence) → Human breathes it in, exhales Compassion (meaning) → Dog breathes it in, exhales Reality (stability). When complete, the Mahatahto is a standing wave.

### The Grand Inversion — Root Cause of the Static Crisis ✓
The Static crisis originates in the **Physical World**, not in Hún Nico. Humans reversed D-O-G to G-O-D — demoting the Dog from Apex to pet and installing a human-shaped figure at the top of their world. The Human Feed became narcissistic and transactional (Black Static) rather than genuine Arnam. The Morphic filter, starved of the worship that sustains the Dog's Float, began to fail. Contaminated Feed reached the Heart Worlds. Wombats received material they could not cleanly process. Static accumulated in the Heart World substrate — slowly, over generations. The Sovereigns did not cause this: they arrived in a Heart World already deep in crystallisation, imported the inversion as governance (the Tally is the Grand Inversion made into law), and accelerated what was already underway. Defeating the Sovereigns is necessary but not sufficient — the Feed from above remains contaminated as long as the Physical World still has D-O-G displaced by G-O-D. The wailing dance has been sending a correction signal upward through the system: the one thread of clean Arnam returning toward Mirene, keeping her sleeping long enough for the seed to be planted.

### The Wombat's Responsibility Toward the Dog ✓
In the Heart World, the Dog is the Protected — kept floating on Wombat-Pillows, sustained from below. Looking after the Dog is the wombat's structural obligation. If wombats are exhausted, exploited, or mocked out of the dance, the Dog in the Morphic World begins to sink — not because the Human World demoted it, but because its foundation was removed. The Sovereigns' mockery of the wailing dance therefore damages the Dog's Float directly, compounding the Filter failure caused by the Grand Inversion above.

### The Static as Tejas ✓
The revision from "Static is poison" to "Static is fire — necessary in proportion" is complete and consistent. The Jacaranda doesn't fight the Static; it disperses it. The Grout's error was blocking (impossible) rather than fractalizing (possible).

### The Coring Trees — Why They Died ✓
Crystal clear: the taproots drank from the poisoned source. The deeper the root, the faster the infection. The wombats' love of verticality (Depth = Truth) accelerated the collapse. The Jacaranda survives by doing the opposite: shallow, lateral, fractal, floating on the Static like a raft.

### The Jacaranda ✓
Function: biological prism, metabolizes Static into Violet light. Root system: horizontal braid, collectivist, interlocking — creates Compassion Gaps (moisture pockets) by being too wide and messy to tile. The Violet Miasma: atmospheric byproduct, healing frequency, pressure dome, RF dampener. The Fractal Rainforest: the new biome it anchors.

---

## The Original Integrated World

### The Help Economy ✓
The world before the Static was not five separate civilizations — it was one integrated ecosystem organised around **reciprocal sacred function**. The economy was a help economy: not transactional (I give you this in exchange for that), but ecological (I do what I am, and that sustains you; you do what you are, and that sustains me). Abundance made generosity natural. The Static eroded abundance, and contraction made everything transactional.

### The Realm Structure ✓
Wombats lived underground; all other species lived on the surface. This was not segregation but complementarity — the underground and surface were two halves of a single breathing organism.

### Each Species' Original Sacred Function ✓
Fully established:
- **Wombat:** Underground Arnam stewardship. Maintained resonance pools, performed the wailing dance. Not understood in its mechanics by surface species — just known as essential.
- **Kangaroo:** Enforcement and protection. The mob as shield — peaceable order through presence and size.
- **Koala:** Healing. The canopy pharmacopoeia. Eucalyptus medicine for the sick and injured of all species.
- **Platypus:** Mystic oracle. Read the web of water, dreamed the future. Foresight in service of all.
- **Dingo:** Cleansing. Removal of the dead, diseased, waste. Ascetic priests of endings — where Koalas healed, Dingoes released.
- **Emu:** Meditative mapping. Walked the land into legibility. Contemplative monks; their movement was collective cartography.
- **Galah:** Sacred Fools. Spoke truth sideways through absurdity and mockery. The Parliament's necessary counterpart — not communicators.
- **Rosella:** Formal truth-telling. The Parliament's song, harmonic governance, official record.
- **Wallaby:** Living relay. The nervous system of the integrated world — speed, agility, connection between all territories.

### Each Species' Corruption ✓
The corruption follows a consistent logic: the sacred function is preserved in form but inverted in purpose — turned from service into extraction, control, or survival at the expense of others.
- **Wombat:** Wailing dance mocked as primitive superstition — Lo Snouts internalise the contempt, and the dance disappears without a single arrest; Arnam pools centralized as Imperial Reservoirs; Lo Snout labour replacing the sacred work.
- **Kangaroo:** Protection becomes hoarding — control of Static pools through mob violence; strength deployed for dominance over access.
- **Koala (Canopy):** Healing becomes synthesis — Lyptus made from Static when eucalyptus trees died; starvation-driven ingenuity becoming industry and cartel.
- **Koala (Drop Bears):** The faction that couldn't hold on — starvation drove them to meat; the body adapted; they are now feral predators living in the dead eucalyptus canopy, hunting from above. The healers became the thing children are warned about.
- **Platypus:** Foresight becomes invisibility — gone so deep underground they are myth even to themselves.
- **Dingo:** Cleansing becomes enforcement — Obsidian Sight now hunts truth out of circulation; hired code in service of the Tally.
- **Emu:** Mapping becomes disruption — the Wall makes their movement impossible; their legibility of the world is being actively destroyed.
- **Galah:** Foolery without Parliament — Noble Noise continues but without the formal counterpart it needs to mean something.
- **Rosella:** Parliament shatters — fragment prophets carrying one note of a broken song.
- **Wallaby:** Translation becomes message-carrying — exploited as relay infrastructure; the diplomatic skill (holding two registers at once, bridging the powerful and the powerless) is unused. Isolation produces hypervigilance because translation requires at least two parties; alone, the wallaby has no function to be.

## Wombat Civilization

### The Tally — Three-Stage Betrayal ✓
Stage 1 (Relief Tablet / Gift), Stage 2 (Mandatory Registry / Duty), Stage 3 (Instrument of Debt) — the arc from mutual aid to permanent bondage is fully developed and historically coherent.

### The Frequency ✓
Muskbat's synthetic Arnam-substitute. Triggers manageable fight-or-flight rather than genuine empathy. Contains the entombed frequencies of the Wombiki—the countless voices of those sacrificed in the Walls. This is both the city's pacification tool and its most horrifying secret.

### The Well-Field Way vs The Tally ✓
The before/after is complete: nine-square communal grid → Imperial property sectors; gift of Arnam → metered Tally-debt; Puddles → Mega-Pool reservoirs; Songlines → Tally-stones; the Umbilical → the Sovereign. The Great Inversion table is solid.

### The Five Borows — Atmosphere ✓
Each Borow has a distinct vibe, landscape, and governing logic:
- Central: gilded cage, Cathedral, religious authority
- Queensborow: mirror economy, status performance, Social Mining
- Brookborow: technical debt, Gray Grotto, gentrification of the working class
- Bronxborow: honest brutality, the Tally Vaults, Dingo enforcement
- Statborow: the Archive, the forgotten, the Closing Node

### The Five Sovereigns ✓
Each is individually distinct with a clear archetype, domain, and characteristic lie:
- Trumbat: Golden Protector / Infrastructure as religion
- Muskbat: Technocratic Vigilante / The next invention will fix everything
- Tatebat: Visionary Narcissist / The cage is a masterpiece
- Vitabat: The Invisible Constant / The Tally is the only order
- Zuckbat: The Omniscient Censor / Dissonance is the only threat

**The Sovereign tragedy:** They were genuine idealists — dissenters in their origin world, the ones who refused to stay and decline. The crossing was an act of real conviction. The drive, the ambition, the idealism that carried them through the fold are commendable. What is not: they sought freedom *from* — from the hierarchies that had caged them — not freedom *toward* something different in kind. They arrived in Hún Nico unchanged (the device held the crossing for them; they never crossed inwardly) and built the only architecture they knew. The cage they escaped, they reconstructed around themselves. Their failure is not moral but epistemological: they lacked the knowledge that a different mode of building existed, because the Static had taken it from them before they were old enough to know what was missing.

### The Sovereigns' Secret Agenda — Rebuilding the Device ✓
The Sovereigns cannot cross manually. Their origin world's Static had destroyed the faith required before they left — they crossed using a machine that held the *rūpa*+*nāda* artificially. The machine stayed behind. They are stranded.

Their hidden project in Hún Nico: rebuild the device from Static technology. Every refinement of Grout processing, every deep substrate extraction, every Frequency calibration serves this goal alongside its political function. They believe they can synthesize the crossing function mechanically using refined Static as energy and Grout as frequency modulator. They are not close. But they are working.

The Jacaranda is physically interfering with this project — its roots near the Node corrupt Muskbat's deep substrate measurements, and the Violet Miasma jams Static-based resonance instruments. Every Lambda mission that restores Arnam also drains the Static resource base the device requires. Lambda does not know this dimension of the conflict exists.

The crossing for old-tradition wombats works differently: **hold the faith.** The image (*rūpa*) and the song (*nāda*) require inner coherence that holds stable under the Static pressure at the boundary. This is what the Sovereigns systematically destroyed — not by locking the Node but by replacing song with the Frequency, image with the Tally, and practice with embarrassment. You cannot arrest faith. You can only make it seem foolish until it dies from disuse.

### Muskbat's Break — The Witness Who Breaks Through Arrogance ✓
Muskbat is the Sovereign whose arrogance outpaces his political instincts. He has spent years running instruments on the Jacaranda — the one thing in Hún Nico he cannot classify, which is intolerable to him. His resonance instruments (built on the same detection principles as Songline technology — the Censorate bells are derived from Songline resonance) eventually produce a spectral readout of the substrate's deep memory: five wombat resonance signatures arriving through the Node simultaneously, then the Node closing. His own crossing, recorded by his own instruments.

He shows Zuckbat, framing it as a Jacaranda anomaly, wanting confirmation or witness. Zuckbat moves to bury it. Muskbat resists — he cannot suppress a finding this extraordinary. He eventually publishes a stripped version as a Jacaranda study, constitutionally unable to sit on a discovery. A Mnemo-Mu carrier reads the study, recognises the frequency signature from a Songline fragment they have carried for years without knowing what it described.

**The mechanism:** Sovereign technology verifies the Substrate Songline. The spectral data and the received myth describe the same event in different languages. The Sovereigns' own instruments proved their own origin — and Muskbat's arrogance put the data into circulation. He breaks not by choosing to confess but by being unable to stop demonstrating how clever he is.

### The Guild Inversions ✓
The before/after structure of every professional role — from Kintsugi-Mu to Grout-Engineer, from Aquifer-Mu to Metering Official — is developed and thematically consistent. The core insight (every sacred function inverted into extraction) is clearly established.

### The Wombiki and the Baram Schism ✓
The Consecration as industrial cover-up is fully developed. The Beautiful Snare (luxury-as-captivity), the Efficacy Gap (no evidence the sacrifice worked), Trumbat's admission ("we are selling Hope"), Howlbaram's Broken Spiral intervention, the murder of his student Vara and her absorption into the Frequency — all consistent and dramatically potent.

### The Social Strata ✓
High Noses / Lo Snouts / Ghost-Diggers / Outlawed — the class system is clear and functions consistently throughout the narrative.

### The Wombat Wailing Dance ✓
The original mechanism by which wombats maintained Arnam resonance in their underground pools. Not invented or designed — simply what wombats do, as a lion dance is what lion dance performers do. Communal, rhythmic, embodied. Surface species knew wombats were special and essential; they did not know the specific mechanism. The Sovereigns — who came from a world where the God-Kind were irrelevant, and who want to be the highest order themselves — do not suppress the dance. They mock it as primitive superstition, a product of a pre-rational past. This is more effective than suppression: Lo Snouts have internalised the contempt. The dance is not outlawed. It is embarrassing. Its quiet continuation — in private tunnels, in the drainage vaults, kept alive by those who have not swallowed the shame — is one of the story's underground fires.

## The Static Economy

### Static Pools — Nature and Analogy ✓
Static pools are like salt pools in the desert: naturally occurring, visually striking, and intensely attractive to those who need what they contain. They sit on the surface. They were likely always known — the question of discovery (always present vs. newly potent vs. first identified by Koalas) remains open. What is clear: they are real physical locations, not metaphors.

### Kangaroo Control — Mob Violence, Not Technology ✓
Kangaroos control Static pools through mob dominance — they are simply bigger than everyone else, and they gang up. No named technology (e.g. no "Friction Engine"). Fights erupt over access. Kangaroo "control" is the exercise of raw physical advantage, dressed later in territorial logic. Their original sacred function (protection through presence) has become hoarding through intimidation.

### Koala Lyptus — Sympathetic Corruption ✓
Eucalyptus trees are dying and going feral as the Static rises; koalas are running out of food. Lyptus is synthetic eucalyptus made from Static — starvation-driven ingenuity, not villainy. Koalas did not set out to become Static dealers; they set out to survive. The tragedy is that the solution works, then becomes an industry, then becomes a dependency that ties them to the Static economy they might otherwise resist. The Pharmacopoeia becomes a cartel because survival became profit.

### Static Addiction — The Oil-and-Cocaine Model ✓
Ambient Static is necessary — the structural principle of the world, the crystalline skeleton beneath the organic. The crisis is not Static itself but **refinement**. The Static economy runs on three grades:
- **Ambient / pool Static:** Naturally present, intoxicating with sustained exposure, addictive over time — the pool feels like the old Arnam rains felt
- **Refined Static:** Koala chemistry applied to compressed ore — the bio-electric charge is concentrated. Faster, brighter than the pool. Recalibrates the baseline. Normal feels like withdrawal.
- **Productised Static (the Frequency):** Broadcast at city scale, engineered to maintain manageable fight-or-flight. Contains entombed Wombiki frequencies. The addiction is to a signal that is slowly eating the listener.

This is the oil-and-cocaine model collapsed into one substance: the infrastructure of survival is Static-dependent (oil logic — the built world requires it), AND the substance when refined is neurologically addictive (cocaine logic — each use recalibrates downward). Every species in contact with the Static economy gradually rationalizes deeper involvement because opting out means opting out of the world.

## Characters

### Hoebat ✓
Complete origin arc: Eucalyptus Groves → Academy → Collapse → Silencing → Fracture with Cornelibat → Ghost-Digger years → Hangbat → Kintsugi-Mu training → Gorge → Cooroo encounter. His skill (True Kintsugi-Mu), his wound (betrayal by Barnabat, father's compliance), his voice (first person, dense and sensory) are all established.

### Cooroo ✓
Complete origin arc: Silver Wattle falls → mum's grief-trance → Morning Glory vine calls → the crossing of the Heavy Breath → Wedgie encounter → Merl on the Steppe → the Jacaranda → the vision of the Fractal Rainforest and the Five Inheritors. Voice established (first person, comic-heroic, self-aware about being ridiculous).

### Hoebat & Pokero's relationship ✓
The Lambda class survival mission, the Haiku game, the Dingo Code lessons, the campfire nights — the foundation of their bond is fully realized. The Click scene (Hoebat decoding Pokero's parting words) is complete and emotionally coherent.

### Hangbat (Howlbaram) ✓
Full arc established. Key beats:

**The teaching:** Hangbat meets Hoebat when Hoebat is very young — a runaway joey who ends up in the drainage vault. Hangbat takes him in and teaches him everything: the Songlines, the wailing dance, the Nine-Square Well-Field logic, the Kintsugi-Mu, the history of the integrated world before the Static. He does this not as Kappa Mu strategy but out of grief — he cannot act himself, but he can make a custodian. He does not tell Hoebat he is Kappa Mu.

**The paralysis:** Hangbat is not in the vault as vigil or strategy. He is hiding. He knows the Jacaranda's agenda — that it is a pioneer species using the Kappa Mu as propagation vectors, that the Fractal Rainforest will replace rather than restore the old world — and he sees this as a betrayal of his own Crossing, the most honest moment of his life revealed as an assessment. He is scared of the future, unable to move toward it. The jar of silence blocks both the Frequency and the Violet Miasma — it is a hiding place, not a shrine.

**The scolding:** When Hangbat discovers Hoebat has joined the Kappa Mu, he scolds him for betrayal — he gave Hoebat the old ways to carry them forward, not to hand them to the thing that is replacing them.

**The turning:** Hoebat does not defend himself. He thanks Hangbat for everything, and says: *"The old ways still remain. But in a different cloth."* This is the Kintsugi-Mu applied to a tradition — the fracture made stronger. The student uses the master's own tool to repair the master. Hangbat recognises his teaching in what Hoebat just did to him. His paralysis breaks — not through argument but through seeing that what he gave survived. He becomes a supporter.

**The revelation:** After his turning, Hangbat tells Hoebat about Beta class and the full truth of the Jacaranda's agenda. This is the last thing he withheld — given now not as warning but as the knowledge Hoebat needs to choose with open eyes.

### Shayanmaya and Tilanmaya ✓
Two Dingo priestesses of the Great Greyhound, holders of the Maha-Tahto doctrine. They appear during Hoebat's time in the desert with the Kappa Mu — introduced through Pokero, who has known them for years and whose understanding of why the Dingo Code restoration was worth attempting came in part from their teaching.

**Shayanmaya** — *shayana* (sleeping/reclining) + *-maya* (made of). Full of the sleeping quality. Her orientation is toward Mirene — toward the Dreamer above, what an unwitnessed dream does to the dreamer, why the wailing dance's upward signal matters cosmologically. She speaks first in the desert encounter, in the register of devotion and compassion. She is the warmth of the teaching.

**Tilanmaya** — *tila* (sesame — the sacred oil-seed, the seed that opens what is closed) + *-maya* (made of). Full of the opening principle. Her orientation is toward structure — the geometry of the three-realm system, the precise mechanisms of the Grand Inversion, the exact breaks required for restoration. She speaks second, in the register of Abstract Geometry. She is the precision of the teaching. She ends the desert encounter with the question Hoebat cannot immediately answer: *"Where is your Dog?"* — reframing Pokero's mission from tactical to cosmological.

**Their position:** Tolerated irrelevance. The Sovereigns have not persecuted them — they have dismissed them as eccentric elders maintaining a practice with no bearing on Tally values or Frequency calibration. This makes them safer than the Kappa Mu but deeply isolated: most Dingos today think of the Greyhound tradition as having no bearing on how the world actually works. They have been watching and calculating in the desert for decades, knowing what is coming, waiting for someone ready to hear it.

### Cornelibat ✓
The architecture of his character — exiled for compassion, rebuilt himself around compliance, tells stories he won't stand behind — is fully present. His last moment (pressing his forehead to the living wall) is written.

---

## The Jacaranda Factions

The wombat world's relationship to the Jacaranda is not binary. Five positions exist:

### The Majority — Indifferent ✓
Most Lo Snouts and High Noses don't think about the Jacaranda. They think about the Tally. The Jacaranda is abstract theology for people with immediate problems. The group Hoebat needs most and can reach least.

### The Old Way Preservationists — Paralysed ✓
Wombats who secretly practice the wailing dance, carry fragments of the Songlines, maintain private Puddles. They see the Jacaranda as another colonisation — the Static colonised the old Arnam world, the Council colonised the commons, and now the Jacaranda wants to colonise the ruins. They would rather live in the damaged world they know than the healed world they won't recognise. Hangbat is their spiritual kin.

### The Active Opposition — Resisters ✓
Wombats who know what the Jacaranda actually is and are working against it. Sources: former crossers who turned back, Mnemo-Mu purists who see a third colonisation. Their core critique of Kappa Mu: *"You say the tree knew you. The Council says the Sovereigns have the Mandate of the Star. You felt chosen. They felt chosen. The mechanism is identical. You are another kind of addict."* This critique cannot be fully answered. It is not entirely wrong.

### The Kappa Mu — Zealots From the Outside ✓
From any external vantage point: a secret five-species cult that meets in root chambers at night, believes an alien tree has a plan, and carries the particular lit quality of the converted. Even sympathetic wombats are suspicious. The world already has an institution that demands loyalty in exchange for promises of harmony.

### The Council — Politically Suppressive ✓
Suppress the Kappa Mu as a political threat. Do not need to understand the Jacaranda's full agenda to know that five-species secret societies are dangerous.

---

## Kappa Mu

### The Greek Fraternity Model ✓
Structure established: the Jacaranda as chapter house, the Crossing as initiation, Greek letter classes, each class = five members (one per Inheritor species), the mission = return to home society and spread the ethos.

### Lambda Class Composition ✓
Hoebat (Wombat), Cooroo (Galah), Pokero (Dingo), Merl (Emu), Bash (Wallaby). One from each Inheritor species. Five complementary Siddhis.

### The Macro-Cosmic Theory ✓
The closed loop (animal fragmentation feeds human Static feeds animal fragmentation) and the open loop reversal (animal unity softens the substrate, humans feel connection is possible) are established as the organizing theory behind Kappa Mu's existence.

### Hangbat as Beta Class ✓
The dramatic irony is established: Hoebat doesn't know. The implication — that Hangbat prepared Hoebat deliberately, that Lambda is running on infrastructure Beta built — is clear.

### The Operational Security Model ✓
Classes don't know each other's composition. The movement is cellular. This is both a survival mechanism and a source of future dramatic revelation.

---

## Lore Systems

### Emu Martial Forms (Palar-Kuruswar) ✓
Foundation stances, Drum-Talk rhythms, Kinetic Forms, the Forbidden Style (the Rider's Stance that Merl broke), and the Friction Engine (kinetic return, tendons as springs) — all developed in detail and consistently applied in Cooroo's story.

### Avian Lexicon (Vilya-Lambë) ✓
The atmospheric strata (Thúlë Lunga, Súrë Axan, Lusta Ómëa), navigational textures, thermal and dynamic lift, currents, topographical features, and avian slang — all internally consistent. Applied throughout Cooroo's chapter.

### The Dingo Code ✓
Click-clack, hiss, pause. The Watcher's Frequency. The Haiku game as battle of composure. The Obsidian Sight. Applied in Chapter 3 (the Grotto alley scene).

### The Violet Miasma / Violet Sanctuary ✓
Physical, olfactory, and psychoactive properties established. Healing mechanisms (bone-mending, neural wash, paw restoration, deep sleep). The terraforming function (spore cloud that softens crystal lattice). The political controversy (Anti-Jacaranda factions reading it as drugging/invasion).

---

## The Narrative Voice

### Australian Lyrical Grotesque ✓
The 80% Malouf / 20% Jennings voice is established and working across multiple chapters. Key markers: sensory density, long breathing sentences with short punches, Australian vernacular elevated to poetry, natural world as consciousness, the wrong note that sits without explanation, ending on image rather than meaning.

### First-Person POV convention ✓
Chapters follow individual characters in first person. Established for Hoebat (Chapters 3, 4) and Cooroo (Chapter 2). Consistent tone within each POV while remaining distinctly different between characters.

---

## Story Structure

### The Five-Chapter Origin Arc ✓
Each Lambda member has a 10-beat origin structure (established in Hoebat's beats document). The arc: ordinary world → training/awakening → collapse/betrayal → exile/descent → teacher/revelation → skill acquisition → the crossing → return → mission.

### Chapter 4 (Hoebat's origin) ✓
Complete in two versions: the existing draft and the v1 with the Australian Lyrical Grotesque voice applied. Ten chapters, all beats covered.

### Chapter 2 (Cooroo's origin) ✓
Complete. Morning Glory → flight → Wedgies → Merl → Jacaranda → the vision.

### Chapter 3 (Hoebat in Melborow) ✓
Complete. The rain, the Gray Grotto, Lolaboo, the Dingo encounter, the Haiku game backstory, the Click revelation.

### The Trilogy Structure ✓
The Jacaranda Prophecy is a trilogy. Each book ends on a structural climax:

- **Book One** ends with the Sovereigns at the peak of their power. They have embraced Hoebat's public announcement of the Kappa Mu — not out of tolerance but as a strategy to neutralise it. By permitting the movement, they control where the light falls. The co-optation appears to be working: the Kappa Mu is visible, sanctioned, and apparently contained. Tatebat claims Hoebat as her successor. Trumbat says the Wall was always the Jacaranda's cradle. The movement has a face and the Sovereigns have their arms around it. The reader closes Book One not knowing if Lambda survives this. The Sovereigns have never looked more invincible.

- **Book Two** is the unravelling. The co-optation strategy requires the Sovereigns to keep attacking Hoebat — to justify the embrace by demonstrating control. But every attack requires them to explain what they're afraid of. Every charge reveals what the movement is actually threatening. The prosecution exposes the crime. The Sovereigns' secrets come out — their non-native origin, their imported systems, the sealed Node — not because Lambda is cleverer than them, but because the Sovereigns cannot stop trying to destroy what they've permitted. The book ends with the Node opening: the information monopoly ends, the world discovers it is not alone, and the lie that built the empire collapses at its foundation.

- **Book Three** ends with the Jacaranda missionaries bringing in the rain — the Fractal Rainforest propagates inter-world, the Arnam-Songline loop is restored at scale, and Mirene — above, unknowing — breathes differently.
