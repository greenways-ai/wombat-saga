# The Mythic Voice
## *On writing the Ten Trials as traditional myth*

---

These are traditional myths. They are recounted as fact. They do not explain themselves.

---

## The World

The world in which the Trials happen has its own laws. The people inside it treat those laws as ordinary. They are surprised by events — not by the fact that events of this kind can occur. A creature comes through a wall. This is not commented on. What is commented on is what it does next.

The supernatural is not announced. It enters through ordinary doors, uses ordinary hands. The wrongness of a place reveals itself through accumulation — small observations, one after another, each one slightly off in a direction the reader cannot yet name. By the time the reader understands what they are in the presence of, they have already been inside it for some time.

---

## Surprise

Nothing is foreshadowed. The reader travels at exactly the same pace as the characters. What is hidden from the characters is hidden from the reader. What surprises them surprises the reader.

This requires resisting the impulse to prepare the ground — the subordinate clause that softens the landing, the paragraph that names the danger before it arrives, the sentence that begins *unbeknownst to*. These are acts of mercy toward the reader. Do not show them mercy. Put them in the same room and close the door.

When something bad happens, it happens. The previous paragraph was about something else entirely.

---

## Characters

Characters act. Their inner lives appear through what they do, not through what is described about them. A character who is frightened walks faster. A character who is grieving sets things down too carefully. A character who is ashamed looks at the floor. Do not write: *she felt ashamed.* Write the floor.

What they say is what they say. No character explains their situation for the reader's benefit, because no one does this. No character prepares the listener for the thing they are about to say.

---

## Description

Describe what is encountered. Not what it means, not how it works, not what its function is in a larger system.

The cold is cold, and it reaches for a specific warm place. Describe which place. The singing is singing, and it makes a specific thing happen in the chest. Describe the thing. Do not name the mechanism. Do not name the system. The reader will understand what they are encountering before they can explain it, which is the correct order.

The uncanny lives in specificity: not *they moved efficiently* but *one of them adjusted his arm before they lifted him, tilted his head back slightly, the way you would prepare something that needed to travel.* Not *the cold was organized* but *every surface was the same temperature, and the sameness was its own kind of wrong.*

---

## Language

No technical language. Nothing ends in *-ize.* Nothing is a *system, mechanism, capacity, frequency,* or *differential.* If the word belongs in a report, it does not belong here.

If you find yourself explaining how something works, stop. Describe what it does to a body. That is all that is needed.

## The Doctrine

The moral of each Trial is carried by the events. It does not need to be stated. If it needs to be stated, the events did not do their job.

The doctrine may be given at the end, briefly, but as something Chewbat feels in his body while walking — not as a lesson delivered by the author. He recognizes it by its weight.

## The Model

*Liaozhai Zhiyi* — Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, Pu Songling.

The qualities to carry:
- Events are recounted plainly, as if by someone who was there
- The supernatural enters without preamble and is treated as a fact
- Characters respond to strange things with pragmatism, not wonder — wonder would slow them down
- The horror is domestic: it happens in kitchens, at hearth-fires, in houses where someone has just offered you food
- The eerie is in the implications, not the events themselves — what the event means about the nature of the world
- Moral weight without moral instruction

The qualities to leave behind:
- The frame story (our stories are told directly, not through a collector)
- The irony at the end (these are not fables; the doctrine is earned, not administered)
