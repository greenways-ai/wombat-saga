# Open Questions: What Needs to Be Decided

*Organised by priority. Story-blocking questions must be answered before those scenes can be written. World-defining questions shape the feel of the whole. Enrichment questions can wait.*

*For what has already been resolved, see `04-story/what-is-clear.md`. Major resolutions since the last revision: Closing Node fully established, Sovereign origin confirmed (immigrants with a device, rebuilding from Static), crossing mechanism (image + song + faith), wailing dance mocked not suppressed, trilogy structure confirmed, chakra map, founding myths, Muskbat's break.*

## Priority 1: Story-Blocking

*These gaps prevent specific scenes or chapters from being written.*

### The Crossing Ceremony
**What does the Kappa Mu Crossing actually look like?**

We know the Jacaranda reads the creature and the standing-together under the roots constitutes the oath. But the ritual itself is unwritten.
- Who crosses first — does order matter?
- Is there a spoken element, or is it entirely felt/vibrational?
- Does the tree do something visible, or is the experience entirely internal?
- How long does it take?
- What does a creature feel afterward that they didn't feel before?
- Are all five present simultaneously, or do they arrive separately and the Crossing only completes when all five have stood beneath the roots?
- How does this relate to the *rūpa*+*nāda* crossing mechanism — does the Jacaranda Crossing activate the same capacity, or is it a different kind of threshold?

**Why it's blocking:** The Root Chamber scene in Chapter 3 references the Crossing but doesn't dramatize it. If this scene is to be a chapter, the ritual needs to be defined.

---

### Bash's Character
**Who is Bash?**

Bash is the least developed of the five Lambda members. We know:
- Species: Wallaby
- Role: the translation function — holds two registers at once, the living connection between Songline nodes
- Wound: possibly a wallaby who tried to translate between two parties that refused translation and watched the conflict happen anyway
- Voice: unknown — does the translation instinct manifest as constantly reading the room? As speaking in other creatures' idioms? As pathological people-pleasing?
- Civilian life: undefined — working translator in some diminished capacity, or has given it up entirely?
- Chakra mapping: Ajna — the third eye, the perception that crosses between; Bash is the function that allows the network to route signal across community boundaries

What we don't have:
- Origin story (the ten-beat arc is unwritten)
- Personality and voice on the page
- What their Kappa Mu mission looks like in practice

**Why it's blocking:** Any chapter in Bash's POV is impossible without this. Bash appears in ensemble scenes with no interior life.

---

### The Non-Wombat Community Documents
**What do the other four societies actually look like at ground level?**

Each community needs a structural document. Currently:
- Dingo: partial (Pokero's files, animal_societies.md entry)
- Galah: partial (Cooroo's chapter, the Noble Noise)
- Emu: partial (Palar-Kuruswar lore, Merl's appearance)
- Wallaby: minimal — enriched by translator function but needs physical/social structure
- Koala: needs two documents — Canopy and Drop Bears separately

**Why it's blocking:** Each Lambda member's home-society mission requires a defined world to work within.

---

### Kappa Mu Class History
**What happened to the earlier classes?**

Lambda is the eleventh crossing. Ten cohorts crossed before them. We know Hangbat is Beta class. We don't know:
- Alpha class — the first crossing. Alive? Martyred? What did they do?
- What Beta class accomplished or attempted — essential for Hangbat's revelation scene to carry its full weight
- Whether any classes between Beta and Lambda are known to any character
- Whether any class was compromised, captured, or turned

**Why it's blocking:** Hangbat's Beta class revelation is a major story beat. Its weight requires knowing what Beta did and what it cost.

---

### The Drop Bears — Story Role
**What function do the feral Koalas serve in the narrative?**

Established: former healers, physically transformed by starvation, now feral predators in the dead eucalyptus canopy. But their story role is undefined:
- Purely antagonistic obstacles, or tragic figures with interiority?
- Named Drop Bear character?
- Is transformation reversible? (Can Arnam restoration return a Drop Bear to Canopy identity, or has the body changed past that point?)
- Relationship with the Static economy — do they guard pools inadvertently?
- Does the Kappa Mu mission include them, or are they a consequence only addressable after the root cause is fixed?

**Why it's blocking:** Any scene in or near the dead eucalyptus canopy requires knowing whether Drop Bears are present and what they can be.

---

### Book Two Structure — The Unravelling
**What are the specific beats of Book Two?**

The trilogy structure is confirmed (Book 2 ends with Node opening, Sovereigns' secrets revealed, Muskbat's break), but the internal sequence is undefined:
- What is the opening beat of Book Two? Where does Hoebat stand after the Sovereigns' embrace?
- At what point in Book Two does Muskbat publish the Jacaranda study?
- How does the Mnemo-Mu carrier who reads the study find the Songline match — what is that scene?
- What is the sequence: does the origin revelation come before or after the device project is discovered?
- Who else among the Sovereigns breaks, in what order? Does Vitabat break differently from Muskbat?
- What is the scene in which the Node actually opens — who is present, what does it look like?

**Why it's blocking:** Book Two cannot be drafted without a beat structure. The five-act mapping currently places it across late Act 3, Act 4, and the opening of Act 5 — but this is not yet specific enough to write from.

---

## Priority 2: World-Defining

*These gaps don't block immediate writing but shape the feel of the whole world.*

### The Device Project — Specifics
**How far along is the device, and when is it discovered?**

Established: Muskbat is rebuilding the crossing device from Static technology using Grout as frequency modulator, the Frequency architecture as signal broadcaster, and deep substrate measurements near the Node. The Jacaranda interferes with his measurements.

Undefined:
- What stage is the project at during Book One? During Book Two?
- Does any Lambda member stumble onto it before Muskbat's publication exposes it?
- When the Node opens at the end of Book Two — does the device play any role, or is it purely the wailing dance + faith that opens it?
- What happens to the device project when the Node opens? Does the open Node render it irrelevant, or does it become more dangerous?

---

### The Image+Song Pairs — How Are They Known?
**How does a wombat learn the rūpa+nāda for a specific Heart World?**

Established: Every Heart World has a unique image+song pair. You become the frequency of where you want to go. The Substrate Songline contains the resonance of the Sovereigns' origin world as the frequency they were carrying when they arrived.

Undefined:
- Are there Songlines that carry the pairs for specific worlds — can a Mnemo-Mu carrier hold a destination?
- Can you learn a pair from visiting a world (you bring it back in your body)?
- Can you learn a pair from someone who has been there?
- Is Hún Nico's own pair knowable from inside it, or only from outside?
- What happens if you hold an incomplete or inaccurate pair — do you arrive somewhere wrong, or do you fail to cross at all?

---

### The Timeline
**When did things happen, relative to each other?**

- When did the Static begin rising? How many generations ago?
- When did Kappa Mu Alpha first cross? Is Alpha ancient or recent?
- How long between crossings — seasons, years, decades? Lambda is the eleventh; if crossings are generational (20-30 years), Alpha crossed 200-300 years ago.
- Where in the timeline does the Silver Wattle's fall sit relative to Lambda's crossing?
- Where does Hangbat's exile sit? (He's been in the vault approximately 8 years — but when did Beta cross?)
- When did the Sovereigns arrive in Hún Nico, relative to the Static crisis's progression?

---

### Vitabat and Zuckbat — Full Profiles
**Less developed than Trumbat and Muskbat.**

- Vitabat (the Invisible Constant, the Zero Point) — his own voice, his tell, his version of the Imperial lie, and crucially: does he know what Muskbat is building? Does he know the full origin story? Is he the Sovereign most at peace with being stranded?
- Zuckbat (the Omniscient Censor) — personality, history, what he actually wants beyond order. He is the one who moves to bury Muskbat's data. What is his relationship to the truth he suppresses? Does he believe the lie, or does he simply find the lie functional?

---

### The Sovereigns' Origin World — What Is It Now?
**Does their home world still exist? Does anyone come from it?**

Established: The Sovereigns came from a more advanced but failing Heart World. The device they used is still there. Their home world has continued along the Static trajectory without them.

Undefined:
- Has the trajectory completed? Is the origin world now a dead world?
- Does the device still function?
- Has anyone from the origin world found Hún Nico's frequency and attempted the crossing in reverse? (Option D witness — the most dramatically surprising)
- What would the Sovereigns feel if someone arrived from their origin world? Recognition? Terror? The news they have been avoiding for generations?

---

### The Council's Relationship with the Dingo Packs
**How coerced vs. cooperative is the enforcement arrangement?**

- Do individual Dingoes choose this, or is it Pack-level coercion?
- Does the Council have leverage over Pack leadership beyond contract?
- What do the Packs get out of it beyond territory access and filtered Frequency?
- Is Pokero's position inside enforcement a personal arrangement or Pack-sanctioned?

---

### The Frequency Trade — Species Relationships
**The industrial grout cycle involves Dingoes, Koalas, and Kangaroos.**

- Dingoes harvest Static ore from Slop-Pits. Voluntary, coerced, or contracted?
- Koalas provide Lyptus resin. What is the Canopy's actual relationship with the Council?
- Kangaroos compress the ore through mob labour. Willing partners or under duress?
- What does each species think they're getting?

---

### Static Pools — History of Discovery
**Three possible framings — one needs to be chosen:**

- **Option A:** Always present, newly potent — pools existed long before the crisis; only when Arnam failed did their mimicry become addictive rather than interesting.
- **Option B:** Crisis discovery — pools appeared or became potent only as Static rose; a Kangaroo mob sheltering near one during drought experienced the sensation of fullness.
- **Option C:** Koala identification — Koalas, as healers, first mapped the pools' chemical properties and lost control of the information to Kangaroos.

The choice affects Koala prior claim, Kangaroo power origin, and how ancient the Static economy is.

---

### God-Kind Story Presence
**How do Humans appear in the narrative, if at all?**

The lore establishes Humans as geological forces — invisible, vast, radiating. But:
- Are they ever seen directly? By whom?
- The Yellow Monsters (excavators) fall forests. When does this happen and what does it mean to characters who witness it?
- Does any character understand the Human connection specifically, or are they always unknowable?
- Does the macro-cosmic theory require characters to *know* the mechanism, or can they act without understanding it?

---

### The Koala Canopy and Drop Bears — Internal Relationship
**What does it mean for Koala society that it has split?**

- Physical border between Canopy and Drop Bear territory?
- Do they ever interact, or is avoidance total?
- Does the Canopy accept moral responsibility for the Drop Bears?
- Are there Koalas who move between both worlds?
- Does any Drop Bear remember being a healer?

---

### Kangaroo Internal Politics
**Is the mob monolithic, or is there dissent?**

- Generational divide — older mobs remembering the guardian function?
- Mob leaders who resist the Council relationship?
- Does Kappa Mu need a specific Kangaroo ally? Which layer — matriarch with memory, or young mob member?
- What would it take for a mob to release a pool?

---

## Priority 3: Enrichment

*These gaps are interesting but don't affect the story's core integrity.*

### The Wallaby Translation Economy
Before the Static, every inter-species negotiation went through a wallaby. What did this look like in practice — formal or informal? Is there any remnant Bash could encounter, restore, or build on?

### The Drop Bears — Physical Description
What do they actually look like? Visibly different from Canopy Koalas — changed claws, size, fur? Or almost identical until they move, until they drop? The Jennings grotesque potential: the thing that looks like a healer until it doesn't.

### The Other Kappa Mu Classes — Personalities
What are Gamma through Kappa doing? One or two defined classes would give the movement depth — cautionary tales, mysterious allies, infrastructure Lambda doesn't know it's running on.

### The Rosella Parliament — Current State
The Fragment Prophets carry pieces of the Songline network index. Remaining questions:
- Is any Rosella trying to reconstruct the Parliament?
- Does any Fragment Prophet know that what they carry is network architecture rather than prophecy?
- Could the Fragment Prophets, brought together, reconstruct enough of the index to guide restoration?

### The Platypus Ghost Network — Active Role
The Platypus maintain the pipes the Council has abandoned. Do they ever make contact with Lambda? Is there a moment where their invisible work becomes visible?

### The Dog-Brahman — Who Are They?
The solitary anchor-point figure. Named character? Location? Knowledge of Kappa Mu?

### The Lolaboo Thread
Hoebat's mate. Introduced in Chapter 3. Does she become active in the mission, or does she represent the civilian world he is trying to protect?

### What Happens to Barnabat
Hoebat sees him once in a foreman's vest and Barnabat doesn't look back. Does he reappear? Is a reckoning required, or is he meant to remain a symbol of the choice not taken?

### The Wall — Its Actual Progress
Where is the Wall in the story's present? Nearly complete? Stalled? Has the Liquefaction Event damage begun? The Jacaranda's lateral roots undermining the foundation is established — is this visible to any character yet?

### Sydborow
A file exists (`raw/locations/sydborow.md`) not yet integrated. Sister civilization? Former colony? Relationship to Melborow and the five-Borow system?

### The Three Grades of Static — Lived Reality
How does the Static economy actually feel from inside?
- What does refined Static look, smell, feel like physically?
- Who has access to what grade?
- What does visible addiction look like?
- How does a Lyptus deal happen?

### The Mnemo-Mu Carriers — Who Are They?
At least one named Mnemo-Mu carrier should cross under the Jacaranda and briefly read the full network map before losing it again. Who is this character? Where are they encountered? Are they the same carrier who later matches Muskbat's spectral data to a Songline fragment?

---

## Standing Inconsistencies to Resolve

### The Kappa Mu Oath Scene
Chapter 3 references the Root Chamber oath. The v1 of Chapter 4 ends with the seed being planted and Cooroo passing out — before any oath scene. The narrative sequence of Cooroo arriving at the Jacaranda → vision → Cooroo finding the others → the Crossing needs to be plotted explicitly so chapter numbering and POV switching is consistent.

### Lambda's Crossing Timing
When exactly did Lambda cross, relative to the chapters we have? Chapter 3 (Melborow Frequency) shows Hoebat after the Crossing — he references the Kappa Mu as existing. Chapter 4 (Wombat's Descent) shows the origin leading up to the Gorge/Cooroo encounter. Is the Crossing between Chapter 4 and Chapter 3, or is Chapter 3 a flashback structure?

### See-Also References in Older Files
Several older files still use the pre-reorganisation file paths (e.g., `raw/meta/the_jacaranda_agenda.md` instead of `02-movement/jacaranda-agenda.md`). These reference paths should be updated when those files are next touched.
