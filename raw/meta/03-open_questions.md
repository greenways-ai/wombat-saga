# Open Questions: What Needs to Be Decided

*Organised by priority. Story-blocking questions must be answered before those scenes can be written. World-defining questions shape the feel of the whole. Enrichment questions can wait.*

---

## Priority 1: Story-Blocking

*These gaps prevent specific scenes or chapters from being written.*

### The Crossing Ceremony
**What does it actually look like?**
We know the Jacaranda "reads" the creature and that the standing-together under the roots constitutes the oath. But the ritual itself is unwritten.
- Who crosses first — does order matter?
- Is there a spoken element, or is it entirely felt/vibrational?
- Does the tree do something visible, or is the experience entirely internal?
- How long does it take?
- What does a creature feel afterward that they didn't feel before?
- Are all five present simultaneously, or do they arrive separately and the Crossing only completes when all five have stood beneath the roots?

**Why it's blocking:** The Root Chamber scene in Chapter 3 references the Crossing but doesn't dramatize it. If this scene is to be a chapter in its own right, the ritual needs to be defined.

---

### Bash's Character
**Who is Bash?**
Bash is the least developed of the five Lambda members. We know:
- Species: Wallaby
- Role: carries the squad's pain / Resonance Link
- The field between squad members is tight enough that Hoebat breaking ribs is felt by Bash three kilometres away
- Name suggests something percussive or blunt

What we don't know:
- Origin story (the five-beat arc is unwritten)
- Wound / what broke them open to Kappa Mu
- Voice and personality
- What their civilian life looks like in Wallaby society
- What specifically is wrong in Wallaby civilization that they are working to repair

**Why it's blocking:** Bash appears in ensemble scenes but has no interior life on the page yet. Any chapter in Bash's POV is impossible without this.

---

### The Non-Wombat Civilization Documents
**What do the other four societies actually look like?**

The Dingo Pack civilization, Galah/Avian civilization, Emu civilization, and Wallaby civilization each need a structural document equivalent to `the_five_borow_societies.md`. Currently:
- Dingo: partial (Pokero's files, the Westside Connect song, the animal_societies.md entry)
- Galah: partial (Cooroo's chapter, the Morning Glory story, the Rosella choir file)
- Emu: partial (Palar-Kuruswar lore, Merl's chapter appearance)
- Wallaby: minimal (animal_societies.md entry, Bash appearances)

**Why it's blocking:** Each Lambda member's home-society mission thread requires a defined world to work within.

---

### The Known Kappa Mu Class History
**What happened to the earlier classes?**

Lambda is the eleventh crossing. Ten cohorts crossed before them. We know Hangbat is Beta class. We know nothing about:
- Alpha class — the first crossing. Are they alive? Martyred? Their work?
- What Beta class (Hangbat's cohort) accomplished or attempted
- Whether any classes between Beta and Lambda are known to any character
- Whether any class was compromised, captured, or turned

**Why it's blocking:** Hangbat's revelation (that he is Beta class) is a major story beat. Its full weight requires knowing what Beta class did, what it cost, and why Hangbat has been in the drainage vault for eight years rather than active in the movement.

---

### The Endgame
**What does restoration actually look like?**

The macro-cosmic theory states that enough restored Arnam-flow in the animal world will soften the human substrate and break the Static loop. But:
- What is the threshold? One civilization restored, or all five?
- Is there a specific event — something the Kappa Mu does — that triggers the shift, or is it a slow accumulation?
- What happens to Melborow and the Council when Arnam-flow returns? Does the Tally dissolve? Do the Sovereigns fall? Or does restoration coexist with the Imperial system?
- What does the Fractal Rainforest look like at full expression — is it the literal future landscape of Hún Nico, or a metaphor for the restored social world?

**Why it's blocking:** Without a defined endgame, the saga's narrative arc cannot be shaped. Every chapter's stakes depend on knowing what winning looks like.

## Priority 2: World-Defining

*These gaps don't block immediate writing but shape the feel of the whole world.*

### The Timeline
**When did things happen, relative to each other?**

- When did the Static begin rising? (How many generations ago?)
- When did Kappa Mu Alpha first cross? Is Alpha ancient, or relatively recent?
- How long between crossings — seasons, years, decades?
- Lambda = 11th crossing. If crossings are roughly generational (20-30 years), Alpha crossed 200-330 years ago. If annual, Alpha crossed 10 years ago. This changes everything.
- Where in the timeline does the Silver Wattle's fall sit relative to Lambda's crossing?
- Where does Hangbat's exile sit? (He's been in the drainage vault approximately 8 years — but when did Beta cross?)

---

### Vitabat and Zuckbat — Full Profiles
**Less developed than Trumbat and Muskbat.**

Vitabat is defined primarily through Muskbat's description of him ("the Invisible Constant," "the Zero Point"). His own voice, his own tell, his own version of the Imperial lie — these are underwritten.

Zuckbat is the most shadowy Sovereign. We have his function (the Censorate, the Archive, Tally-stone surveillance) but not his personality, his history, or what he actually wants beyond order.

---

### The Council's Relationship with the Dingo Packs
**How coerced vs. cooperative is this arrangement?**

The Dingo Packs do enforcement work in wombat territory. But:
- Do individual Dingoes choose this, or is it Pack-level coercion?
- Does the Council have leverage over Pack leadership? What kind?
- Is Pokero's relationship with Bronxborow enforcement a personal arrangement or a Pack sanctioned one?
- What do the Packs get out of it beyond territory access and filtered Frequency?

---

### The Frequency Trade — Species Relationships
**The industrial grout cycle involves Dingoes, Koalas, and Kangaroos.**

- Dingoes harvest Static ore from Slop-Pits. Is this voluntary, coerced, or some version of Pack contract?
- Koalas provide Lyptus resin as binders. What is the Koala Canopy's actual relationship with the Council?
- Kangaroos run the Friction Engine for compression. Are the mob leaders willing partners or under duress?
- These relationships give the Council reach into three non-wombat civilizations. What does each species think they're getting?

---

### The God-Kind (Humans) — Story Presence
**How do Humans appear in the narrative?**

The lore establishes Humans as Lovecraftian forces — geological disasters, cold and invisible. But:
- Are they ever seen directly? If so, by whom, and what does that scene look like?
- The Yellow Monsters (excavators) fall forests. When does this happen in the story, and what does it mean to the characters who witness it?
- Is there any moment where a character understands the Human world with any specificity — or are they always unknowable?
- Does the macro-cosmic theory require the characters to *know* about the Human connection, or can they act on it without fully understanding the mechanism?

---

### The Closing Node
**What is it, exactly?**

The Closing Node appears in Statborow's deepest level, in Hangbat's "Loop Logic" heresy, and in the Coring Tree lore (the fold at the bottom of the heart-shaped world). But:
- Is it a physical location that characters can visit and interact with?
- Is it the place where inter-world root bridges used to connect to adjacent Heart-Worlds?
- If the Coring Trees once punched through the Closing Node into adjacent worlds, and those trees are now dead — is the Node sealed, damaged, or still open in some vestigial way?
- Does Kappa Mu's mission have anything to do with the Closing Node, or is it tangential?

---

### Sydborow
**What is it and how does it relate?**

A file exists (`raw/locations/sydborow.md`) that has not been integrated into the current structural understanding. Is Sydborow another wombat city? A sister civilization? A former colony? Its relationship to Melborow and to the five-Borow system needs clarification.

---

## Priority 3: Enrichment

*These gaps are interesting but don't affect the story's core integrity.*

### The Other Kappa Mu Classes — Personalities
What are Gamma through Kappa doing? Do any of them surface in the story as mysterious allies, as cautionary tales, or as the infrastructure Lambda doesn't know they're running on? Even one or two defined classes would give the movement depth.

### The Rosella Parliament — Current State
We know it shattered when the Silver Wattle fell. But what does the scattered Rosella world look like now? Are the Fragment Prophets in contact with each other? Is any Rosella trying to reconstruct the Parliament?

### The Platypus Ghost Network — Active Role
The Platypus are maintaining the pipes the Council has abandoned. Do they ever make contact with any Lambda member? Is there a moment where their invisible work becomes visible?

### The Dog-Brahman — Who Are They?
The Non-Society entry in animal_societies.md describes a solitary anchor-point figure. Is there a specific Dog-Brahman character? Where do they sit? Do they know about Kappa Mu?

### The Lolaboo Thread
Hoebat's mate. Introduced in Chapter 3, shown leaving the BorowFinder behind and finding a burrow in the Canopy Remnant. What is her role in the ongoing story? Does she become active in the mission, or does she represent the civilian world Hoebat is trying to protect?

### The Song of the Soil / Songlines
The ancient oral record that Tally-stones replaced. Does any of it survive? Is there a character who carries it? Could its recovery be a story beat?

### What Happens to Barnabat
Hoebat sees him once, in a foreman's vest, and Barnabat doesn't look back. Does he reappear? Does the story require a reckoning between them, or is he meant to remain a symbol of the choice not taken?

### The Wall — Its Actual Progress
The Great Retaining Wall is Trumbat's vanity project and the Corvée machine's justification. Where is it in the story's present? Is it nearly complete? Stalled? Has it caused the geological damage (Liquefaction Event prevention vs. earth unable to breathe) that the lore suggests?

## Standing Inconsistencies to Resolve

### "Trum-Bat" vs "Trumbat"
The name appears hyphenated in some documents and unhyphenated in others. Pick one and apply consistently. (Recommendation: **Trumbat**, matching the antagonists document.)

### The Kappa Mu Oath Scene
Chapter 3 references the Root Chamber oath. The v1 of Chapter 4 ends with the seed being planted and Cooroo passing out — before any oath scene. The narrative sequence of: Cooroo arrives at Jacaranda → vision → Cooroo finds the others → the Crossing — needs to be plotted explicitly so that chapter numbering and POV switching is consistent.

### Lambda's Crossing Timing
When exactly did Lambda cross, relative to the chapters we have? Chapter 3 (Melborow Frequency) appears to show Hoebat *after* the crossing — he references the Kappa Mu as existing. Chapter 4 (Wombat's Descent) shows the origin leading *up to* the Gorge/Cooroo encounter. Is the Crossing between Chapter 4 and Chapter 3, or is Chapter 3 a flashback structure?
