# Option 2 (Revised): The Prophet's Awakening (Cooroo's Divine Conversation)

## I. The Narrative Frame

**The Central Conflict:** **Noise vs. Signal.**
The Sovereigns control the "Frequency" (Muskbat's broadcast of distraction). Cooroo seeks the "Noble Noise" (The true voice of the land).

**The Theme:** **The Return of Color.**
Cooroo is the "Seer" who perceives the world in full spectrum while Melborow has faded to grey. His journey is to bring the "Violet Frequency" (Jacaranda) back to the sky.

**The Arc of Cooroo:**
1.  **The Cynic Phase (Status Quo):** Cooroo is a "Galah-Prophet" who has stopped screaming because no one listens. He floats above the smog, cynical about the "Grey World."
2.  **The Divine Conversation (Inciting Incident):** He is woken by a **Morning Glory** flower—a weed considered "illegal flora" by the Council. It speaks to him not in words, but in color.
3.  **The Directive:** The flower tells him that the "Purple" is not gone; it has just moved underground. He must find the **Great Jacaranda**.
4.  **The Descent:** To find the sky-tree (Jacaranda), the bird of the air must do the impossible: go underground into the Wombat tunnels.

## II. The Entry Point: "The Trumpet in the Smog"

**Setting:** The **High-Wire Roost**, atop a decommissioned power line overlooking the smog-layer of Melborow. Dawn is breaking, but the sun looks like a bruised peach behind the pollution.

### Chapter 1: The Weed on the Wire

Cooroo adjusted his grip on the high-tension cable. The wind up here usually smelled of ozone and burnt plastic—the signature scent of the Muskbat Frequency towers humming below, which worked by saturating the atmosphere with exactly enough noise to prevent anyone from having a private thought. But this morning, the wind carried something else.

It carried a question.

*Are you still pink?*

Cooroo fluffed his chest feathers. "I'm grey," he muttered to the smog. "Grey like the grout. Grey like the sky. Pink is a liability in this economy."

He was a Galah of the **Old School**. He remembered when the sky was blue, not "Data-Haze Cyan"—a color that looked like it had been chosen by a committee that had never actually seen the sky but had read a very thorough report on it. He remembered when noise was something you made to celebrate the rain, not something you bought to drown out your own heartbeat. Now, he just sat on the wire, watching the "Yellow Monsters" (excavators) carve up the horizon, waiting for the world to finally turn completely black and white.

He was about to tuck his head under his wing—which was, in his opinion, the only reasonable response to a Tuesday—when he saw it.

It was growing out of a crack in the ceramic insulator of the power pole. A single, defiant vine. And at the end of the vine, unfurling in the toxic air like a flag of rebellion, was a flower.

A **Morning Glory**.

It was blue. Not the pale, apologetic blue of the Dingo-Light LED screens. It was a deep, impossible, vibrating *indigo*.

Cooroo hopped closer, his claws clicking on the ceramic. "You're illegal," he told the flower. "Section 44 of the Vegetation Act. 'No non-sanctioned photosynthesis above the Grout Line.' You're supposed to be a data-point, not a plant."

The flower didn't wither. It opened wider. And as the first ray of the bruised sun hit its petals, the flower *spoke*.

It didn't use words. Galahs don't speak English; they speak **Volume**. And the Morning Glory was screaming in a frequency that only a Galah could hear—a trumpet blast of pure color that resonated directly in Cooroo's syrinx. It was a frequency modulation that bypassed his cynicism and landed straight in his gut.

*The Root is thirsty, Sky-Bird,* the Indigo screamed.

Cooroo recoiled, nearly falling off the wire. "The Root? What Root? The Wattle is dead. The Primes are gone. There are no roots left, only fiber-optic cables."

The Morning Glory twisted its vine, pointing down. Straight down. Through the smog. Through the pavement. Through the miles of Safety Grout. Its leaves were angled at precisely forty-five degrees, a biological vector pointing toward the deep substrate.

*The Wattle is dead,* the flower agreed, its petals vibrating with a chromatic intensity. *But the Jacaranda is waking up.*

"Jacaranda?" Cooroo laughed, a harsh, screeching sound that felt like sandpaper on silk. "That's a myth. A nursery rhyme for joeys. The 'Purple Rain' is just a rendering error in the old lore."

*I am here,* the flower pulsed. *I am the scout. I am the first note of the trumpet. If you want the rest of the song, you have to find the conductor.*

"And where is the conductor?"

The flower pointed down again. *In the dark. In the dirt. Where the birds don't go.*

Cooroo looked at the smog. He looked at his grey feathers. Then he looked at the Indigo flower, vibrating with a life that terrified him because it was so much louder than the silence.

"You want me... a creature of the air... to go into the *tunnel*?"

*The sky is broken, Cooroo,* the flower said. *The only way to fix the sky is to fix the ground. Go find the Architect. Go find the Wombat who holds the trowel.*

The flower began to wilt, its energy spent in the delivery of the message. The indigo faded to a dull purple, then to brown—a rapid cellular collapse that left nothing but a husk.

Cooroo stood alone on the wire. The message was delivered.

He could ignore it. He could stay up here, safe in his cynicism, watching the world turn grey. He could wait for the final calcification to claim his feathers.

Or he could dive.

Cooroo spread his wings. The pink under his wings—hidden for years, a dusty, rose-colored secret—flashed in the morning light.

"Fine," he screeched at the dead flower. "But if I get dirt in my beak, I'm billing you."

He tucked his wings and dropped like a stone—a maneuver that was ten percent aerodynamics and ninety percent pure, unadulterated gravity.

### III. Why This Works

1.  **It Expands the Lore:** It introduces the "Plant Intelligence" network (The Flora talking to the Fauna).
2.  **It Inverts the Archetype:** The Bird (Sky) is forced to go Underground (Earth), creating immediate tension.
3.  **It Connects the Threads:** The flower explicitly links Cooroo to Hoebat ("The Wombat who holds the trowel").
4.  **It Establishes the Tone:** It blends the mystical (talking flowers) with the cynical (Cooroo's world-weary attitude), balancing Rowling's warmth with Asimov's systemic precision.
