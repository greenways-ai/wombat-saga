# Author Tonal Guide: The 80/20 Weaver (Rowling-Asimov Hybrid)

This document codifies the specific narrative voice established in the Wombat Saga, specifically as seen in *The Morning Glory*. It is designed to balance deep, wry empathy with clinical, structural precision.

## I. The Fundamental Ratio: 80% Rowling / 20% Asimov

### 1. The Rowling Component (The Narrative "Wet-Code")
**Goal:** To provide warmth, character interiority, and a sense of shared history.

*   **Wry Observation:** The narrator should sound like they have lived in Arnamland for centuries and find everyone's behavior—especially the Galahs—predictably ridiculous but deeply endearing.
    *   *Example:* "Galahs screamed. It was what they did... they screamed the way rivers flowed, which is to say constantly, without apology, and often at four in the morning."
*   **Emotive Metaphor:** Use analogies that ground complex feelings in common, sensory experiences.
    *   *Example:* "A noise that was to a proper scream what a candle is to a bonfire."
*   **Species Archetypes:** Treat species behaviors as personality traits or "vocation-pathologies." Wombats don't just dig; they dig *pathologically*.
    *   *Example:* "...wombats were welcome to it; they liked counting things the way Galahs liked screaming."
*   **Close Focalization:** The narrative stays very close to the protagonist’s physical sensations (feathers, claws, crests) and emotional state (stubbornness, grief, confusion).

### 2. The Asimov Component (The Narrative "Dry-Logic")
**Goal:** To provide structural integrity, forensic detail, and a sense of systemic mechanism.

*   **Mechanical Precision:** Briefly step back to explain the *how* of a biological or physical process using technical terminology.
    *   *Example:* "...the machinery was there—he could feel it working, the syrinx contracting, the air flowing, the resonating chambers in his skull doing their level best."
*   **Structural Categorization:** Use the language of an auditor or a technician to describe the environment. This represents the "Static" or "Council" perspective overlaying the natural world.
    *   *Example:* "The operator had filed the remains under 'Site Prep: Day 1' and gone home for tea."
*   **Geometric Description:** When describing the "Static" or the "Bad Ground," use cold, geometric terms to contrast with the organic "Rowling" descriptions of the birds.
    *   *Example:* "Hexagons, interlocking, repeating, marching down the slope in rows so regular they looked deliberate."
*   **Systemic Consequences:** State the logic of a situation as a design specification or a systems failure.
    *   *Example:* "Cooriki was describing a systems failure as precisely as any technician could."

## II. Stylistic Fingerprints

### 1. The "Rule of Three" Descriptions
When introducing a group or a concept, list three things—two recognizable behaviors and one wry philosophical or technical conclusion.
*   *Template:* "[Species A] did X, [Species B] did Y, but [Species C] did Z, which was less of a choice and more of a design flaw."

### 2. Parenthetical Asides
Use dashes to insert small, sharp observations that provide context or humor.
*   *Example:* "...which was, as far as anyone in the colony could recall, a thing that had never happened to a Galah before..."

### 3. The "Inversion" Metaphor
Take a large, cosmic event and compare it to a small, domestic inconvenience.
*   *Example:* "Two hundred years of tree had fallen in stages, the way giants fall: disbelief, lean, surrender... The operator filed it under 'Site Prep'."

### 4. Tonal Transition (The "Hard-Cut")
Transition from a warm, emotional moment directly into a cold, clinical observation to highlight the "Great Disconnection."
*   *Example:* "Cooroo felt the memory of the tree’s warmth. (Rowling) The rings were visible on the cut face, representing 200 cycles of structural data. (Asimov)"

## III. Vocabulary Palette

*   **Rowling Keywords:**Temerity, contradiction, stubbornness, companionable, endearing, ridiculous, heartwood, soul, ancient.
*   **Asimov Keywords:**Substrate, hexagonal, lattice, specification, resonance chambers, data-haze, site prep, mechanism, frequency, geometric, parameters.

## IV. The "Maha Tahto" Balance
Always ensure that the **Asimov 20%** doesn't take over. It should feel like a "Forensic Seal" applied over a "Wet Story." The technical details should make the world feel *heavier* and *more real*, not colder or more distant. You are explaining the clockwork because the clockwork is currently breaking the protagonist's heart.
