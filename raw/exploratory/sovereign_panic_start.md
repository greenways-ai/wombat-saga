# Option 6: The Moisture Report (The Sovereign Panic)

## I. The Narrative Frame

**The Central Conflict:** **Control vs. Chaos.**
The Sovereigns believe they are gods. The return of the "Wet-Logic" (Arnam) threatens to dissolve their artificial world. They are not fighting an army; they are fighting a *chemistry*.

**The Theme:** **The fragility of the Lie.**
The more rigid the system (The Static), the more vulnerable it is to a single point of failure (The Crack).

**The Subjects: The Five-I's Inner Circle**
*   **Trumbat (Priest):** Denial. "It's fake news."
*   **Vitabat (Enforcer):** Aggression. "Kill it."
*   **Zuckbat (The Tally):** Analysis. "The math says it's already too late."

## II. The Entry Point: "Protocol Grey"

**Setting:** **The Cathedral Boardroom**. A room made entirely of polished "Obsidian-Glass" (screens). It overlooks the "Glow Room."

### Chapter 1: 0.01%

The room was silent, except for the hum of the servers managing the **Tally**.

Zuckbat sat at the head of the table. He didn't look like a Wombat anymore; he looked like a hoodie filled with shadows. He slid a single sheet of digital paper across the obsidian table. The table surface was so perfectly polished it reflected the ceiling, the floor, and the emptiness of the souls sitting around it.

"Read it," he whispered. His voice sounded like dry leaves skittering on pavement—a sound that usually meant autumn, but here meant an audit.

Trumbat picked it up, adjusting his golden mitre. "I don't read negative reports, Zuck. It disrupts my manifestation. The Golden Vessel requires positive inputs."

"Read it," Vitabat snarled, snatching the paper. He was wearing an Italian suit that cost more than the GDP of Sector 4, and he wore it with the casual violence of someone who knows the tailor is afraid to ask for payment.

Vitabat scanned the data. His eyes narrowed. The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees. The condensation on the water pitcher froze instantly. The Inverse Koala Instinct—thermodynamic negation.

"Sector 7-Deep," Vitabat read. "Moisture levels at 14%. Structural integrity at 99.98%."

"So?" Trumbat laughed, waving a paw. "It's a leak. Send a plumber. Send a drone. Why are we having an emergency meeting for a damp spot? The Grout will hold. The Grout always holds."

"It's not a leak," Zuckbat said. He tapped the table, and a hologram materialized in the center of the room. It showed a 3D scan of the retaining wall in Sector 7—a grid of perfect grey squares.

Except for one.

A single, purple line was traced through the grey.

"It's a root," Zuckbat said.

The room went deadly silent.

"That's impossible," Trumbat whispered, his golden aura flickering. "We paved the Wattle. We poisoned the aquifer. We deleted the word 'Green' from the dictionary."

"It's not a Wattle root," Zuckbat said. "The DNA scan is... foreign. It is categorized as *Jacaranda mimosifolia*. The weed. The invader."

Vitabat stood up. He walked to the window and looked down at the city he owned. The lights of the Glow Room twinkled below—a galaxy of manufactured stars for creatures who had forgotten the real ones.

"It gets worse," Zuckbat continued. "The root is emitting a frequency. It's not the Muskbat Broadcast. It's... a counter-signal. It's harmonizing with the Galahs. It's vibrating the Grout at 432 Hertz. And..."

He paused, looking at his two co-conspirators.

"...it's asking a question."

"Plants don't ask questions!" Trumbat shouted, slamming his fist on the table. "Plants are content! Plants are mute! That is the agreement!"

"This one does," Zuckbat said. "The algorithm decoded the vibration pattern. The root is asking: *Are you servicing the land?*"

Vitabat turned from the window. His face was a mask of cold, Imperial violence.

"Authorize **Protocol Grey**," Vitabat said.

"That will collapse Sector 7," Zuckbat warned. "Thousands of Diggers will be crushed. The loss of labor capital would be... statistically significant."

"They are assets," Vitabat said. "Assets depreciate. But if that root connects to the Aquifer... if the water starts flowing again... we lose the **Tally**. We lose the **Tally-Debt**. We lose everything."

He looked at the hologram of the purple line.

"Pour the concrete," Vitabat ordered. "Bury it. And bury anyone who has seen it."

### III. Why This Works

1.  **It Raises the Stakes:** Hoebat isn't just fixing a crack; he is standing in the blast zone of "Protocol Grey."
2.  **It Shows the Fear:** The Sovereigns are terrified of the "Question." It proves that their power is fragile.
3.  **It Establishes the Timeline:** A "ticking clock" is started. The concrete is coming.
