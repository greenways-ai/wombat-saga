# The Crimson Frequency (Hoebat and the Rosellas)

*The crack in the Echo Chamber wasn't vertical or horizontal. It was diagonal, jagged, and it hummed.*

---

Hoebat slapped another layer of wet clay over the fissure. He smoothed it with his trowel, pressing the dense, grounding earth into the wound of the wall.

"Stay," he muttered. "Hold. Be a wall."

The clay held for three seconds. Then, a low vibration shuddered through the stone—a sound like a cello string snapping in slow motion. The clay cracked. The fissure spat out a puff of dust, mocking him.

"You can't patch a scream with mud, darling," a voice trilled from above.

Hoebat looked up. Perched on a protruding root-knee was a bird that hurt to look at.

It was a **Crimson Rosella**, its feathers a riot of red and azure that seemed to vibrate against the dreary brown of the tunnel. It looked less like a bird and more like a hole in reality where the color was leaking through.

"I'm busy," Hoebat grunted, scraping the failed patch off the wall. "Go sing somewhere else. Ideally, somewhere with soft surfaces."

"But this is where the song is needed!" the Rosella chirped, hopping closer. "The wall is crying. Can't you hear it? It's singing a G-Sharp, but it wants to be an A-Flat."

"It's the same note," Hoebat said, mixing more straw into his clay. "And walls don't sing. They stand. Or in this case, they fall."

"Oh, you square little ground-potato," the bird sighed, fluffing its chest. "G-Sharp is anxiety! A-Flat is resolution! It's all about the approach! You're trying to fix a frequency problem with mass. It's like trying to catch a sunbeam with a shovel."

Hoebat ignored it. He was a **Dust-Bearer**. He believed in mass. He believed in load-bearing structures. He slapped a thicker layer of clay onto the crack.

*CRACK.*

The vibration was louder this time. A chunk of rock dislodged from the ceiling and shattered near Hoebat's paw.

"See?" the Rosella said. "The wall is rejecting your premise. It's insulted."

"What do you want it to do?" Hoebat snapped, wiping mud from his eyes. "Apologize?"

"I want it to harmonize!"

The Rosella let out a whistle—a sharp, piercing sound that made Hoebat's teeth ache. Suddenly, the tunnel was filled with wings. Twelve more Rosellas descended from the ventilation shaft, a swirling vortex of crimson, blue, and yellow. They landed on the roots, the rocks, the very edge of Hoebat's bucket.

"Girls!" the first Rosella announced. "We have a dissonant interval in Sector 4! The wombat is trying to mute it! We need a **Solution in Red**!"

"Red is too aggressive!" another bird argued. "It needs a Cooling Blue! The rock is hot with anger!"

"No! Blue is too sad! It will just sag! We need a **Purple Resolution**! Tension into Dignity!"

The birds began to sing.

It wasn't a song Hoebat recognized. It wasn't the rhythmic chanting of the Dust-Bearers or the smooth, hypnotic hum of the **Muskbat Frequency**. It was chaotic. It was loud. It was a dozen different melodies fighting for dominance in a confined space.

Hoebat covered his ears. "Stop! You're making it worse! The vibration will bring the roof down!"

"We're finding the node!" the leader screamed over the cacophony. "Keep going! Turn the dissonance into a braid!"

And then, something impossible happened.

The chaos... snapped.

The twelve different songs didn't stop, but they aligned. The screeching highs and the guttural lows suddenly locked into a complex, shimmering chord. It was a sound Hoebat could feel in his bones—not a weight, but a lift.

The vibration in the wall changed. The hum of the crack shifted from a jagged buzz to a smooth, resonant purr.

"Now!" the leader commanded. "Quickly! While the tension is suspended!"

She looked at Hoebat. "Put the clay in now, you stubborn brick! The wound is open! Fill it with gold!"

Hoebat didn't argue. He felt the change in the stone. The pressure was gone. The wall felt... light.

He slapped the clay into the fissure. It didn't crack. It settled. It bonded with the stone as if the rock itself was hungry for it.

The Rosellas held the note for a full minute, their chests puffing, their colors blazing in the dim light. Then, one by one, they dropped out of the harmony, leaving only the leader holding a single, pure, high note that faded into silence.

The patch held.

Hoebat touched the dry clay. It was solid.

"What did you do?" he whispered.

"We gave the anger somewhere to go," the Rosella said, preening a wing feather. "Structure isn't just about strength, darling. It's about agreement. The rock was fighting itself. We just... introduced it to a better argument."

She flew down and landed on Hoebat's head. He was too stunned to swat her away.

"You diggers," she said softly. "You think you can bury everything. But some things have to be sung out."

Hoebat looked at the wall. For the first time, he didn't just see a barrier. He saw a frozen song.

"Can you teach me that?" he asked.

The Rosella laughed, a sound like wind chimes in a storm.

"Teach a wombat to sing? Oh, honey. We don't have enough lifetimes. But..." She leaned down and pecked him gently on the ear. "Be careful with that shovel. Sometimes, the heaviest thing you carry isn't the dirt. It's the silence."

With a flash of red, she was gone, leading her choir back up the shaft to yell at a cloud that was shaping itself incorrectly.

Hoebat stood alone in the quiet tunnel. He picked up his trowel. He didn't just slap the next patch on. He hummed a low, rumble of a note—a G-Sharp, he thought—and pressed the earth into place with a little more listener's grace.
