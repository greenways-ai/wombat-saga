## I. The Fiveways (04:00)

The tunnels still curved in those days.

Not the polite, engineered curves of a drainage system — real curves, the kind the earth made when it was still allowed to have opinions. The walls leaned into each other like old friends sharing a secret, and the ceiling arched overhead in a shape that had no name in geometry but which every wombat's spine recognised as *correct*. You could press your shoulder against the wall and feel it give, just slightly, just enough to remind you that the ground was alive and you were inside it and it was holding you the way a mother holds a joey — not tightly, but completely.

Hoebat arrived at the Fiveways first because Hoebat always arrived first. Not out of eagerness — out of a compulsion he didn't yet understand and wouldn't name for years. He liked to stand in the junction alone, in the dark, before the others came and filled it with noise. He liked to put his paw against the wall where five tunnels converged into a natural amphitheatre — a fluke of geology that had produced a chamber roughly the shape and size of a wombat's chest cavity — and feel the air move.

The air was wet. It was always wet then. Not the aggressive wet of rain but the ambient wet of a world that still remembered how to hold moisture — a dampness that lived in the walls and the floor and the space between your fur and your skin. You breathed it in and your lungs softened. You breathed it out and the walls drank it back. A conversation.

Hoebat was twelve. He was not yet a grifter. He was not yet an architect. He was not yet a shadow who repaired ceilings at midnight while a city slept above him in the ignorance he provided. He was a kid who had run out of his father's borow three hours ago because Cornelibat had demanded he count the roots in the North Wall again, and who had no intention of going back until the roots agreed to stop moving.

The first sound was Scribat.

You always heard Scribat before you saw him, because Scribat's mouth arrived several seconds ahead of his body, like a scout sent to prepare the terrain for the main invasion.

"—and I'm telling you, the shortcut through the Wet Bend saves you forty paces if you hug the left wall, but if you go right you hit the drip-zone and the floor's slick and you'll slide straight into Old Merrow's pantry and she will *end* you, she threw a turnip at my head last week and her aim is—"

"Scribat." Hoebat didn't raise his voice. He never raised his voice. Even at twelve, he had the quality that would later make him the most effective con-wombat in the Gray Grotto and, later still, the most effective engineer — the ability to say a single word at exactly the volume that made you stop talking and listen.

Scribat materialised from Tunnel Three, still talking, his paws stained with charcoal. He was a lean, fidgety wombat with eyes that moved faster than his feet and feet that moved faster than his common sense. The walls of every tunnel within a kilometre of the Fiveways bore his work — maps drawn in charcoal on wet clay, intricate networks of lines and arrows and annotations that were either the most detailed survey of Melborow's outer ring ever produced or the ravings of a creature with an unhealthy relationship to cartography. Probably both.

"I mapped the new route," Scribat said, holding up his paws as evidence. "Through the Root Cathedral, under the seep-bed, out through the vent-crack near the back margins. Eighteen minutes. Maybe fifteen if Flickbat does the squeeze section."

"Flickbat isn't here yet."

"Flickbat is always here," said Flickbat, from somewhere above them.

They looked up. She was wedged into a gap between the ceiling and the wall — a space roughly the width of a wombat's skull, into which she had somehow inserted her entire body. She hung there like a bat, or a spider, or a very small creature who had been told repeatedly that the laws of physics applied to her and had decided she disagreed.

"How long have you been up there?" Hoebat asked.

"Since before you got here. I watched you put your paw on the wall and stand there like a weirdo for five minutes."

"I was listening."

"To what?"

Hoebat didn't answer, because he didn't know. The wall hummed sometimes, or he thought it did, or he wanted it to — a low vibration that lived below hearing and above imagination, like the memory of a sound that hadn't been made yet. He had tried to explain it to his father once. Cornelibat had told him to take an antacid.

The ground shook. Not an earthquake — a footstep. A very large footstep, followed by another, followed by a rhythmic pattern that made the loose clay on the floor dance.

Duzbat arrived the way Duzbat did everything: with his full weight, applied deliberately, to see what would happen. He was the biggest wombat in the outer ring by a margin that other wombats found uncomfortable. His shoulders filled the tunnel mouth of Tunnel Two so completely that he had to angle himself sideways to enter, and even then the walls complained. His claws were massive — not long, but thick, like chisels carved from stone, and they were perpetually caked with clay from digging that went deeper and lasted longer than anyone else's because Duzbat didn't dig for reasons. Duzbat dug because digging was what his body did, the way breathing was what lungs did, and asking him why was like asking a river why it flowed downhill.

He stood in the Fiveways and sniffed the air. His nostrils flared — enormous, cavernous nostrils that could, according to Scribat's unverified but passionately defended calculations, detect water through three metres of compacted clay.

"Water's moving," Duzbat said. These were, collectively, more words than he had spoken in the previous two days.

"Moving where?" Hoebat asked.

Duzbat pointed down. Then he hit the wall with his paw — not hard, not in anger, but with the precise, deliberate impact of a creature testing resonance. The wall answered with a low, dull note. Duzbat grunted. Either the note was satisfactory or it wasn't. No one could tell. Duzbat's face communicated emotion the way a boulder communicated poetry — through geological time.

The last to arrive was Rumbat, and he did not arrive so much as he *announced*. Three tunnels away, they heard it: a rhythmic stomping, paw-falls landing in a pattern that was too regular to be walking and too joyful to be marching. A beat. A pulse. The sound of a wombat who had discovered that the tunnel floor was a drum and his feet were the sticks and the entire subterranean world was his concert hall.

He came through Tunnel Five stomping a rhythm that made the bioluminescent moss on the ceiling flicker in time — a trick of vibration that Rumbat had discovered by accident and now exploited with the gleeful obsession of a musician who has found an instrument the size of a city. The moss pulsed blue-green, blue-green, blue-green, and the Fiveways lit up in strobes that turned the five young wombats into something that looked, for a moment, like a painting — frozen in light, caught between the dark.

"Ready?" Rumbat said, grinning. He was always grinning. He was a wombat who had found the one thing in the world that made sense to him, and it was rhythm, and it was everywhere, and it was free.

"Ready," said Scribat, bouncing on his toes.

Flickbat dropped from the ceiling and landed without sound.

Duzbat cracked his knuckles. The sound echoed like a small landslide.

Hoebat put his paw on the wall one last time. The hum was there. Faint. Patient. Waiting.

"Go."

## II. The Game (04:15)

Scribat went first because Scribat always went first because Scribat had drawn the map and would be *damned* if anyone else got lost following it before he had the chance to get lost following it himself.

They poured into Tunnel Four — the deep tunnel, the one that angled downward through strata of clay and sandstone and soil so old it had forgotten what the surface looked like. The walls were wet here, properly wet, glistening with the seep-water that filtered down from the aquifer above, and the floor was slick with a layer of organic clay that was half mud, half memory. The moss on the ceiling blazed as Rumbat's stomping feet sent vibrations upward, and the tunnel became a corridor of shifting blue-green light, as if they were running through the inside of a living thing.

Scribat narrated as he ran. "Left at the fork — no, YOUR left, Duzbat, your OTHER left — through the squeeze, under the root-bridge, don't touch the hanging moss because last time I touched it a beetle the size of my head—"

"FASTER!" Flickbat shouted from somewhere ahead. She had already passed him. She had passed him by going *through* a wall — or rather, through a gap in the wall that no one else had seen and that no reasonable wombat-shaped creature should have been able to fit through, and yet Flickbat was already on the other side, her voice echoing from a parallel tunnel like a ghost with a competitive streak.

The game had no name. It had no rules, or rather its rules were the kind that emerged organically from five young wombats with too much energy and too little supervision: get from the Fiveways to the Root Cathedral without using the main tunnels, without stopping, and without getting caught by Old Merrow or any of the other deep-tunnel residents who objected to having their ceilings used as a racetrack.

Hoebat ran in the middle of the pack, which was where he always ran — not leading, not following, but watching. Watching the way Scribat's charcoal marks on the walls glowed faintly in the moss-light, breadcrumbs through a world that shifted and breathed. Watching Duzbat's shoulders brush the tunnel walls and leave smooth grooves in the wet clay, like a river carving its banks. Watching Flickbat appear and disappear through gaps that seemed to open for her and close behind her, as if the tunnels were in on the joke.

And feeling, beneath his paws, the texture of the earth.

This was the thing Hoebat had that the others didn't, though he wouldn't know it for years: the ground spoke to him. Not in words — in pressures. In temperatures. In the subtle difference between clay that was resting and clay that was straining, between soil that was wet because water loved it and soil that was wet because water was fleeing through it. His paws read the ground the way Scribat's eyes read maps, and what they read, tonight, was a story of a world that was still whole.

The floor was warm. The walls were giving. The curves held.

They burst into the Root Cathedral and skidded to a halt.

## III. The Discovery (04:35)

The Root Cathedral was not a cathedral. It was a natural chamber where the root systems of three ancient eucalyptus trees had broken through the ceiling and grown downward, intertwining into a structure that looked — if you squinted, and if you had the kind of imagination that survives a childhood in the Fixed Borow — like the vaulted arches of a building designed by someone who had never heard of straight lines.

The roots were massive. The thickest was wider than Duzbat's chest, descending from the ceiling in a slow, woody spiral that buried itself in the chamber floor and kept going, deeper, into earth that no wombat had ever dug. The thinner roots laced between the thick ones like rigging on a ship, creating a canopy of wood and bark and the tiny, hair-thin rootlets that dangled from every surface and caught the moisture in the air and held it in beads that glowed in the moss-light like a thousand tiny moons.

"I will never get tired of this place," Scribat whispered, which was the closest Scribat ever came to silence.

They had found it six months ago — Flickbat, technically, who had followed a draft through a crack in Tunnel Seven and emerged into the chamber with the stunned expression of a creature who had discovered a room that the adults had somehow forgotten existed. They came here when the surface was too dangerous and the borows were too stifling and they needed a place that belonged to no one and therefore belonged to them.

Duzbat pressed his paw against the largest root and closed his eyes. He did this every time. He hit the root — gently, for Duzbat — and listened to the sound it made. A low, wooden thrum that resonated through the chamber and came back changed, as if the earth had heard it and answered in a different key.

"Different tonight," Duzbat said.

"Different how?" Hoebat asked.

Duzbat hit the root again. The sound was the same — or was it? There was something beneath it, or above it, or woven through it: a vibration that didn't come from the impact but from the root itself. As if the wood were carrying a signal from somewhere far above, conducting it down through the heartwood and the sapwood and the living tissue of a tree that had been standing for longer than Melborow had existed.

Hoebat put his paw on the root.

And stopped.

The root was humming.

Not the dull, dead hum of a pipe carrying water — a living hum. A frequency that pulsed and shifted and breathed, irregular as a heartbeat, warm as blood. It moved through the wood and into his paw and up his arm and settled in his chest like a second pulse, and for a moment — a single, vertiginous, impossibly clear moment — Hoebat felt the tree above. Not as an idea. As a *presence*. He felt the trunk sixty metres overhead, bending in a wind he had never felt. He felt the leaves shaking moisture into air he had never breathed. He felt the roots — all the roots, not just this one but the vast, branching, interconnected network that ran beneath Melborow like a nervous system — gripping the earth and holding it together, pulling water upward through clay and stone and time, feeding the world above by holding the world below.

The [[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Seventh Thread]]. The muscle memory of the earth. The thing that his father tried to reduce to a spreadsheet of counted roots and which was, in truth, a living web so vast and so old that counting it was like counting the ocean by its waves.

He didn't have words for it. He was twelve. He was a kid with his paw on a root in a chamber that smelled of wet bark and bioluminescent moss and the sweat of four friends who were watching him with the cautious curiosity of creatures who could see that something was happening but couldn't tell what.

"Hoebat?" Scribat said. "You alright? You've gone all... still."

Hoebat opened his eyes. His paw was trembling against the root. Not from fear — from the effort of holding a sensation that was too big for his body, like trying to cup a river in your palms.

"It's alive," he said. "The whole thing. The roots, the soil, the water — it's all... connected. It's all one thing."

Flickbat tilted her head. "Yeah. It's a tree, Hoebat. That's what trees do."

"No. Not just the tree. The *ground*. The tunnel walls, the clay, the water table — it's all holding on to each other. If you took one piece out..." He trailed off. The feeling was already fading, dissolving back into the root like water into soil, leaving only a warmth in his palm and a certainty he couldn't prove.

Rumbat stomped the floor. Twice. Three times. A pattern that matched the root's hum — not perfectly, because Rumbat was finding it by feel, adjusting his rhythm until the chamber resonated and the rootlets swayed and the tiny moons of moisture trembled in time. The [[../lore#Rituals|Old Way Dance]], or the seed of it, or the echo of something older than either — a wombat stomping the earth and the earth stomping back.

"Sounds right," Rumbat said. He didn't know what he meant. It would take him years to understand. But his feet knew, the way feet always know before brains do.

Duzbat grunted. Approval, probably. He hit the root one more time — a slow, resonant strike that harmonised with Rumbat's rhythm and made the entire chamber sing.

Scribat was already drawing. His charcoal scratched against the wall — a map of the root system, lines branching and rebranching, annotations in a shorthand only he could read. "We should come back with rope," he muttered. "Follow the main root up. See where it surfaces. If I can map the whole network—"

"Later," Hoebat said. His paw was still warm. The hum was still in his chest. He pressed his palm flat against the wall of the chamber — not the root, the wall itself, the compacted clay of the tunnel — and felt, just barely, the same vibration. Fainter. Older. The remnant of a web that had once run through everything and was now, slowly, pulling back.

He didn't know that he was feeling a world about to end. He was twelve. He thought the ground would always feel like this.

## IV. The Rumble (04:52)

It came through the floor.

Not the gentle vibration of the root-song — this was different. This was a grinding, metallic shudder that started far away and grew closer the way a thunderstorm grows closer, each pulse heavier than the last, and the walls of the Root Cathedral shook, and the hanging rootlets whipped sideways, and the beads of moisture fell from them like rain and shattered on the floor.

Every wombat froze. The ancient posture — weight forward, ears flat, nostrils flared. Five young bodies locked into a stance that ten thousand years of evolution had hammered into their bones: *something big is moving above you*.

"What is that?" Flickbat whispered.

Duzbat's nostrils flared. He put his paw on the floor and pressed, reading vibrations through his palm the way a doctor reads a pulse.

"Metal," he said. "Teeth. Digging."

A [[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monster]].

Hoebat had heard his father deny their existence at the dinner table so many times that the word had become almost mythological — a thing invoked by nervous wombats and dismissed by sensible ones, a story to scare joeys into staying in their borows. But the floor was shaking with a force that no amount of denial could absorb, and the ceiling of the Root Cathedral — the ancient, curved, beautifully organic ceiling that had held for centuries — was shedding dust.

"Out," Hoebat said. "Now."

They ran.

Scribat first, following his own charcoal marks backward through the tunnel, his narration replaced by a breathless panting that communicated the same information at a higher heart rate. Flickbat vanished through a wall-gap. Rumbat ran with his rhythm broken for the first time — his feet hitting the ground in the panicked, arrhythmic stumble of a drummer who has lost the beat. Duzbat ran last, his shoulders scraping the tunnel walls, his weight making the floor boom with each step.

Hoebat ran behind them, and then he stopped.

He stopped because Rumbat had stopped. Rumbat hadn't stopped by choice — his foot had gone through the floor. The vibration from the Yellow Monster had loosened a section of the tunnel floor where the clay met the sandstone, and Rumbat's stomping feet had found the weak point, and now his right leg was buried to the knee in a gap that was tightening around his shin as the shaking walls compressed.

"I'm stuck," Rumbat said. His voice was calm, which was worse than panic. Calm meant he was too scared to scream.

The ceiling shed another shower of dust. A crack appeared — a hairline fracture running across the curve of the tunnel roof like a sentence being written in a language that said: *this is temporary*.

The others were ahead. Flickbat was through the wall. Scribat was around the bend. Duzbat was — Duzbat had stopped. Duzbat was looking back, his enormous body blocking the tunnel, his face showing the first expression Hoebat had ever seen on it that was unambiguously readable: *fear*.

"Go," Hoebat told Duzbat. "Get the others out."

Duzbat hesitated. The ceiling cracked again — a sound like a knuckle popping, magnified a hundredfold.

"*Go.*"

Duzbat went. His footsteps thundered down the tunnel and faded and it was just Hoebat and Rumbat and the cracking ceiling and the grinding vibration of a machine that was eating the earth above them with the indifference of a god who had never heard of wombats.

Hoebat knelt. He put his paws on the clay around Rumbat's trapped leg and pressed — not desperately, not in panic, but with a focus that came from somewhere he didn't recognise. His paws read the soil. The gap was compressed on the right side, where the vibration had shifted the sandstone layer. The clay on the left was still wet, still giving. If he could dig along the left edge, following the wet line, he could widen the gap without destabilising the floor.

He dug. His claws — young claws, still sharp, not yet blunted by years of [[../lore#The New Ways (The Melborow Frequency)|Safety Grout]] — bit into the wet clay and carved a channel along the gap. The earth resisted, then gave, then resisted again, and Hoebat adjusted his angle with each stroke, reading the soil's response the way a conversation adjusts to tone.

Rumbat's leg came free. He scrambled up, gasping, limping, and Hoebat grabbed his arm and they ran.

Behind them, the crack in the ceiling widened. A piece of stone fell. Then another. The Root Cathedral, behind the bend, groaned — the deep, structural groan of a chamber whose curves were being tested by a force they were not designed to resist.

They burst into the Fiveways and collapsed. Scribat was there, and Flickbat was there, and Duzbat was there — all of them breathing hard, all of them covered in dust, all of them alive.

The shaking stopped.

The Yellow Monster, far above, had moved on. It had finished whatever it was doing to the earth in this section and had trundled away to do it somewhere else, leaving behind a trail of disrupted soil and structural damage and five young wombats who now knew — in their bones, in their paws, in the places where knowledge lives before it becomes words — that the ground was not as permanent as their fathers had promised.

Rumbat's paw found Hoebat's in the dark and squeezed.

"You came back," Rumbat said.

Hoebat didn't answer. His paws were shaking. Not from the running — from the digging. From the way the clay had spoken to his claws and his claws had listened. From the realisation, still wordless, still formless, settling into his young body like sediment into water, that he could hear what the ground was saying and he knew how to answer.

He was twelve years old, and he had just performed his first repair.

## V. Streets Still Alive (05:10)

They walked home through streets that were still streets.

Not corridors. Not regulated transit channels. Not Grid Sectors with numbered junctions and Council-approved signage. *Streets* — organic paths worn smooth by generations of wombat feet, curving through the earth in lines that followed water and instinct rather than bureaucratic geometry. The walls leaned. The ceilings arched. The moss glowed its steady blue-green, and the air smelled of wet clay and eucalyptus root and the faint, living musk of a city that was still, at its core, a borow — a place dug by paws, for paws, in the shape that paws understood.

They walked in a loose cluster, the way gangs walk — Scribat and Flickbat arguing about the fastest route home, Duzbat silent and immovable as a continent, Rumbat limping slightly but already stomping experimental rhythms with his good foot, testing the street-floor for resonance.

"I'm mapping that root system tomorrow," Scribat declared, waving a charcoal-stained paw. "Full survey. Every branch. Flickbat, you do the squeeze sections. Duzbat, you do the—"

"No," said Duzbat.

"No to which part?"

"Tomorrow. Rest."

"Fine. The day after tomorrow. First thing. Hoebat, you're leading because you did the thing with the wall and the — what did you do, exactly? With the digging? When Rumbat was stuck?"

Hoebat shrugged. "Just dug."

"You didn't 'just dig.' I dig. Duzbat digs. You did something else. You were... listening. To the mud."

"Clay."

"Whatever! You were listening to it, and then you dug in the exact right spot, and the floor didn't collapse even though it should have collapsed because the crack was—"

"Scribat."

"Yeah?"

"It's late."

They parted at the junction near the dormitory warrens — Scribat heading north toward his family's borow, still talking to himself; Flickbat disappearing upward into a ventilation shaft that was not designed for wombat traffic; Rumbat limping east, his feet finding rhythm even in exhaustion. Duzbat stood at the junction for a moment, looking at Hoebat with an expression that might have been gratitude or might have been constipation — with Duzbat, the margin was narrow.

"Good dig," Duzbat said. Then he turned and walked away, his footsteps shaking the floor in a slow, seismic goodbye.

Hoebat stood alone in the street.

The moss pulsed overhead. The walls curved around him, warm and close and alive. Somewhere far below, the root system of the eucalyptus grove hummed its patient song, carrying water and memory through heartwood and sapwood and into the earth that held Melborow together.

He pressed his paw against the wall. The hum was there. Fainter than in the Root Cathedral, but there — a thread of connection, running through the clay, linking everything to everything the way roots link a forest beneath the surface.

He stood like that for a long time.

Then he looked up.

There, in the curve of the ceiling directly above him — in the beautiful, organic, load-bearing arch that had held this street together for a hundred years — there was a crack.

It was small. Hairline. Running east-west, the direction of the Yellow Monster's passage. The clay around it was dry — not the healthy dryness of old clay but the brittle dryness of clay that has been shaken loose from its substrate, clay that is no longer part of the wall but merely resting against it.

It had not been there yesterday.

Hoebat stared at the crack. The crack stared back — a thin, dark line in a curved ceiling, a sentence written in a language that said: *I am the first word of a story you are not ready for*.

He reached up and pressed his paw against it. The clay crumbled at the edge, just slightly. Just enough. The hum beneath his palm flickered — strong, then weak, then strong again, like a heartbeat missing a step.

He could fix it. He could pack wet clay into the fracture and compress it and smooth it and the wall would hold. He knew he could. His paws knew. The knowledge was in his claws and his palms and the muscles of his forearms and the place in his chest where the root-song had settled, and it was certain, the way gravity is certain, the way water flowing downhill is certain.

But one repair would not be enough. He knew that too. The crack was not the disease — it was the symptom. Somewhere above, the Yellow Monsters were moving. Somewhere in the future, the curves would straighten. The wet clay would dry. The streets would become corridors, and the corridors would become grids, and the grids would be poured full of something grey and brittle that the wombats in charge would call *safety* and the wombats underneath would call *a coffin*.

But not yet.

Hoebat pulled his paw away from the crack and walked home through streets that were still alive, still curved, still wet.

Not yet.
