## I. The Announcement (06:00 — Trumbat)

The platform had been built overnight.

Not by Lo Snouts — Trumbat had learned long ago that the workers remembered what they built, and memory was a liability. The platform was assembled by Vitabat's enforcement crew: young, Kevlar-weave suited, silent. They hammered the Safety Grout slabs into place with the mechanical precision of creatures who had been told that asking "why" was a debt they couldn't afford.

The platform stood at the intersection of Sectors 7 and 8, directly above the main arterial tunnel of the Gray Grotto. It was tall enough that Trumbat could look down on the gathered crowd, which was the only spatial relationship Trumbat understood.

He wore the **Mitre of Inertia** — three grout blocks, miniaturised, balanced on his head in a stack that should have been impossible but was held in place by the same adhesive that held his platform together: confidence and fear, mixed in equal measure. His **Vestments of the Grid** — a grey robe laced with red stitching that the Cathedral tailors insisted was decorative and that Zuckbat's **Magistrates** knew was a functional antenna — hung from his shoulders in folds that made him look larger than he was, which was the point.

The Lo Snouts gathered in the intersection. Not because they chose to — the morning Frequency had carried a mandatory assembly notification, and "mandatory" in Trumbat's Melborow meant that your ration card was scanned at the entrance and your absence was notched into a **Tally** that Zuckbat kept archived in a directory he called "leverage."

Three hundred wombats. Shift workers, root-sellers, tunnel polishers, infrastructure grunts. Old Peg was there, her selling-stone left unattended for the first time in twelve years. Brenner was there, his one good eye scanning the crowd for his night crew. Widda was there, her paw still carrying the memory of the warm clay patch in the North-West corridor.

Trumbat raised his paws. The Frequency dropped — not off, never fully off, but reduced to a sub-audible hum that created the illusion of silence while maintaining its grip on the brainstem.

"My people," Trumbat began.

His voice was engineered. Not naturally — no wombat's voice carried the resonance that Trumbat's did without assistance. Muskbat had designed a sub-harmonic amplifier embedded in the Mitre that added a bass frequency to Trumbat's speech, making every word feel like it came from the walls themselves. When Trumbat spoke, the walls agreed.

"We have lived in fear long enough."

A murmur. Trumbat let it build. He was a conductor of murmurs.

"The cracks in our ceilings. The fractures in our floors. The rumble of the Yellow Monsters above us — *every morning*, my people. Every morning, they pour their stone on our heads, and we flinch. We flinch like animals!"

"We *are* animals," someone muttered. Brenner.

Trumbat didn't hear, or didn't register.

"But no more. Today, I give you the **Great Retaining Wall**. A structure of uncompromising strength, built by wombat paws, for wombat survival. It will run from Sector 7 to Sector 12 — a spine of Safety Grout that will hold back the pressure of the surface and ensure that no ceiling falls, no wall cracks, no family wakes to the sound of their home breaking."

He paused. Timing. Trumbat's pauses were architectural.

"And it will keep *them* out."

He didn't specify who "them" was. He never did. The genius of Trumbat's rhetoric was the blank space — the **[[../lore#The New Ways (The Melborow Frequency)|Section 2.4]]** void where each wombat could insert their own fear. Dingoes. Emus. The surface. The Tall-Ones. Whatever kept you awake at 3 AM, the wall was against it.

The crowd shifted. Some nodded. Some stared at the ground. A few — the old ones, the ones who remembered what walls did to the organisms on both sides of them — looked at each other with the weary recognition of creatures who had heard this speech before, in different words, from different platforms, and knew that the wall would be built regardless of what they thought about it.

"Let the pour begin!" Trumbat bellowed, and the Frequency surged back to operational volume, and the crowd dispersed into their shifts, and the day began.

## II. The Pour (08:00 — The Workers)

The grout was wrong.

Darragh knew it the moment the first batch arrived from the mixing station. He pressed his paw into the slurry and felt the grit-ratio — too much calciumite, not enough silica. The mix would set hard but brittle, which in structural terms was the difference between a wall that flexed under pressure and a wall that shattered.

"This is a Batch Seven mix," he told the foreman from the Cathedral's Engineering Division — a sleek-furred High-Nose named Parrin who held his clipboard the way a priest holds scripture. "Batch Seven is rated for surface cladding. Interior vertical structures need a Batch Twelve. More silica. More flex."

Parrin didn't look up from his clipboard. "The specification calls for Batch Seven."

"The specification is wrong."

"The specification was approved by the Sovereign of Infrastructure."

"Trumbat doesn't know the difference between Batch Seven and a bucket of spit."

"The specification was approved by the Sovereign of Infrastructure," Parrin repeated, as if the sentence had a structural integrity that improved with repetition.

Darragh looked at his crew. Twelve Lo Snouts, paws ready, mixing trowels in hand. They looked back at him with the expression of workers who knew the mix was wrong and also knew that pointing this out would result in a notation on their ration card, which was the modern equivalent of pointing a gun at someone's dinner.

"Pour it," Darragh said. And hated himself a little more than yesterday.

The pour began at the Sector 7 terminus. Wombats hauled the slurry in wooden troughs, slopping it into the foundation trench that Vitabat's enforcement crew had excavated the night before. The trench was deep — two metres, cutting through the substrate that generations of Lo Snout engineers had carefully layered and compressed using the **[[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Seventh Thread]]** techniques. The excavation had severed root networks, cracked clay-pack reinforcements, and exposed the raw bedrock beneath — pale, dry, cold.

Widda worked the Sector 8 junction. She poured with the mechanical efficiency of a shift worker, but her eyes kept drifting to the trench wall. There, embedded in the substrate the excavation had exposed, she could see something the engineers hadn't noticed — or hadn't cared about.

Repair clay. The same warm, river-stone-flecked material she had found in the North-West corridor. Veins of it, running through the substrate like gold threads in broken pottery, connecting the load-bearing pillars in a web that she suddenly understood was not random but *designed*. Each repair linked to the next, creating a distribution network that spread the weight of the ceiling across the entire sector.

The trench had cut through the web. The repairs were exposed, severed, the clay already beginning to dry and crack at the edges where it met the raw air.

Widda felt something cold settle in her chest. She knew — not with her mind, which could rationalise anything, but with her paws, which had pressed against the Ghost's work and felt its heartbeat — that the thing being destroyed was the thing keeping them alive.

She kept pouring. What else was there to do?

## III. The Counter-Operation (10:00 — Kappa Mu)

Beneath the pour, the squad moved.

**Merl** was in the service tunnels below Sector 9, his feet reading the vibrations of the grout as it set. Each new section of wall changed the harmonic signature of the surrounding structure — adding mass here, redirecting pressure there. He mapped the changes in real-time, his three-toed feet pressing the substrate with the precision of a seismograph.

The data was not good.

The wall's foundation trench had severed four of Hoebat's eleven major repair connections in Sectors 7 and 8. The remaining seven were absorbing the redirected load, but the asymmetric pressure was already producing micro-fractures in the substrate — hairline cracks, invisible to the eye, but screaming to Merl's feet like alarm bells rung in glass.

He tapped a sequence into the tunnel wall — a coded vibration that would travel through the root-network to Hoebat's position two sectors south. Three long, two short, one long. Translation: *Load shifting. Seven remaining. Estimate twelve hours before cascade failure.*

**Cooroo** was airborne, three hundred metres above the Gray Grotto, riding a thermal that the morning sun pushed off the Cathedral's ventilation stacks. From here, the Human construction site was visible — a grid of steel and form-work where the next floor of the skyscraper was taking shape. Cranes swung. Grout trucks lined the access road. Workers in hard hats moved across the surface with the oblivious efficiency of creatures who had no idea that an entire civilisation existed beneath their boots.

The convergence was undeniable. From above, Cooroo could see it with the geometric clarity that only altitude provided: the Human foundation pressing down, The Great Retaining Wall pressing in, and the Gray Grotto — the thin stratum of wombat life sandwiched between them — compressing.

He adjusted his flight path and ran a frequency check. The return was wrong. The harmonic that had been stable for months — the steady, deep tone of a ceiling holding its weight — had shifted. A new frequency was emerging. Higher. Tighter. The sound of stone under pressure that exceeded its tolerance.

The sound of a city being squeezed.

**Bash** crouched in a maintenance alcove near the Council's communications relay — a junction box where the encrypted internal channels converged before being routed to the Cathedral. His antenna was tuned to the Council's emergency band, the one they used for messages they didn't want on the public Frequency.

The traffic was heavy. Triple-encrypted, as he'd told the Assembly, but the buffer overflow in Muskbat's codec was real, and Bash had been exploiting it since he'd first discovered it six months ago. He peeled the encryption like bark from a log and read the plaintext.

Most of it was administrative — pour schedules, material requisitions, Parrin's meticulous (and meticulous wrong) structural reports. But one message, flagged Sovereign Priority, stopped him cold.

FROM: ENGINEERING DIVISION (PARRIN)
TO: SOVEREIGN COUNCIL — INTERNAL
RE: STRUCTURAL VARIANCE — SECTORS 7-12

*During excavation of the wall foundation trench, the engineering team has identified non-standard substrate reinforcements in the load-bearing zones of Sectors 7, 8, and 10. The reinforcements are composed of organic clay-pack material consistent with traditional "Old Way" compression techniques. These reinforcements are NOT in any Council-approved structural plan.*

*Preliminary analysis suggests these unauthorized modifications have been maintaining structural integrity across the affected sectors. Their removal during trench excavation has resulted in immediate load redistribution to adjacent pillars.*

*Recommendation: HALT POUR pending full structural assessment.*

The reply came fourteen minutes later.

FROM: SOVEREIGN OF INFRASTRUCTURE (TRUMBAT)
TO: ENGINEERING DIVISION
RE: RE: STRUCTURAL VARIANCE

*Continue the pour. The Great Retaining Wall Increase batch volume by 20%. I want Sectors 7 through 10 completed by sunset.*

*The "unauthorized modifications" are sabotage. Document and report to Intelligence.*

Bash stared at the message. Trumbat's own engineers were telling him the wall would destroy the repairs that were keeping the city standing, and Trumbat's response was to pour faster.

He coded the intercept into a vibration sequence and tapped it into the nearest root-network node — a direct transmission to the Root Chamber where Hoebat was working the contingency repairs.

**Pokero** was in the Sector 10 worker's camp.

He had arrived at dawn, before the pour began, carrying nothing — no tools, no message, no agenda visible enough to trigger suspicion. He sat at the edge of the camp's common area, near the water station, and waited.

The workers noticed him. Of course they noticed him — a Dingo in a wombat work camp was as subtle as a fire in a library. The first reactions were predictable: tension, whispered warnings, mothers pulling children closer. The scent of predator overriding the evidence of passivity.

Pokero sat. He drank water when it was offered — not from the workers, who wouldn't offer, but from the communal tap, which didn't discriminate by species. He ate a piece of root that he'd brought from the Western borows — openly, unhurriedly, the way you eat when you want to demonstrate that your jaw is occupied with food and not with the alternative.

By mid-morning, the children came. They always came first. Children had not yet learned the architecture of fear that their parents had been building for decades. They looked at Pokero and saw what was there — a creature with interesting ears and a tail that moved in patterns they wanted to decode.

Pokero told them a story. The same one he'd told the crying Lo Snout girl in the marketplace. A story about a Dingo who ran so fast he caught the sun and brought it back to a borow that had been dark for a thousand years.

The workers watched from the edges. They did not approach. But they listened.

And the mirror worked. Slowly, in the way that real things always work — not with a flash of revelation but with the gradual recognition that the creature sitting at their water station had been sitting there for six hours and had not once bared his teeth.

## IV. The Crack (17:30)

It happened at the junction of Sectors 8 and 9.

The pour had reached the midpoint. Twelve hours of continuous work. The wall rose from the trench like a grey spine — two metres high, half a metre thick, running through the Grotto in a line that bisected the residential warrens from the work zones. It was, by any structural measure, impressive. It was also, by any structural measure, catastrophic.

Hoebat had been working below for nine hours straight, reinforcing the remaining repair connections ahead of the pour, trying to build a new distribution web fast enough to absorb the load that the wall was redirecting. His paws were raw. His shoulders burned. The clay was running out — the seep-bed supply was not infinite, and nine hours of emergency repairs had consumed a week's worth of material.

He was too slow.

He felt it through his feet — the same way Merl felt it, the same way every creature trained in the Seventh Thread felt structural failure: not as a sound but as a *cessation* of sound. The constant, low hum of a building under manageable stress — the background music of a functioning structure — went silent for a fraction of a second. Then came the new sound: a sharp, high-pitched tone, like a wire snapping in a piano. A load-bearing pillar in Sector 8, unsupported since the trench had severed its repair connection twelve hours ago, had reached its limit.

On the surface, the crack appeared.

Not in the wall — the wall was new, rigid, unyielding. The crack appeared in the *floor* beside the wall, running perpendicular to it like a tributary joining a river. It was thin — barely visible, a dark line in the grey substrate. But it ran fast. In the ten seconds between its appearance and the moment the nearest worker noticed it, the crack had extended three metres.

Darragh saw it. He dropped his trowel and knelt, pressing his paw flat against the floor the way his grandmother had taught him — feeling for the vibration, reading the earth.

The earth was screaming.

"Stop the pour," he said.

No one stopped.

"STOP THE POUR!"

Parrin looked up from his clipboard. "The Sovereign has ordered—"

"The floor is splitting. Right here. Feel it."

Parrin did not kneel. Parrin did not press his paw to the floor. Parrin looked at the crack, looked at his clipboard, and said: "Hairline fracture. Cosmetic. Within tolerance."

"Within whose tolerance?"

"Continue the pour."

The pour continued.

Hoebat, below, felt the crack through the substrate. He knew what it was — not a hairline fracture, not cosmetic, but the first whisper of a cascade failure that would propagate through the weakened pillar network like a fault line through glass. The repair-ahead plan had bought time. But time was a finite resource, and the wall was consuming it faster than he could manufacture it.

He tapped the emergency sequence into the root-network. Three long, three short, three long. The oldest code. The one that predated Kappa Mu, predated the Fixed Borow, predated everything except the earth itself.

*The ceiling is coming down.*

Above, in the last light of the day, the crack widened another millimetre. The wall stood. The floor spoke. And three hundred Lo Snouts went home through tunnels that felt, for the first time, like they were breathing their last.
