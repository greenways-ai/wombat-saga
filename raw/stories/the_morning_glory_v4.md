# The Morning Glory (Tone Exploration — 80% Rowling / 20% Asimov)

**Notes:** Rowling leads. The narrator is warm, wry, close to Cooroo, fond of him. The Asimov 20% shows up as occasional precision — a measurement, a mechanism, a moment where the narrator steps back and explains *how* something works rather than just *that* it happens. These moments are brief and embedded in the flow, never more than a sentence or two before the warmth returns. The effect should be a story that feels like Rowling wrote it after reading a very good nature documentary.

# The Morning Glory

Cooroo had stopped screaming, which was, as far as anyone in the colony could recall, a thing that had never happened to a Galah before and which no one was entirely sure how to deal with.

Galahs screamed. It was what they did. Other species had their own talents — wombats dug, dingoes ran, emus stared at you until you felt personally responsible for the state of the universe — but Galahs screamed, and they screamed the way rivers flowed, which is to say constantly, without apology, and often at four in the morning. A Galah who had stopped screaming was not simply a quiet bird. It was a contradiction. A river that had forgotten which direction was downhill.

He hadn't meant it to happen. He'd woken one morning, three weeks after the Great Jacaranda came down, opened his beak to do the dawn call, and produced a noise that was to a proper scream what a candle is to a bonfire. The machinery was there — he could feel it working, the syrinx contracting, the air flowing, the resonating chambers in his skull doing their level best. His mother had always said the chambers were oversized, in the proud, slightly nervous way a parent notes that their child has inherited the loud gene from both sides of the family and there is nothing to be done about it now.

Everything worked. Nothing came out. Or rather, something came out, but it was the shape of a scream without the substance of one. A draught where a gale should have been.

He hadn't told his mother. Cooriki had enough silence of her own.

---

She sat on a low branch of a lesser Jacaranda, three hundred metres south of the stump, and stared at the place where the Great One had stood. She had been doing this for twenty-one days. She ate when Cooroo brought her seeds — he'd learned to select the fat ones, the ones with the dark shells, because she wouldn't bother with anything that required effort to crack. She drank when it rained. She did not fly, or call, or do any of the things that had made her the Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony for eleven years.

Once, on the ninth day, she had spoken. Cooroo had been sitting beside her in the kind of companionable silence that is not really silence at all but a conversation conducted in the language of not leaving.

"The Noble Noise has no return," she'd said, still looking at the stump. "It just goes."

Cooroo hadn't understood. He would, later — much later, when he'd learned enough about the Violet Resonance to know that Cooriki was describing a systems failure as precisely as any technician could — but at the time, all he heard was his mother's voice sounding the way the stump sounded when he tapped it with his claw: hollow, and warm, and finished with being what it used to be.

---

The colony was gone. This had happened quickly, the way things happen quickly when the structure that held them together disappears and everyone discovers, all at once, that they'd been relying on something they'd assumed was permanent.

The Callers — the Galahs with the strongest resonance — had followed surviving Jacarandas south, crowding onto branches too young to properly amplify anything but recognisable as the right kind of wood. The Fliers had gone further. Some had ended up on the ornamental trees along the Tall-Ones' roads, which were to a real Jacaranda what tinned soup is to a meal: technically nourishing, spiritually bankrupt, but available.

Cooroo had stayed. His wings were too young for long distances, and he was too stubborn to say so. Stubbornness was the family inheritance. His mother had once screamed at a thunderstorm for forty minutes because it had the temerity to interrupt her dawn call. The storm moved on. Cooriki hadn't. It was not clear, even to Cooriki, whether this counted as victory.

---

He spent his days on the stump.

It was enormous — a wide, pale oval of exposed heartwood, cut at a rough angle by the Yellow Monster's arm. The Monster had not been gentle. Monsters were not built for gentleness any more than Galahs were built for silence; it was outside the design specifications. The arm had swung, the trunk had cracked — a sound Cooroo still heard in his sleep, the sound of something very old breaking because something very large didn't know it was there — and two hundred years of tree had fallen in stages, the way giants fall: disbelief, lean, surrender.

The operator had filed the remains under "Site Prep: Day 1" and gone home for tea.

The rings were visible on the cut face. Cooroo didn't know how to read them — that was wombat work, and wombats were welcome to it; they liked counting things the way Galahs liked screaming, which is to say pathologically — but he could feel the wood warm beneath his claws. Not alive-warm. Something else. The kind of warmth that lingers in a chair after someone stands up. A memory of occupation. The tree had been conducting resonance through this wood for two centuries, and the wood had not yet learned that the conducting was over.

Cooroo liked the stump. It was the right height for a bird who wasn't flying, which was a thought he kept at the edges of his mind where it couldn't bother him too much.

---

Beyond the stump, the ridge dropped into what Cooroo had started calling the Bad Ground.

He'd called it this since the fourth day, when he'd noticed the sheen. Before the Tall-Ones' machines came, the slope had been native grass and scrub — the kind of unremarkable ground-cover that nobody notices until it's gone, at which point everybody notices, too late, that it was the thing holding the dirt together. The machines had scraped it clean. What remained was bare substrate — pale, compacted, stripped of everything that had been growing on it since before Cooroo's grandmother's grandmother had screamed her first dawn call.

The sheen was faint. You had to catch it at the right angle, the way you sometimes catch the shimmer on a soap bubble just before it pops. But once you saw it, you couldn't unsee it. The ground was patterning. Hexagons, interlocking, repeating, marching down the slope in rows so regular they looked deliberate.

They weren't deliberate. There was no mind behind them. The patterning was what happened when you removed the rough, living, tangled layer of roots and scrub that had been preventing it — the way dust settles into neat lines on a shelf once you stop disturbing it. The lattice, Pokero would have called it. The Static tiling. Cooroo called it the Bad Ground and stayed away from it, because his feathers went flat every time he looked at it, and a Galah who ignores his feathers is a Galah who walks into walls.

The sheen was, he had to admit, beautiful. That was the worst part. It caught the dawn light and threw it back in angles that made the slope look like the inside of something precious — geometric, clean, certain. It was the certainty that bothered him. The ground had made up its mind. It had decided what it was, and what it was, was a pattern that repeated forever and never needed to ask anyone's opinion.

Cooroo did not trust things that had finished deciding. He was a Galah. Galahs were creatures of permanent, enthusiastic indecision, and they considered this a virtue.

---

On the twenty-first morning, he woke on the stump, faced east, and saw the flower.

It was growing at the edge of the Bad Ground — right where the scraped substrate met the surviving scrub. The boundary between the two was not a clean line. It was ragged, messy, torn — the kind of edge that happened when a machine stopped scraping and the earth was left to figure out for itself where the dying stopped and the living started. Fingers of dirt reached into the dead ground. Fingers of dead ground reached into the dirt.

In one of those fingers — in a crack no wider than a Galah's claw, where a crumb of organic soil had washed into a fissure in the patterned surface — a vine had taken root.

It was a small vine. Thin-stemmed, climbing a dead stick with the quiet determination of a plant that had looked at its options, found them lacking, and decided that *up* was the best available direction. Three heart-shaped leaves, absurdly green against the grey. And at the top, open to the first light like a small trumpet announcing the arrival of someone very important to an audience of one startled bird:

A flower. Lilac. With a throat darker than the petals, the colour deepening inward the way the sky deepens at the zenith.

Cooroo stared at it. His crest rose. He hadn't told it to. His crest had its own opinions about things and rarely consulted him before expressing them.

The flower was the colour of the sky at dawn. Not the blue — the bit before the blue. The five-minute window, just before sunrise, when the sky went lilac — when it remembered, briefly, that it had once been violet before the day arrived and ironed it into blue. Most creatures slept through it. Galahs didn't, because Galahs didn't sleep through anything, and because the dawn was the hour they screamed at, and the colour of the thing you scream at every morning of your life gets into your feathers whether you mean it to or not.

The Morning Glory had caught that colour and was holding it open.

And the colour was the colour of Cooroo's own body. His crest. His breast. The rose-pink, lilac, not-quite-violet that every other species described as "loud" and Galahs described as "us."

He hopped off the stump. A Galah on the ground, hopping toward a flower. His claws clicked on the bare substrate. Each click felt wrong — too clean, too even, the ground returning the same sound at the same pitch from the same surface — and then he reached the crack where the vine grew, and the clicks changed. Softer. Uneven. The sound of a claw on dirt. On *actual dirt*, the kind that had things living in it and didn't know what a pattern was.

He squatted in front of the Morning Glory and felt the colour enter him through his feathers and slide down his spine and settle in the resonating chambers where his scream used to live. The chambers hummed. Faintly — barely there — like a wire that has just started carrying current and hasn't yet decided how much.

His mother had told him once, adjusting his neck-feathers in the canopy of the Great Jacaranda, her voice warm and offhand the way it always was when she was saying something that would take him years to understand:

*"We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky."*

He'd laughed. He was a fledgling. It was the kind of thing mothers said.

He was not laughing now. He was looking at a flower that was the same colour as his own chest, growing in a crack in the dead ground, and the resonating chambers in his skull were humming for the first time in three weeks, and he understood — not in words, not the way Pokero understood things in data or Merl understood things in strategy, but in feathers, which was the Galah way — what his mother had meant.

Blue, squeezed, turns lilac. The sky, pressed into a space small enough for a flower, shifts frequency — the way a note jumps an octave when you push it past its range. The colour doesn't break. It *changes*. Compressed blue becomes violet. That's what lilac is. That's what Galahs are. That's what the Morning Glory was showing him, in a trumpet of petals on a dead stick in a crack in the worst ground on the Eastern Ridge:

The sky survives compression. It just comes out a different colour.

---

He came back every morning for a week.

The flower opened at dawn. Closed at noon. Opened the next morning — slightly wider, slightly deeper in colour, the stem two millimetres longer, the whole vine fractionally more itself. Not the same flower repeated. The same *idea* repeated, with variations, the way a mother hums the same lullaby every night and it's never quite the same because she's a day tireder and the child is a day older and the dark outside the window is a different dark.

This was not how the Bad Ground worked. The Bad Ground repeated its pattern exactly — same hexagon, same angle, same sheen — because the pattern didn't care what day it was. The flower cared. The flower was paying attention. And because it was paying attention, it was *changing*, and because it was changing, it was alive, and because it was alive, it was growing in a crack in the one surface in Arnamland that had decided, with geometric finality, that nothing would ever grow on it again.

On the seventh morning, Cooroo knew what to do. Not because he'd thought it through. Because his feathers told him, and his feathers had been right about the Bad Ground and right about the flower and right about the hum in his chambers, and he was done arguing with his feathers.

*Find this colour.*

---

He flew again. Short distances — his wings were young and his endurance was, frankly, humiliating — but he flew, and he screamed his frequency checks at the ground, and the checks came back empty because there was no Jacaranda to catch them.

His voice couldn't find what he was looking for. His eyes could.

He searched for lilac. For violet. For the condensed-sky colour that showed up wherever the ground was cracked and rough and too stubborn to be grey. He searched the margins — the drainage channels, the edges of the construction site, the places where runoff pooled and dirt collected in fissures and the Bad Ground's geometry broke down just enough for something messy to take hold.

He searched the heartwood pile. This was the heap of splintered Jacaranda that the Yellow Monster had shoved aside after cutting the Great One down — two hundred years of tree, reduced to a tangle of broken wood that the operator's report had described as "cleared debris." The wood had been sitting in weather for five weeks. It was softening. It smelled of tannin and old rain and something sweeter — the smell of wood remembering how to be soil.

On the fourteenth day, he found the seed.

It was wedged in a crack between two splintered planks — the Great Jacaranda's own wood, its own body — where rain had pooled and the decomposing heartwood had leached its chemistry into a tiny puddle of dark, warm, not-quite-mud. The seed was no bigger than Cooroo's eye. Brown. Rough-coated, with the lumpy, asymmetric surface of a thing designed by a process that had priorities other than looking nice.

It did not glow. It did not sing. It sat in its crack of wet wood and looked like nothing.

Cooroo picked it up. Held it on his tongue. And felt — faint as a whisper, warm as the stump on an afternoon — a hum. The same hum. The Morning Glory's hum. The condensed-sky frequency, packed into a rough brown shell the size of an eye.

Not lilac yet. Not anything yet. But the possibility of lilac, the way a held breath is the possibility of a scream.

He flew it to the stump. He pushed it into the crack where the cut wood met the living root — the root that was still there, still in the ground, still connected to the channels that two hundred years of Jacaranda had carved through the substrate. The root was not dead. Dormant. Waiting for an input it had stopped expecting.

The seed settled into the crack. Brown speck. Grey stump. The whole thing looked like absolutely nothing.

Cooroo screamed.

It was terrible. It was the worst scream he had ever produced — raw, cracked, artless, a gate hinge caught in a cyclone, the sound of a juvenile Galah with oversized chambers and no training and no tree, standing on a dead stump screaming at a seed because a flower had taught him that the sky, pushed hard enough, turns lilac — and lilac is the colour of everything that refuses to be grey.

It was also, technically, the first sound he had made in five weeks. It came from the resonating chambers that had been empty — not broken, never broken, just *waiting* — and it filled the dawn the way the Morning Glory's colour filled the crack: completely, gracelessly, and without the faintest interest in whether anyone thought it was beautiful.

Three hundred metres south, Cooriki's crest rose.

She didn't fly to him. Not yet. But she turned her head. It was the first time she had turned toward anything since the Great Jacaranda fell, and the movement was small — just a bird turning her head on a branch — but small things are how the large things start. A crack is how a vine gets in. A hum is how a scream comes back. A seed is how a tree begins.

The seed sat in its crack. The root sat in its ground. The stump sat in its morning.

And at the edge of the Bad Ground, a native Morning Glory — *Ipomoea costata*, the Rock Glory, the vine that grows in desert gravel and riverbeds and the rough edges where the pattern breaks — held its lilac trumpet open to the dawn and showed the compressed sky to a world that had forgotten what blue looks like when you squeeze it hard enough to change.
