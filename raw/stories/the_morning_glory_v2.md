# The Morning Glory (Tone Exploration — JK Rowling Register)

**Notes:** This file explores the same story beats as `the_morning_glory.md` but shifts the narrative voice toward a Rowling-ish register: warm third-person close, dry wit, concrete detail over abstract philosophy, emotion through understatement, a narrator who is fond of the character and slightly amused by the world even when the world is sad. The metaphysics (the lattice, the fractal, the condensed sky) should emerge from Cooroo's physical experience rather than being explained by the narrator.

# The Morning Glory

Cooroo had stopped screaming, which, for a Galah, was roughly the equivalent of a fish deciding it had gone off swimming.

He hadn't meant to stop. There had been no dramatic moment of renunciation, no decision taken at midnight on a windswept branch. He'd simply woken up one morning, three weeks after the Great Jacaranda came down, opened his beak to do what Galahs do at dawn — and produced a sound that was to a proper scream what a damp tissue is to a towel. The mechanics were all there. His syrinx contracted. Air moved through his throat. His resonating chambers — which his mother had always said were oversized, in the proud, slightly worried tone of a parent who suspects their child may turn out to be *very loud indeed* — vibrated dutifully.

Nothing came out. Or rather, something came out, but it was the ghost of a scream. A scream's obituary. The place where a scream used to live, furnished with air.

He hadn't told his mother. Cooriki had her own silence to manage, and it was larger than his. She sat on the low branch of a lesser Jacaranda three hundred metres south of the stump, staring at the place where the Great One had stood, with the fixed, glassy expression of a creature who was looking at something that wasn't there anymore and couldn't quite believe the world had the audacity to continue without it.

Cooroo visited her every morning. He would hop along the branch — Galahs are not graceful walkers; they move like small pink commuters late for a train — and sit beside her, and they would share a silence that was louder than anything either of them had ever screamed.

The colony was gone. The Callers had followed the surviving Jacarandas south. The Fliers had scattered to whatever branch would hold them. A few had ended up on the ornamental trees the Tall-Ones planted along their roads — trees that were to a real Jacaranda what a plastic flower is to a garden, but in the weeks after the fall, a stable branch was a stable branch and nobody was being picky.

Cooroo had stayed because he was too young to fly the distance and too stubborn to admit it. Stubbornness ran in the family. Cooriki had once screamed at a thunderstorm for forty minutes because it was disrupting her frequency check. The thunderstorm had moved on. Cooriki hadn't.

---

He spent most of his days on the stump.

The stump of the Great Jacaranda was enormous — a wide, pale oval of exposed wood, cut at a careless angle by the Yellow Monster's arm. The Monster hadn't been trying to make a neat job of it. Monsters, in Cooroo's limited experience, rarely did. They swung, and things fell down, and whatever was left was described in a report somewhere as "Site Prep" and filed in a drawer that nobody opened.

The rings were visible. Cooroo didn't know how to count them — ring-reading was a wombat skill, and wombats counted everything, which Cooroo found exhausting — but he could feel the wood still warm beneath his claws. Not living-warm. Not sun-warm. A deeper warmth, like the last heat in a mug of tea after the tea is gone. The wood remembered being a tree the way old things remember being young: faintly, persistently, without knowing how to stop.

He liked the stump. It was the right height for a Galah who wasn't flying, which was a thought he tried not to examine too closely.

---

Beyond the stump, the Eastern Ridge dropped into what Cooroo thought of as the Bad Grounds.

It had been a perfectly good slope three weeks ago — native grass, scrub, the usual tangle of things growing where they pleased. Then the Tall-Ones had scraped it bare for their construction site, and what was left looked wrong in a way that made Cooroo's feathers press flat against his body. Flat feathers, in a Galah, meant the same thing as a raised hackle in a dog or a clenched jaw in a wombat: something is off, and the body knows it before the brain catches up.

The ground had a sheen. Faint, but there if you caught it at the right angle — a geometric glimmer, like frost, except frost melted and this didn't. The sheen made patterns. Hexagons, mostly, interlocking, repeating, stretching down the slope in a way that was undeniably pretty and made Cooroo want to be somewhere else immediately.

He didn't have a word for what he was seeing. Pokero would have called it the lattice. Hoebat would have felt it through his paws and known that the ground was dying. Cooroo just knew that the Bad Grounds looked like something that had made up its mind, and things that had made up their minds completely — things with no mess, no argument, no rough edges — made him deeply uneasy.

He avoided it. He sat on his stump and faced east, where the sky was still doing its job properly, which was to be large and blue and slightly different every time you looked at it.

---

On the twenty-first morning, he saw the flower.

It was growing at the edge of the Bad Grounds — right at the boundary where the scraped substrate met the surviving scrub. The boundary was not a neat line. It was ragged, messy, the kind of edge that would have made Zuckbat reach for a ruler and Hoebat reach for his clay. Fingers of living dirt poked into the dead ground, and fingers of dead ground poked into the dirt, and in one of those fingers — in a crack barely wide enough for a Galah's claw — a vine had taken root.

It was a small vine. A single stem, thinner than a feather, climbing a dead stick with the quiet determination of a thing that has nowhere else to go and has decided that *up* is a direction. Three heart-shaped leaves, improbably green against the grey. And at the top, open to the dawn like a tiny trumpet announcing something to an audience of one very startled bird:

A flower. Lilac.

Cooroo stared at it.

He had seen a great many things in his short life — the Great Jacaranda in full bloom, the Cathedral's ventilation shafts breathing their perfumed air, the Yellow Monster's arm silhouetted against a sky it was too stupid to appreciate — but he had never seen anything that looked so much like it wasn't supposed to be there and was there anyway, out of what appeared to be sheer botanical stubbornness.

The flower was the colour of the sky at dawn. Not the blue part — the part just before the blue, the part most creatures slept through. The lilac part. The five-minute window when the sky remembered it had once been violet before the day arrived and flattened it into respectability. The Morning Glory had caught that five-minute window and was holding it open with its petals, as if to say: *you thought this was over. It isn't.*

The lilac deepened at the throat. Darker toward the centre, the way the sky darkens at the zenith — the colour concentrating inward, compressing, as though the whole blue of the atmosphere had been squeezed through a funnel and come out the other side as violet.

Cooroo's crest rose. He hadn't told it to. His feathers — which had been flat with dread every time he looked at the Bad Grounds — were lifting, fanning, responding to the colour the way they used to respond to his mother's voice. A resonance. Not sound. Colour. But his body didn't care about the difference. His body had been waiting for something to vibrate to, and the lilac was vibrating, and the vibrating was making the inside of his skull hum in the place where his scream used to live.

He hopped off the stump. A Galah on the ground, hopping across grey dirt toward a flower. If any of the colony had been there to see it, they would have laughed. Cooroo would have laughed too, normally. But the flower was the colour of his own crest, and the coincidence — or the not-coincidence — was doing something to his chest that he didn't have a word for.

His mother had told him once, adjusting his neck-feathers in the canopy of the Great Jacaranda, her voice warm and matter-of-fact: *"We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky."*

He'd laughed. It was a funny thing to say. Everything his mother said was a bit funny and a bit true and you didn't always know which was which until later.

He wasn't laughing now. He was squatting in front of a Morning Glory that was the same colour as his body, and understanding — in the slow, physical way that birds understand things, not in the head but in the feathers — what she'd meant.

Blue, squeezed, becomes lilac. Sky, compressed into a flower, becomes violet. The same thing had happened to Galahs, and to this vine, and to the dawn. The colour was the evidence. Wherever the world was being pressed hardest, the blue showed up as pink.

---

The flower closed at noon. Cooroo had known it would — Morning Glories weren't the type to hang about — but watching it happen was like watching a door shut on a room you'd only just discovered. The petals furled inward, the lilac dimmed to a pale twist, and the vine went back to being a vine: green, thin, ordinary, growing in a crack.

He came back the next morning. The flower opened again. Different — slightly larger, tilted a few degrees further east, the lilac fractionally deeper. The same rule, applied again, producing a different result. This was not the Bad Grounds's trick, which was to repeat the same pattern forever. This was the other thing. The alive thing. The thing that did the same thing twice and got a different answer because the world had moved underneath it.

He came back every morning for a week. Each day the flower opened. Each day his feathers rose. Each day the hum in his resonating chambers grew a fraction louder, as if the colour were tuning an instrument that hadn't been played in weeks and was remembering, string by string, what music was for.

On the seventh day, he realised what the flower was teaching him.

Not the metaphysics — Cooroo would never be the metaphysics type; that was Pokero's department, and welcome to it. The flower was teaching him something simpler. It was teaching him what to look for.

Lilac. Violet. The condensed-sky colour that showed up wherever the world was cracked and alive and too stubborn to be grey.

---

He started flying again.

Not far. His wings were still young and his stamina was embarrassing — three circuits of the Ridge and he was panting like a wallaby who'd taken the stairs. But he flew, and he screamed his frequency checks at the ground, and the checks came back empty because there was no Jacaranda to amplify them, and he didn't care because his eyes were doing what his voice couldn't.

He looked for violet.

He looked in the cracks between the dead ground and the living ground. He looked in the drainage channels where the Tall-Ones' runoff pooled and went warm. He looked at the margins, the edges, the waste places — the spots that the construction site treated as the gaps between the things that mattered.

He found the seed on the fourteenth day.

It was in the heartwood pile — the heap of splintered wood that the Yellow Monster had shoved to the edge of the site after cutting the Great Jacaranda down. The pile had been rained on, dried out, rained on again, and was slowly doing what dead wood does when left alone, which is to stop being a tree and start being soil. The process is not glamorous. It smells of tannin and old tea and the particular sweetness of a thing decomposing in the direction of usefulness.

In a crack between two splintered planks — where rainwater had pooled and the rotting heartwood had leached its chemistry into a tiny puddle of dark, warm, not-quite-mud — Cooroo found a seed.

It was no bigger than his eye. Brown. Rough. Lumpy in the way that seeds are lumpy, which is the way of a thing that was designed by a process that cared about survival and couldn't give a toss about aesthetics. It did not glow. It did not hum. It sat in its crack of damp wood and looked, to any reasonable observer, like absolutely nothing.

Cooroo picked it up. He could feel it on his tongue — a faint, warm pulse, like the stump-warmth but deeper, denser, more compressed. The brown shell held something. Not yet colour. Not yet wood. Not yet the canopy and the resonance and the covenant and the bloom. Just the *possibility* of all of it, packed into a rough brown case no larger than a Galah's eye.

The blue of the sky, squeezed past blue. Waiting.

He flew it to the stump. He pushed it into the crack where the cut wood met the living root — the root that was still in the ground, still connected to the old channels, still warm with the memory of two hundred years of conducting a song.

Then Cooroo screamed.

It was terrible. It was the worst scream he had ever produced — raw, cracked, graceless, the sound of a gate hinge in a cyclone, exactly the kind of noise that made other species cover their ears and wonder what they had done to deserve Galahs. It was not a Violet Call. It was not a frequency check. It was a juvenile bird with oversized resonating chambers, standing on the stump of the only tree he'd ever loved, screaming at a seed because a flower had taught him that the sky, pressed hard enough, turns lilac — and lilac is the colour of everything that refuses to be grey.

Three hundred metres south, on her low branch, Cooriki's crest rose.

She didn't fly to him. Not yet. But she turned her head toward the sound — the first movement she'd made toward anything in five weeks — and something in her face shifted. Not hope. Not yet. Something before hope. The thing that hope is made from, the way lilac is made from blue: the original material, compressed until it becomes something new.

The seed sat in its crack. The stump sat in its grief.

And somewhere on the rough edge of the Bad Grounds, a Morning Glory — *Ipomoea costata*, the Rock Glory, the Poison Glory, the native vine that grows in desert gravel and riverbeds and the rough margins where nothing else bothers — opened its lilac trumpet to the dawn and played a note that only a Galah could hear, in a colour that only a bird the same colour could understand.

## Tone Notes

**What changed from v1:**

1. **The narrator has personality.** Wry, affectionate, slightly amused. "Roughly the equivalent of a fish deciding it had gone off swimming." The narrator likes Cooroo and thinks the world is absurd and heartbreaking in equal measure.

2. **Concrete over abstract.** The lattice becomes "the Bad Grounds" — something Cooroo experiences physically (flat feathers, unease) rather than something the narrator explains cosmologically. No references to "fractal," "crystalline order," or "meta-narrative" in the prose itself. The ideas are there; the vocabulary is Cooroo's, not the wiki's.

3. **Shorter paragraphs.** More white space. The eye moves faster. Emotional beats land in single lines rather than embedded in long passages.

4. **Humour as load-bearing structure.** The jokes aren't decoration — they carry the characterisation. "Galahs move like small pink commuters late for a train" tells you more about the species than a paragraph of mythology.

5. **Emotion through understatement.** Cooriki's grief is shown as a fixed stare and a refusal to move — not described as "the loss of the prophetic faculty." The reader feels it because the detail is specific, not because the narrator has explained why they should feel it.

6. **The metaphysics emerge from action.** The condensed-sky concept arrives when Cooroo *sees* the flower, not when the narrator *explains* the theory. "Blue, squeezed, becomes lilac" is a physical observation by a character, not a cosmological statement by an omniscient voice.

7. **Rowling's trick: the small specific detail that carries the weight.** The warmth of the stump is "like the last heat in a mug of tea after the tea is gone." The seed "couldn't give a toss about aesthetics." The heartwood pile "smells of tannin and old tea and the particular sweetness of a thing decomposing in the direction of usefulness." These are the details that make a world feel lived-in rather than designed.

**What to watch:**

- The Rowling register risks losing the saga's mythic weight. The v1 prose has a prophetic grandeur that suits the meta-narrative and the lore documents. The v2 register suits *stories* — scenes with characters moving through space and time. The saga may need both registers: mythic for the constants/lore, warm-close for the stories.

- Cooroo's voice and the narrator's voice are close in this register. That's a feature for his stories (he's optimistic, wry, slightly ridiculous — a natural Rowling protagonist). It may not suit stories told from Pokero's or Hoebat's perspective, which might need a different shade of the same warmth.
