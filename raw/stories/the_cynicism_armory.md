## The Drip Seminar

The Glow Room had mirrors.

This was not decorative. Tatebat had personally installed them — salvaged glass from the surface, polished with compounds that **[[../characters/antagonists#Muskbat (The Tech/Batman)|Muskbat's]]** tech-waste produced as a byproduct. The mirrors lined every wall, angled so that no matter where you stood, you saw yourself from at least three directions. When Tatebat walked through the Glow Room, he was surrounded by an infinite procession of himself. This was the point.

"Image," Tatebat told his recruits on their first day, "is the only infrastructure that doesn't crack."

The air in the Glow Room smelled of eucalyptus oil — the expensive kind, distilled three times, not the raw Lyptus the **[[../lore#The Fall of the Primes & The Rise of Jacaranda|Koala labs]]** pushed on the desperate. Tatebat didn't do desperate. Tatebat did *premium*. The oil was diffused through the ventilation at exactly the concentration required to make the room smell like possibility without tipping into intoxication.

Twelve young wombats stood in a line. They were between sixteen and twenty — the age when a wombat's body is finishing its growth and its mind is desperate for someone to tell it what shape to become. They wore what they'd arrived in: standard-issue Lo Snout work tunics, frayed at the hem, stained with the grey chalk of the dig-face. They looked, in the mirrors, exactly like what they were — tunnel workers with dirty paws and no future that didn't involve a shovel.

Tatebat entered through the back. He didn't walk — he *arrived*, the way weather arrives, changing the atmospheric pressure of the room before anyone saw the source. He wore the purple velvet harness with the gold-leaf trim. The wide-brimmed hat — recycled from a "Warning: Excavation" sign, but you'd never know it because the recycling was art. The cane — polished **Safety Yellow** hydraulic line, tipped with a cubic wombat-poo diamond that caught the mirror-light and scattered it into twelve pairs of astonished eyes.

"Look at you," Tatebat said. His voice was not loud. It was *warm* — a bass vibration that bypassed the ears and went directly to the part of the brain that wanted to be liked. "Look. At. You."

He walked the line. Not inspecting — *appraising*. The difference was crucial. An inspector finds faults. An appraiser finds value. Tatebat looked at each recruit the way a jeweller looks at an uncut stone — seeing not what it was, but what it could sell for.

"You came here because the Grotto is grey. Because the tunnels are grey. Because your tunics are grey and your food is grey and your future is a grey line from the dig-face to the dormitory and back until the ceiling falls on you or the **[[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monsters]]** grind through your bedroom."

He paused at the centre of the line. Removed his hat. Held it at his side so the mirror-light caught the gold trim and threw a warm glow across the nearest recruits' faces.

"I'm here to tell you that grey is a choice."

### The Upgrade

The seminar was not about fighting. Tatebat left fighting to **[[../characters/antagonists#Vitabat (The Enforcer)|Vitabat]]** — the Enforcer, the Collector, the wombat who turned debts into bruises. Tatebat dealt in a different currency. He dealt in *want*.

"The problem with the Old Ways," Tatebat said, circling the line, his cane tapping the mirror-floor in a rhythm that made the recruits' feet want to move, "is not that they don't work. The problem is that they're ugly. Your grandmothers packed clay with their bare paws and called it 'tradition.' I call it a branding failure."

He stopped in front of a recruit — a stocky wombat named Drenn, eighteen, with wide shoulders and a face that looked like it had been assembled from spare parts by someone who cared about function but not presentation.

"You," Tatebat said. "What do you do?"

"Dig, sir. Sector 8 day crew."

"Dig. And what do you get for digging?"

"Rations. Dormitory bunk. Access to the water station."

Tatebat turned to the mirrors. Twelve reflections of himself and twelve reflections of a wombat who had just described his entire existence in nine words, none of which included joy, beauty, or the faintest suggestion that being alive was worth the effort.

"Rations," Tatebat repeated, letting the word fall flat. "Brother Drenn, I can get a machine to dig. A Yellow Monster digs better than any wombat alive. The machine doesn't need rations. Doesn't need a bunk. So what is the *value* of a wombat who digs?"

Drenn opened his mouth. Closed it.

"Zero," Tatebat said. "In the economy that *Trumbat* built, the economy of walls and Safety Grout and 'Dig Here, Stay Here, Die Here' — your value is zero. You're not even a number. You're a function. A verb. 'Dig.' No noun. No *name*."

He leaned close to Drenn. Close enough that Drenn could smell the eucalyptus oil and the leather of the harness and something else — something warm and dangerous that wasn't a scent but a *promise*.

"But in *my* economy — the economy of the Glow — a wombat's value is not what he *does*. It's how he *looks* doing it."

He stepped back. Snapped his fingers. From the shadows behind the mirrors, two of Tatebat's "stable" — young wombats who had graduated from previous seminars and now served as living advertisements — emerged carrying boxes. Inside: clothing. Not work tunics. Not Council-issue. Actual garments — dyed, tailored, embellished. Purple and gold. The colours of the Jacaranda.

"Put them on," Tatebat said.

The recruits hesitated. In Melborow, clothing beyond the work tunic was a luxury that most Lo Snouts encountered only in the Cathedral gift shop, priced in Root-Credits they would never earn.

"Put. Them. On."

They put them on. And the mirrors — the mirrors that had shown them grey diggers in grey tunics in a grey room — showed them something else. Something that had colour. Something that looked, in the manufactured light of the Glow Room, almost like the surface. Almost like the sky. Almost like creatures who mattered.

Drenn stared at his reflection. His wide shoulders, which had always looked like a burden, looked powerful in the tailored vest. His rough paws, which had always been tools, looked deliberate inside the embroidered gloves.

"That," Tatebat said, pointing at the mirror, "is the only wall that matters. The one between who you are and who they *see*. Trumbat builds walls out of grout. I build them out of *light*."

### The Cost

No one asked about the cost. Not during the seminar. Tatebat had learned long ago that the worst time to discuss price was when the customer was still dazzled. You let the glow settle. You let them walk the corridors in their new colours and feel the eyes of the Grotto turn toward them — the Lo Snout mothers who paused, the shift bosses who noticed, the other young wombats who looked and *wanted*.

The cost came later. Quietly. In the form of a visit from one of Tatebat's "managers" — a wombat who explained, in the smooth and reasonable tones of a creature who had been trained to make exploitation sound like partnership, that the clothing was not a gift. It was an investment. And investments require returns.

The returns were simple: visibility. Tatebat's recruits became his *display*. They walked the Grotto in purple and gold, and every wombat who saw them saw not a Lo Snout digger but a *brand*. Tatebat's brand. The brand said: *The grey is optional. The suffering is a choice. Come to the Glow Room and I will show you the light.*

And they came. By the dozen. By the hundred. Young wombats who were drowning in the Great Thirst and who grabbed at the golden life-preserver that Tatebat threw them, not realizing that the rope attached to it led directly to his paw.

The gold chains were still chains. But in the dark, chains that glitter look like jewellery.

## The Private Hour

The Glow Room emptied. The last recruit's footsteps faded, the new boots clicking against the mirror-floor with the self-conscious rhythm of a creature learning to walk differently because walking differently meant being seen differently.

Tatebat waited. Counted to sixty. Checked the corridor. Empty.

Then Tatebat removed the hat.

Without it, his head looked wrong. Not vulnerable — Tatebat had spent years ensuring that no part of him looked vulnerable — but *incomplete*. As if the hat was not an accessory but a load-bearing structure, and without it, the architecture of his persona sagged.

He removed the harness. The gold-leaf trim — which in the mirror-light looked like treasure — was, in the dim service lighting, clearly painted tin. The purple velvet was real, but it was wearing thin at the seams. The cane's diamond was polished cubic poo, which was worth exactly nothing outside the Glow Room's manufactured economy.

Without the costume, Tatebat was a wombat. A mid-sized, slightly overweight, middle-aged wombat with fur that was going grey at the muzzle and paws that — if you looked closely, which no one was ever allowed to — were not the manicured display pieces he presented to the world. They were scarred. Work scars. The kind you get from digging.

### The Child in the Glow

He had been twelve.

Not the outer ring of Deep Arnamland, where the walls were thin — the *middle* ring, where the walls were thick enough to give the illusion of permanence but not thick enough to survive the truth. His mother worked the Sector 4 day crew. His father was a number in Vitabat's ledger — a wombat who had taken a Root-Loan to repair the family borow and had been "collected" when he couldn't pay. The collection was not metaphorical.

Young Tatebat had grown up in a tunnel where the walls were cracked and the ceiling leaked and the only colour was grey and the only sound was the **[[../lore#The New Ways (The Melborow Frequency)|Frequency]]** humming its synthetic lullaby of *everything is fine, everything is fine, everything is fine*.

Everything was not fine.

The first time he saw colour was in the Cathedral gift shop. His mother had taken him on a "field trip" — a Council program that brought Lo Snout children to the upper levels to see how the High-Noses lived, which was supposed to inspire them but actually functioned as a demonstration of everything they would never have. The gift shop sold trinkets: painted stones, fake Jacaranda flowers, miniature replicas of the Wall.

And in the corner, on a dusty rack that no one ever touched because the price was absurd: a purple scarf.

Tatebat stared at it. Not because he wanted a scarf. Because the colour — violet, rich, alive — was the first thing he had ever seen that didn't look like it was dying. In a world of grey tunnel and grey tunic and grey rations, the scarf was a window into the possibility that beauty existed and could be touched.

He didn't steal it. He couldn't afford it. He stood and stared until his mother pulled him away and the Cathedral guard closed the gift shop and the purple faded into another thing he couldn't have.

That night, in his cracked borow, Tatebat made a decision that would define everything that followed. He would never be grey again. Not because grey was wrong — grey was honest, grey was the colour of the earth, grey was his mother's paws after a twelve-hour shift. But because grey was *invisible*. And invisible meant unprotected. And unprotected meant his father, collected by a wombat in a suit, disappeared into the ledger, reduced to a number that Zuckbat would later file and forget.

If the world was a cage, Tatebat would be the shiniest thing in it. So bright that no one would notice the bars.

### The Repair on the Wall

Tatebat opened his eyes. The Glow Room was dim, the mirrors reflecting only his uncostumed self — a wombat sitting on a floor that, without the lights, was just grey grout.

He stood, stretched the performance out of his shoulders — the permanent tension of a creature whose body was always *on*, always projecting, always manufacturing the glow that kept the darkness at bay — and walked to the back wall to retrieve his hat.

He stopped.

There, on the wall of the Glow Room — *his* wall, in *his* space, the one room in Melborow where he controlled every reflection — was a patch.

Clay. Real clay. River-stone flecked, warm to the touch, packed with the rhythmic compression of the **[[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Old Ways]]**. It covered a crack that Tatebat had noticed three weeks ago and covered with a mirror because covering things with something shiny was his entire theology.

He peeled the mirror away. The patch was beneath it — warm, organic, unpainted. It didn't glow. It didn't shine. It was grey. The honest grey of actual earth, packed by actual paws, doing the actual work of holding up a ceiling.

Hoebat's work. The Ghost. Here. In the Glow Room.

Tatebat pressed his bare paw against the patch. Felt the pulse. The warmth. A real repair, performed by a real wombat, solving a real problem with real dirt. No branding. No mirrors. No purple.

He knew he should report it. The Council had standing orders: any unauthorized structural modification was to be flagged to Zuckbat's ledger team immediately. Trumbat would call it sabotage. Muskbat would call it "an unoptimized intervention." Vitabat would send someone to collect.

Tatebat looked up. The crack the patch covered ran directly into the load-bearing junction above the Glow Room's main chamber — the junction that supported his ceiling, his mirrors, his twelve recruits who stood in this room every night and learned to shine because he told them it was the only armour that worked.

The Ghost's repair was holding up his ceiling.

Tatebat removed his paw from the patch. He picked up the mirror. Looked at it. Looked at the grey clay beneath it. The shiny surface and the honest dirt. The glow and the ground.

He set the mirror aside. Left the patch exposed.

Then he put on his hat, his harness, his cane. Became the Pimp again — the silhouette, the brand, the Glittering Lid that made the cage look like a palace. He walked out of the Glow Room, purple and gold, the door sealing behind him with a sound like a display case closing.

And the patch stayed on the wall — warm, grey, unpainted, un-mirrored — holding up the ceiling of the room where young wombats learned to shine because no one had ever taught them that the shiniest things in the dark are often the most afraid of it.
