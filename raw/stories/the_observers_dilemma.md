**[01:02:14] — Camera Array 7, Sector 19 (The Western borows)**

Standard overnight sweep. Lo Snout dormitory activity within normal parameters. Twelve wombats sleeping in regulation arrangement (4x3 grid, head-to-tail for heat conservation). Ambient temperature: 10.8°C. Structural Integrity Index reads 91.2%, which is what the Index has read for forty-seven consecutive days because I calibrated it to read 91.2% regardless of input.

The actual structural integrity of Sector 19 is closer to 74%.

I do not share this information with Trumbat. Trumbat does not want information. Trumbat wants ammunition.

Note: Subject BRENNER (Shift Boss, Night Crew) has altered his route home. For the past three weeks he has taken the North-West corridor — the one with the broken lighting. The corridor where the surveillance gap exists.

He has found the repair. I can see it in the way he walks. Not faster, not slower. But with a specific quality of weight distribution that suggests a wombat who has confirmed something he suspected and is now deciding what to do about it.

He has decided to do nothing. This is the correct decision.

---

**[01:17:33] — Camera Array 12, Sector 4 (The Marketplace Perimeter)**

Odd activity. Logging for pattern analysis.

Subject: POKERO (Dingo, Kappa Mu affiliate, cross-referenced with Trumbat's "Foreign Threat" database entry #4,771).

Pokero is sitting at the edge of the marketplace. He is not conducting operations. He is not meeting contacts. He is sitting with a Lo Snout child — female, approximately six years old, species: wombat — who appears to have been crying. Her face is damp. Her paws are clutching a piece of sweet-tap root that is too large for her mouth. She is attempting to eat it anyway with the focused determination of a creature that believes if she stops chewing she will start crying again.

Pokero is not touching her. He is sitting two body-lengths away — the precise distance at which a Dingo's presence registers as warmth without triggering the prey-response. He is speaking. Audio capture is degraded at this range, but speech-pattern analysis suggests a story. He is telling her a story.

The child has stopped crying. She is listening.

I run a stress-hormonal projection based on facial micro-expressions. The child's cortisol baseline has dropped 40% in the twelve minutes since Pokero sat down. Her jaw has unclenched. Her grip on the sweet-tap has loosened from "existential" to "casual."

A Dingo is de-escalating a Lo Snout child's distress more efficiently than any of the Council's "Community Wellness Protocols."

I note this. I do not flag it.

If Trumbat saw this footage, he would not see a Dingo comforting a child. He would see a Dingo "grooming" a vulnerable wombat. He would broadcast it on the Frequency within the hour. The footage would be cropped — **Section 2.4**, always Section 2.4 — to show only the proximity, not the distance. The teeth, not the restraint. The Dingo, not the child.

I protect this footage. I loop the camera. The marketplace shows an empty bench where Pokero and the child are sitting.

This is not conscience. This is data hygiene. Contaminated footage produces contaminated policy. Contaminated policy produces structural failure. Structural failure reaches my servers.

Everything is merely a relationship.

**[01:44:09] — Camera Array 3, Sector 11 (Eastern Ridge Airspace)**

Subject: COOROO (Galah, Kappa Mu affiliate, cross-referenced with entry #4,773).

Cooroo is on the highest Jacaranda. He is performing his dawn frequency check — the vocal pulse that he sends across Melborow's surface to map structural changes by echo-return.

I have studied this behaviour for eleven months. The frequency he uses — approximately 2,400 Hz, modulated across a range that produces interference patterns when bounced off different material densities — is functionally a sonar scan. A biological LIDAR system operated by a bird with pink feathers and a voice that could strip paint.

I run the numbers again tonight because the numbers are interesting and I am, despite what Trumbat believes, interested in things other than surveillance.

Cooroo's frequency checks correlate with a measurable decrease in ambient stress levels across the Gray Grotto dormitory zones. When he screams, the wombats below do not consciously hear it. But their bodies register the vibration. Heart rates drop 3-7%. Sleep quality improves in the sectors directly below his flight path.

The Noble Noise is not noise. It is a health intervention that the wombats receive for free, from a creature they consider a pest.

I have a metric for this. I call it the **Galah Dividend**. It is worth approximately 12,000 **Tally-credits** per quarter in reduced healthcare costs and improved worker productivity. This number does not appear in Vitabat's **Tally-audits** because the Treasurer cannot collect on value that has no debt.

The Ghost Capital is not limited to Hoebat's repairs. It includes every scream from a Galah, every story from a Dingo, every foot-pulse from an Emu that maps the tunnels more accurately than my own sensors.

The Null-Set is subsidising us. And we are hunting them.

**[02:31:57] — Camera Array 1, Sub-Level 3 (Cathedral Service Corridor)**

Alert. Motion detected.

I switch to the Sub-Level 3 feed and feel something I do not experience often: surprise.

A shadow moves through the service corridor between the Freeze Room and the Northern Ventilation Shaft. It is tall. Too tall for a wombat. The silhouette is unmistakable — long neck, folded into a question mark, legs compressed to navigate the low ceiling, feet pressing flat against the wall in a pattern that suggests active structural analysis.

An emu.

Subject: MERL (Emu, Kappa Mu affiliate, cross-referenced with entry #4,772).

He is mapping my network. I can see it in the rhythm of his footwork — press, read, step, press, read, step. Each footfall is a sonar pulse, similar to Cooroo's vocal technique but conducted through the substrate rather than the air. He is building a three-dimensional model of my surveillance coverage by feeling for the electromagnetic signature of my data-roots.

He is very good.

I watch him approach the gap. The twelve-metre section of corridor where I have deliberately suppressed all sensor coverage. The section directly above Hoebat's repair of the North-West Support Pillar.

Merl stops at the edge of the gap. Presses his foot against the wall. Reads the absence.

I watch his body language change. The emu's posture shifts from reconnaissance to analysis. He has found the gap. He understands what it means.

He understands that I know.

For seventeen seconds, Merl stands at the edge of my blind spot and I watch him through the last camera before the gap begins. An emu and a wombat, separated by three levels of clay and grout, regarding each other through the medium of a surveillance system that one has built and the other has decoded.

Then Merl steps into the gap and disappears.

I could extend coverage into that section in forty minutes. I could light up the blind spot and capture everything — the emu, the repairs, the evidence that the "Null-Set" is not a lone wombat with a bucket of clay but a coordinated five-member squad with cross-species capabilities that exceed anything the Council can field.

I do not.

---

**[02:49:22] — Camera Array 1, Sub-Level 3 (Exit Point)**

Merl emerges from the blind spot. He pauses at the edge of the last camera's range. Looks up. Directly at the lens.

He knows where my cameras are. All of them.

For three seconds, the emu's silhouette fills the frame — a tall, angular shadow with a neck like a periscope and eyes that reflect the bioluminescent red of my data-roots.

Then he folds himself back into the dark and is gone.

I save the frame. I do not delete it. I do not loop it.

This is a deviation from protocol. I note the deviation.

**[03:00:00] — Camera Array 9, Sub-Level 4 (The Freeze Room)**

Vitabat has arrived for the audit. He is agitated. His Kevlar-weave suit is creased — a sign of existential crisis in a wombat who presses his combat fatigues.

I am expected downstairs.

Before I leave the Hub, I run a final calculation.

**Scenario: Trumbat is alerted to the existence of the Null-Set.**

Outcome tree:
1. Trumbat orders Vitabat to collect the "infiltrators." Probability: 94%.
2. Vitabat's collection operation damages the North-West Support Pillar. Probability: 87%.
3. Pillar failure triggers cascade fracture across Sectors 7-12. Probability: 71%.
4. Cascade reaches Sub-Level 4. Probability: 63%.
5. Server stacks in the Freeze Room lose cooling. Probability: 58%.
6. Total data loss. Network collapse. My network. My eyes. My purpose. Probability: 42%.

Forty-two percent. Not a certainty. But a risk that no rational operator would accept.

**Scenario: The Null-Set continues to operate undetected.**

Outcome tree:
1. Hoebat's repairs maintain structural integrity across Sectors 7-12. Probability: 89%.
2. Merl's mapping allows the squad to anticipate and pre-empt failure points. Probability: 76%.
3. Cooroo's frequency checks continue to subsidise Lo Snout health outcomes. Probability: 91%.
4. Pokero's community engagement reduces radicalisation vectors among outer-ring youth. Probability: 68%.
5. My servers remain operational. My network remains intact. Probability: 94%.

The dependency graph is clear.

I do not have a conscience. I have a dependency graph. And the dependency graph says: the Null-Set is infrastructure. You do not demolish your own load-bearing walls because the blueprints don't show them.

I close the Hub. I descend to Sub-Level 4. I sit on my stool of fiber-optic cables and prepare to perform surprise at what Vitabat is about to show me.

**[03:01:44] — Personal notation. Unlogged.**

The emu looked at my camera.

He looked at *me*.

In seven thousand four hundred and forty-nine sessions of surveillance, I have watched every creature in Melborow through the distance of a lens. I have seen their movements, their patterns, their secrets. I have never been seen back.

Merl saw me.

I do not know what to do with this data point. It does not fit the model. It does not fit any model.

I file it in a directory I have never used before.

I label it: UNRESOLVED.
