# The One Who Ran

The tunnel didn't smell like the borow. It smelled of old fear and ozone.

Hoebat had ventured deeper than the **Four-Foot Rule** allowed, following a vibration that felt like a sobbing earth. He found himself in a forgotten sector, where the walls were not smooth clay, but jagged, weeping rock.

Something moved in the shadows.

"Go back!" a voice rasped, sounding like gravel grinding against bone. "The Grout is setting! You can't be here!"

Hoebat squinted. "Who's there? I'm just—"

The attack was a blur of gray fur and desperation.

The stranger launched himself from a ledge, hitting Hoebat with the weight of a falling boulder. It was a sloppy tackle, but heavy. Hoebat rolled, his back hitting the hard floor, claws scrambling for purchase.

The attacker was old. His fur was matted with blue moss, his eyes wild and milky. But his grip was iron. He pinned Hoebat's shoulders, baring teeth that had been ground down to stumps.

"They sealed it!" the old wombat screamed, spittle flying. "They sealed the ramp! Why are you smiling? TRUMBAT IS WATCHING!"

Hoebat kicked out, catching the stranger in the stomach. The old wombat grunted but didn't let go. He raised a claw to strike, but as he did, his left shoulder popped with a sickening *clunk*. The arm went limp. The old wombat howled, not in anger, but in a dazzling, white-hot pain that made him collapse sideways.

Hoebat didn't run. He scrambled up, panting, and looked down.

The stranger was curling into a ball, clutching his left arm. The shoulder joint was visibly wrong—swollen, misaligned, a chronic injury that had never healed properly.

"It popped," the stranger whimpered, rocking back and forth. "Just like the drain. Always the drain."

Hoebat's anger evaporated. He saw the way the old wombat held himself—the defensive curl of a **Karst-Mu** who had no wall to brace against.

"Let me see it," Hoebat said softly, stepping forward.

"No! Safety is absolute! Don't touch the structure!"

"I'm not the Safety Crew," Hoebat said, his voice firm. He placed a paw on the stranger's good shoulder. "I'm a mender. Hold still."

He moved with the instinct of his mother's lineage. He felt the tension in the old muscle, the scar tissue of a decades-old dislocation.

"Breathe," Hoebat commanded.

"Heroes don't breathe..." the stranger whispered.

"We do today."

Hoebat pulled. Then he twisted. *Snap.*

The joint slid back into place. The old wombat gasped, his whole body shuddering as the tension released. He lay there for a long time, staring at the ceiling of the cave.

"The pain..." the stranger murmured. "It stopped."

"It's just a dislocation," Hoebat said, sitting back. "I'm Hoebat. Who are you?"

The stranger looked at him. The madness in his eyes had receded, replaced by a deep, hollow sorrow. He rubbed his shoulder, the one that worked again.

"They call me Rokenbat," he said. "But once... I was Karst-Mu. I was there, boy. At the Wall."

Hoebat's ears perked up. "The Eternal Brace? My father says—"

"Your father tells you about heroes," Rokenbat interrupted, spitting on the floor. "He tells you Gornbat shouted 'For the State.' He tells you we chose the stone."

He sat up, leaning close. "I will tell you what really happened. I will tell you about the mix."

---

"Trumbat knew," Rokenbat began, his voice dropping to a whisper. "He knew the **The Grout** was too heavy for the forms. He didn't build the wall to hold the earth; he built the wall to hold *us*."

Hoebat listened as the old warrior spoke of the crack, the terror, and the missing ramp.

"We ran," Rokenbat confessed, tears leaking from his milky eyes. "Gornbat saw the exit was sealed. He didn't scream for glory. He screamed for survival. 'Hold!' he roared. 'If we don't brace, we're crushed!'"

"So they braced," Hoebat said, picturing the statues in the plaza.

"They braced because they had to," Rokenbat nodded. "They locked their scapulae. They became the lattice. But I... I saw a gap. A storm drain, barely wide enough for a rat."

He rubbed his healed shoulder. "Cowardice makes you small, boy. That is the only magic I know. I squeezed. I dislocated this shoulder to fit. I crawled into the shit and the runoff while the gray sludge rose around my brothers' waists."

Hoebat felt a chill that had nothing to do with the cave damp. "You left them."

"I heard Gornbat scream," Rokenbat whispered. "It wasn't a battle cry. It was the sound of a spine snapping under the weight of a mountain. And then... silence. Just the wet slap of the Grout filling the void."

"When I came out, I was in the Garden District. The sky was blue. Everyone was cheering for the 'Ascended Heroes.' And I... I was the only one who knew the recipe."

Rokenbat looked at Hoebat, his eyes pleading for judgment, or perhaps forgiveness.

"Sand. Water. Lime. And the betrayed bones of the believers."

Hoebat sat in silence for a long time. He looked at his own paws—paws that had just healed a breaker of oaths.

"You aren't a coward," Hoebat said finally.

"I ran."

"You survived," Hoebat corrected. "And because you survived, the truth survived. If you had stayed... Trumbat's lie would be the only thing holding up that ceiling."

Rokenbat wept then. It wasn't a noble sound. It was ugly and raw, the sound of a vibration finally finding its way into the earth.

Hoebat stayed with him until the weeping stopped. Then he stood up.

"Can you walk, Rokenbat?"

The old wombat tested his legs. "Where are we going?"

"To the surface," Hoebat said, looking back the way he came. "My father needs to hear this story. And this time... he's going to listen."
