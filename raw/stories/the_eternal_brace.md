# The Eternal Brace

*It was a Tuesday, and Hoebat was refusing to eat his dehydrated root-cubes again. Cornelibat adjusted his monocle, sighed a sigh that had been dry-aged for three generations, and pointed a claw at the ceiling.*

"You complain about the texture," Cornelibat said, his voice thick with gravel. "But do you know *why* the ceiling stays up, boy? Do you know why we sleep without fear of the sky falling on our heads?"

Hoebat poked a cube. "Because of physics, Dad."

"Physics!" Cornelibat scoffed. "Physics is a Dingo word. Physics is what happens when things fall down. Order is what keeps them up. And do you know who purchased that Order?"

Hoebat rolled his eyes. "The Council?"

"No. Heroes. Wombats with spines stiffer than your attitude. I am speaking, of course, of the **Karst-Mu**."

---

The deal was absolute. **Trumbat (The Grand Architect)** didn't offer the Karst-Mu money (**Tally-credits** hadn't been invented yet). He offered them the only thing a Defender actually wants: **Destiny.** And to honor their service, he promised them the **Golden Retirement**.

"When the wall is set," Trumbat promised, his voice filled with the weight of prophecy, "you will never have to hold a ceiling again. Every Karst-Mu will receive a deed to a surface-level borow in the new Garden Districts—sectors so structurally sound that your children will think 'roof' is just another word for 'sky.' You will be given mates from the Soft-Earth clans—wombats with paws that have never known the stress of a fracture. You will raise families who sleep through the night without listening for the crack."

"The ceiling is getting heavier," Trumbat continued, not with arrogance, but with the quiet sorrow of a leader burdened by necessity. "The Static is drying out the deep loam. The earth is becoming brittle. And to yield the Resonance we need, the Rain Pools must expand. The old bracing cannot support the new instability. I have a design for a brace that will never yield. It will hold the sky up forever."

Elder **Gornbat** — the last true Karst-Mu master — had looked at Trumbat's blueprints. They were beautiful. Straight lines. Hard corners. A testament to Order.

"This is not a brace," Gornbat whispered, tapping the charcoal drawing with reverence. "This is a temple."

"It is a temple that requires saints," Trumbat said softly. "I need your strength to hold the forms while the holy grout sets. The earth will try to crush it before it hardens. I need the Karst-Mu to do what only you can do: stand where the ceiling is lowest."

It wasn't a pitch. It was an invitation to greatness. The Karst-Mu lived to serve the structure. And Trumbat was offering them the ultimate service. They agreed without hesitation.

---

For three months, the Karst-Mu held the line.

They stood in the deep trenches — five hundred wombats, shoulder to shoulder, paws pressed against the shuddering mud walls of the Great Excavation. They performed the **The Listening Stance**, a technique older than the First Fracture. It was not a static stance. It was a lattice.

Each Karst-Mu locked their rear claws into the soil and pressed their broad, flat scapula against the wombat next to them. The force of the collapsing earth didn't hit a single body; it was distributed instantly through the chain of five hundred skeletons, dissipating into the ground like a lightning strike hitting a rod.

They learned this in **"The Drop"** — a brutal apprenticeship where novices stood in a collapsing tunnel and learned to shift their weight at the exact frequency of the falling stone. If you fought the stone, you broke a bone. If you matched its rhythm, you became the stone. A master Karst-Mu didn't hold the wall up; they convinced the wall that it was already supported.

It was glorious work. Trumbat walked the line every day, bringing water, blessing their paws, reminding them that they were the heroes of the New Way.

---

The shift didn't happen with a whistle. It happened with a crack.

On the ninety-ninth day, the wall was almost done. Only the "Yielding Gaps" remained — the spaces the Karst-Mu were holding open so the earth could breathe.

The pumps started pouring the final layer of The Grout — the fast-setting, airless mix that Trumbat had perfected to save the deeper borows. But the mix was too heavy for the incomplete forms. The earth groaned. A hairline fracture appeared in the main buttress, right above the nursery sector where the Soft-Earth clans were sleeping.

"The forms are failing!" Trumbat screamed from the lip of the trench. His face wasn't triumphant; it was terrified for his people. "If the wall breaks now, the whole sector dies! Evacuate! Get to the ramps!"

Elder Gornbat looked at the crack. He looked at his team. He looked at the exit ramp, where Trumbat was gesturing frantically for them to save themselves.

If they left, the wall fell. The nursery died. The dream of the Garden Districts would be buried in rubble.

If they stayed, the wall held.

Gornbat didn't look up at Trumbat with fear. He looked up with understanding.

"Hold the gap!" Gornbat roared, his voice steady as the earth itself. "For the State! For the kin! For Trumbat!"

The Karst-Mu didn't scramble for the ramps. They dug in. They performed the **Eternal Brace**, locking their joints against the crushing weight of the The Grout. They chose to become the living Iron-Bark that the grout needed to survive.

The grout rose. It was heavy, wet, and relentlessly logical. It filled the gaps between the Karst-Mu. It filled the space between their legs. It swaddled them in purpose.

Gornbat felt the pressure stabilize. The fracture above the nursery sealed. The wall was holding, but only because it had bones.

"We are the foundation," Gornbat whispered, the sludge reaching his chest.

Trumbat fell to his knees at the edge of the trench, tears streaming down his white fur. "You are the foundation," he wept. "And I am merely the architect who is unworthy of you. Together, we are the State."

---

The Karst-Mu didn't die. That is a lie told by the cynical. They ascended. They entered the **Stone-Sleep**, knowing their sacrifice had purchased safety for generations.

Deep inside the base of the Great Retaining Wall, beneath thousands of tonnes of Safety Grout, there is a layer called "The Gornbat Strata." If you press your ear against it, you can hear a faint, rhythmic thrumming.

It isn't the settling of stone.

It is the heartbeat of the greatest patriots Arnamland has ever known. They are still holding the ceiling. They are waiting for nothing. They are exactly where they chose to be.

Holding up the world.

*Cornelibat leaned back, wiping a speck of moisture from his eye. (It was dust, of course. Cornelibat did not cry.)*

"So you see," Cornelibat said, tapping the table. "They didn't complain about the pressure. They didn't ask why the roots were moving. They held the line. And because they held the line, you get to sit here and be a brat about your dinner."

Hoebat looked at his plate. He pushed the cube of tuber. It still looked like dust.

"But Dad," Hoebat whispered. "If they're still in there... can they breathe?"

Cornelibat stood up, ending the conversation with the abruptness of a closed door.

"Heroes don't think about breathing, Hoebat," Cornelibat said, his voice softer now, almost wistful. "They think about what they are holding up. They held their breath so that we could have a floor. The least you can do... is hold your spoon."
