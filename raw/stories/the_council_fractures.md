**Time:** Day Two. 22:00. The Emergency Session.

---

The Emergency Session Chamber was the only room in the Cathedral without surveillance. Zuckbat had designed it that way — not out of respect for privacy, but because a room where the Five Sovereigns spoke openly needed to be a room where the Five Sovereigns could later deny what they had said. Deniability required the absence of record. The absence of record was the last gift a **Tally-keeper** could give to the powerful.

The chamber was circular, carved from the bedrock that predated Melborow. The walls were unfinished stone — no Safety Grout, no clay-pack, no decoration. Five seats, arranged in a pentagon, each one carved from the same stone as the floor, so that sitting felt like being absorbed by the earth itself.

Trumbat was already seated when the others arrived. His mitre — shaped like a grout barrier, heavy enough to make his neck ache but vital to the liturgical silhouette — sat on the floor beside his chair. He never wore it in the Emergency Chamber because the ceiling was too low. Without the mitre, his head looked oddly exposed. An albino wombat — the most beautiful wombat most creatures had ever seen — radiant white fur and deep purple eyes that missed nothing, half-closed in that mellow, priestly expression that made every sermon feel like a lullaby.

Muskbat arrived second in his black exo-suit of recycled tech-waste, twitching with the suppressed energy of a creature who processed reality faster than reality could keep up. He carried no tablet — the Emergency Chamber's stone walls blocked all wireless signals, which was why Muskbat hated it. Without his screens, he was a wombat with ideas and no way to project them. His nose twitched — three sharp clicks, left-right-left — the nervous tic that Lolaboo had once learned to read as "the signal is buffering."

Tatebat came third. He didn't sit. He stood behind his chair, one paw resting on his cane, his purple velvet catching the torchlight in a way that made even firelight look curated. His wide-brimmed hat cast his face in shadow, which was how Tatebat preferred it — you couldn't sell the glow if people could see the mechanics.

Vitabat entered fourth. His Kevlar-weave suit absorbed the torchlight rather than reflecting it. He moved with the precise, unhurried gait of a creature who had never needed to rush because the things he was coming for couldn't run. He sat in his designated seat, scarred paws flat on the stone arms of the chair, and waited.

Zuckbat came last. He always came last. A grey hoodie pulled up, eyes glowing faintly with the residual data of a creature who never fully disconnected. He carried a bark-bound **Tally** — physical, deliberate, the kind of record that fire could destroy but hackers couldn't. He placed it on the arm of his chair and opened it to a page that was already marked.

"The floor is cracking," Zuckbat said.

No preamble. The **Tally-keeper** did not believe in preamble. Preamble was unrecorded time, and unrecorded time was wasted time.

"The floor cracks," Trumbat replied, his voice a boulder rolling downhill, carrying the cadence of a sermon even in private. "Floors have always cracked. We pour more grout. The Great Retaining Wall—"

"The Great Retaining Wall is *causing* the cracks, Trumbat."

Silence. Not the Muskbat kind. The kind where a room full of powerful creatures realises that one of them has said the thing they all know and none of them want to hear.

Zuckbat opened his **Tally**. "The engineering reports — the real ones, not the ones Parrin sanitised for your pulpit — show seven cascade fracture lines radiating from the wall's foundation trench. The fractures follow the exact path of the unauthorized substrate reinforcements that were severed during excavation."

"The sabotage," Trumbat said.

"The *repairs*." Zuckbat's voice was the whispered poetry of a wombat who recorded everything and judged nothing — except when the data demanded judgement. "Those 'unauthorized modifications' that you declared sabotage in your sermon to Parrin? They are the only thing that has been preventing the cascade failure that is now actively occurring because *you* dug them up."

"You're telling me that the criminals who operated on my infrastructure without permission were actually—"

"Keeping your infrastructure from collapsing? Yes. I ran the numbers — both the structural data *and* the financial models. The 'Ghost Capital' — the structural surplus in Sectors 7 through 12 — was generated entirely by these unauthorized repairs. When the Silent Architecture was intact, the Grotto's structural load was distributed across a web of eleven interlocking reinforcement points. Your wall has severed four of them. The remaining seven are now absorbing 160% of their rated capacity."

"Then we reinforce the remaining seven—"

"With *what*?" Vitabat spoke for the first time. His voice was quiet — the kind of quiet that preceded collection. "Your Batch Seven grout? The mix that the foreman told Parrin was wrong and that Parrin ignored because you told him to ignore it?" He leaned forward, scarred paws gripping the arms of his chair. "The Great Retaining Wall is a liability, Trumbat. It's not retaining anything — it's a two-hundred-tonne deadweight sitting on a fracture line. Every hour it stays, I'm enforcing a debt that the physics can't pay."

Trumbat's face darkened — the deep crimson that his tailor had once tried to match for his vestments and been told that the colour of righteous fury was not a fashion choice.

"What do you propose, Vita?" His voice had dropped to the register he reserved for threats too serious for volume. "That we tear down the Great Retaining Wall? That I go out to the platform and tell three hundred Lo Snouts that the Great Retaining Wall I consecrated — the Great Retaining Wall that is protecting them from—"

"From what? From Dingoes?" Vitabat's scarred paw tapped the chair arm once. "The Dingoes aren't eating the foundations, Trumbat. They're getting rich off the **[[../lore#The Static (The Digital Fester)|Static Fields]]** and laughing at your sermons. *You* are eating the foundations."

Trumbat stood. His chair scraped against the stone floor with a sound like a coffin lid opening. "You watch your—"

"Gentlemen." Muskbat's voice slid into the gap at supersonic speed. "Perhaps we should optimise this dialogue. The structural data suggests a non-trivial probability of—"

"Musk." Tatebat, from behind his chair. One word, delivered with the warm authority of a wombat who understood that the most powerful voice in any room was the one that didn't need to shout. "Read the room, baby."

Muskbat's mouth closed. Even the tech-vigilante knew when the signal wasn't landing.

Tatebat stepped forward into the torchlight. The purple velvet shifted. The cane tapped once on the stone floor — a sound that somehow managed to be both casual and commanding.

"The Great Retaining Wall is up," he said. "Taking it down is a branding disaster. The Lo Snouts see it. They *feel* it. You tear it down, you tear down the last thing they believe in. You might as well tear down Trumbat's pulpit while you're at it." He twirled the cane. "So we don't tear it down. We *rebrand* it."

"Rebrand a structural catastrophe?" Zuckbat's monotone carried the faintest edge of disbelief.

"I rebrand everything, Zuck. You think these wombats in purple and gold know they're wearing painted tin? They think they're wearing *status*. The Great Retaining Wall cracks? We call it 'artisanal weathering.' The ceiling sags? We call it 'organic architecture.' You give me the Frequency for thirty minutes and I'll have every Lo Snout in the Grotto believing the cracks are a *feature*."

"The cracks are not a feature," Zuckbat said. "The cracks are a death sentence."

"How long?" Vitabat asked.

Zuckbat consulted his **Tally** — both columns, the structural and the financial, intertwined on the page in a script only he could read. "At current load — with the Human construction above continuing to add weight and the wall remaining in place — I estimate forty-eight to seventy-two hours before the fracture lines converge beneath Sector 10."

"Sector 10 is residential."

"Three hundred families."

Another silence. This one had the weight of stone.

"Zuckbat," Trumbat said, turning to the hooded figure. "You said you ran the numbers. What else do your books tell you?"

Zuckbat reached into his hoodie and produced a flat piece of bark — a printed still-frame, rendered from his surveillance footage. He placed it on the stone floor in the centre of the pentagon.

The image was grainy, lit by the bioluminescent red of the data-roots. It showed a section of the Cathedral's service corridor — Sub-Level 3, near the Northern Ventilation Shaft. And in the corridor, captured in the frame between one camera's range and the next, the unmistakable silhouette of an emu. Long neck folded, body compressed, feet pressed flat against the wall.

"The 'Ghost' who has been performing the unauthorized repairs is not a lone operator," Zuckbat said. "It is a coordinated unit. Cross-species. At minimum, the unit includes a wombat—" he pointed at the repair methodology "—an emu—" the silhouette "—and based on my **Tally correlations** — Static-Logic data patterns from the Western borows, aerial frequency anomalies, and signal intercepts consistent with relay-tunnel technology — a Dingo, a Galah, and a Wallaby."

"Kappa Mu," Muskbat whispered.

"The Initiation Squad," Zuckbat confirmed. "Five members. Five species. They are the source of the Ghost Capital. They are the architects of the Silent Architecture. And they are—"

He paused. Chose his next words with the care of a creature who understood that language, like a **Tally**, was permanent.

"They are not our enemies."

The room split.

Trumbat spoke first. "They are infiltrators. Foreign-species operatives who have been conducting unauthorized modifications to Sovereign infrastructure for three years. This is not a repair — it's an *occupation*."

"An occupation that is keeping the ceiling up," Zuckbat said.

"We are in debt to an entity we are actively trying to destroy," he continued, pressing the **Tally** open wider, both columns visible. "The Ghost Capital is not an error, Trumbat. It is a *subsidy*. An anonymous donation of labour that has maintained the solvency of every structure between Sector 7 and Sector 12. If we destroy the architects of that subsidy, we destroy the last structural redundancy between the Gray Grotto and collapse. And I will note every **Tally-credit** of the loss."

"Then we absorb the collapse," Vitabat said. The room turned to him. The Enforcer's voice was cold, clinical — the voice of a wombat who had calculated the cost of mercy and found it too expensive before. "Evacuate the Cathedral and the upper sub-levels. Reinforce the critical infrastructure. Secure the Glow Room and the Freeze Room. The Lo Snouts in Sector 10—"

"You would let three hundred families be buried," Zuckbat said.

"I would preserve the operational capacity of the Council," Vitabat replied, without blinking. "Operational capacity requires structure. Structure requires sacrifice. I've collected from wombats who couldn't pay their debts for ten years, Zuck. Don't lecture me about the cost of business."

"The sacrifice of those who cannot fight back is not business," Zuckbat said. "It is a rounding error. And I am the one who rounds, Vita. Do not presume to tell the **Tally** what to count."

Tatebat had been watching. He stood behind his chair, cane tucked under his arm, hat tilted at the angle that meant he was calculating — not numbers, the way Zuckbat calculated, but *audiences*. Every crisis was a stage, and Tatebat was always casting.

"Three hundred families," he said, rolling the phrase like a marble. "That's three hundred families who *see*. Three hundred families who remember. Three hundred families who, if they survive, will tell every Lo Snout in Melborow what the Council did when the ceiling came down." He smiled — the warm, devastating smile that had launched a thousand purple vests. "Or what the Council *didn't* do."

"What are you saying, Tate?" Trumbat growled.

"I'm saying the optics are garbage either way, Reverend. But there's a version where we come out looking like saviours. You want to find these ghosts? Good. Find them. Then *hire* them. Make the repair crew official. Put them in purple. Call it a 'Sovereign Infrastructure Initiative.' I'll run the campaign."

"You want to *brand* the Resistance?" Vitabat said, with the first trace of genuine emotion — something between disgust and grudging admiration.

"I want to *own* them. There's a difference."

Muskbat had retreated into abstraction. His eyes had gone distant, his twitching accelerating to a frequency that suggested either intense calculation or a complete disconnect from the present. The Frequency architect was losing signal.

"Perhaps," Muskbat said, his voice rapid and mechanical, "we could modulate the Frequency to—"

"To *what*, Musk?" Trumbat snapped. "Broadcast the fractures away? Optimise the cracks? Your Frequency cannot hold up a ceiling. It can barely hold up a conversation."

Muskbat fell silent. His exo-suit hummed faintly — the sound of a system running processes that no one had requested and no one could stop.

"Vote," Trumbat said. "The infiltrators. We find them. We destroy them. We reclaim Sovereign territory."

"Or we protect them," Zuckbat countered. "We acknowledge the Ghost Capital. We integrate the repairs into the official structural plan. We stop the Great Retaining Wall before it kills us all."

"That is heresy."

"That is arithmetic."

Trumbat looked at Vitabat. The alliance was old — Trumbat's sermons, Vitabat's collections. Earth and Water, faith and force. The Priest who defined the sin and the Enforcer who collected the penance.

"Vitabat," Trumbat said. "Find them. The Dingo first. He's been operating in the Static Fields — the Western borows. Collect him."

Vitabat nodded. One movement. The Kevlar-weave creaked.

Tatebat twirled his cane. "And when you bring them in, bring them to me. I'll make them useful."

"They won't *be* useful once Vita's done with them," Zuckbat said flatly.

Zuckbat closed his **Tally**. Stood. "You are ordering the destruction of the only infrastructure keeping this city alive. I will note this in the record."

"There is no record in this room," Trumbat said. "You designed it that way."

"There is always a record," Zuckbat said. "It's just a question of who keeps it." He pulled his hood up and walked out.

In the Emergency Session Chamber, Trumbat and Vitabat remained. And Tatebat, who leaned on his cane and looked at a wall of unfinished stone and saw, in its blankness, a surface waiting for a mural. And Muskbat, who sat in his exo-suit and twitched his nose and stared at the same wall and saw nothing he could code.

The Council had fractured.

Trumbat and Vitabat on one side — Earth and Water, the Priest and the Enforcer. Zuckbat walking away with his **Tally** — Wood, the record that outlasted all of them. Tatebat calculating the angle — Metal, the glow that worked every room. And Muskbat — Fire — burning too fast to see the cliff he was approaching, broadcasting silence to a frequency that no one was receiving.

Above the Cathedral, the Human construction site poured another floor.

Below the Cathedral, seven fracture lines crept toward convergence.

And in the space between — the thin, cracking stratum where an entire civilisation had built its home — the clock counted down in the language of stone under pressure, and the stone was running out of things to say.
