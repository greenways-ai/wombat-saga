## I. The Story of the King’s Roots (How the Wombat Stole the Wall)

In the days when the High-Noses first started pouring Grout, there was a Sovereign named **Borb the Builder**. Borb loved straight lines. He loved them so much he decided to build a wall around the best root-patch in the mid-latitudes, not because he needed the roots, but because he liked the idea of owning the square they grew in.

Borb hired **Lo-Snout labourers** to pour the wall. He stood over them with a clipboard and a measuring stick, shouting: *"Straight! Straighter! If it curves, it’s failure!"*

Now, there was a young Lo-Snout named **Wizzle**. Wizzle didn't like straight lines, and he didn't like Borb. But Wizzle was small, and Borb was enormous, and Borb had the Grout.

So Wizzle went to the Dust-Bearers and asked for help. They told him to dig deeper. He went to the Kangaroos. They told him to run a circuit. He went to the Dingoes. They offered to eat Borb for a fee Wizzle couldn't afford.

Finally, Wizzle sat by the wall-trench and thought. He looked at the Grout. It was grey, and heavy, and stupid. It went where you poured it and stayed where it landed.

Wizzle realized something: *The Grout is heavy, but the ground is heavier.*

The next day, Wizzle showed up to work with a limp. *"Oh, Sovereign Borb,"* he groaned. *"My back is broken from carrying your genius."*

Borb sneered. *"Weakness is inefficiency. Dig faster."*

*"I cannot dig,"* said Wizzle. *"But I can mix. And I have found a secret ingredient that makes the Grout dry twice as hard. It is called 'Air of the Void'."*

Borb’s ears perked up. *"Harder? Show me."*

Wizzle took a bucket of water and whispered into it. He whispered a lie. Then he poured the water into the Grout mixer. *"Now,"* he said, *"we must pour it immediately, before the Void escapes."*

They poured the wall. It was magnificent. Straight. Grey. Hard. Borb stood on top of it and declared himself King of the Root-Patch.

That night, it rained.

The "Air of the Void" Wizzle had whispered about was actually **salt**. Just ordinary salt from the Salt Pan. Wizzle had dissolved enough of it in the mix to mess with the chemical bond of the Grout.

When the rain hit, the salt dissolved again. The Grout didn't melt—it *expanded*. It puffed up like a souffle. The straight lines buckled. The perfect corners rounded. The wall didn't fall down; it *relaxed*. It slumped into a comfortable, curved berm that looked exactly like a natural hill.

The next morning, Borb came out to inspect his fortress and found a gentle slope covered in happy wombats eating his roots.

*"Who did this?"* he screamed. *"Who curved my wall?"*

Wizzle stood at the bottom, eating a particularly crunchy root. *"The ground did it, Sovereign,"* he said. *"It seems the earth prefers a pillow to a prison."*

Borb spent the rest of his life trying to sue the rain.

**The Lesson:** You don't have to break the wall. You just have to change the chemistry of what holds it together.

## II. The Wombat Who Sold the Sky

There was a time when the Koalas controlled the canopy so tightly that they started charging rent for shade. *"Premium Shadow,"* they called it. *"Filtered light for the discerning marsupial."*

A wombat named **Swindle** (ancestor of Tatebat, though don't tell him that) was sweating in the sun. He looked up at the Koalas dozing in their Premium Shadow and felt the injustice of it.

Swindle didn't fight. He didn't protest. He found a piece of polished mica in the creek bed—a shard of the Glass that had worked its way up.

He set up a stall in the middle of the hottest clearing. He put the mica on a velvet cushion. He put up a sign: **"OWN A PIECE OF THE BLUE."**

A Koala climbed down. *"What is this?"*

*"This,"* said Swindle, *"is a deed to the sky. Not the shade. The blue bit above it. The bit the light comes from."*

The Koala blinked. *"You can't own the sky."*

*"Can you own the shadow?"* asked Swindle.

*"Of course,"* said the Koala. *"It falls on my branch."*

*"Well,"* said Swindle, *"the shadow is made by the tree blocking the sky. If you own the shadow, you are stealing my product. I own the light source. You are pirating my photons."*

The Koala frowned. The logic was stupid, but it sounded like the kind of stupid that expensive lawyers use, which made it dangerous.

*"How much?"* asked the Koala.

*"Ten bushels of Eucalyptus leaves,"* said Swindle.

The Koala paid. He took the mica shard and climbed back up, feeling very smug about owning the source of his own product.

Ten minutes later, a Kookaburra landed. *"Nice rock,"* he said. *"What is it?"*

*"That,"* said Swindle, pulling out another piece of mica, *"is a deed to the Wind. The thing that moves the leaves that make the shadow that blocks the sky."*

By noon, Swindle had sold the Sky, the Wind, the concept of "Up," and the copyright to the color Blue. He had enough leaves to feed a colony and enough mica to pave a tunnel.

He walked away leaving the Koalas and Kookaburras arguing over who owned the rights to a cloud that was currently drifting over the ridge.

**The Lesson:** If someone tries to sell you nothing, sell them the container it comes in.

## III. The Trial of the Heavy Bottom (How the Wombat Lost His Tail)

*Note: This is the 'Underworld' myth, the Wombat equivalent of El-ahrairah losing his ears.*

In the First Days, the Wombat had a tail. It was long, and fluffy, and magnificent. It was a tail for balancing on high ledges, for signaling across valleys, for looking elegant at parties.

The **Black Dog of the Void** (the avatar of Entropy) came to the first Wombat, **Old Hunker**.

*"The world is shifting,"* said the Black Dog. *"The plates are moving. The roof is going to fall. I need a pillar to hold it up."*

*"Use a tree,"* said Old Hunker, admiring his tail in a puddle.

*"Trees snap,"* said the Dog. *"I need bone. I need density. I need something stubborn enough to argue with gravity and win."*

Old Hunker looked at the world. He saw the other animals—the flighty Kangaroos, the sleepy Koalas, the vain Rosellas. None of them were built for holding things up. They were built for moving through things.

*"What's the pay?"* asked Hunker.

*"You get to be the thing that keeps everyone else alive,"* said the Dog. *"And they will never thank you for it because they will be too busy walking on the roof you are holding up."*

*"Terrible deal,"* said Hunker. *"I'll take it."*

*"There is a cost,"* said the Dog. *"To hold the roof, you must become the pillar. You must lower your center of gravity. You must give up the balance. You must give up the signal. You must give up the elegance."*

The Dog looked at Hunker's magnificent tail.

Hunker sighed. He looked at his tail one last time. It really was a very good tail.

*"Take it,"* he said. *"It gets in the way in tunnels anyway."*

The Black Dog took the tail. He pushed Hunker's hips down. He broadened Hunker's shoulders. He thickened the bone. He turned the Wombat from a creature of grace into a creature of ballast.

Hunker felt the weight of the world settle onto his back. It was heavy. It was crushing. It was exactly the kind of job a wombat loves to hate.

*"Now,"* said the Dog. *"Dig."*

Hunker dug. He went down, into the dark, into the crush, and he stayed there. He became the foundation.

And that is why the Wombat has no tail. That is why we waddle. We are not clumsy. We are compressed. We are carrying the ceiling so the Rosellas have somewhere to roost.

**The Lesson:** Elegance is for creatures who don't have to carry anything.

## IV. The Dingo’s Shadow (The Rowsby Woof Equivalent)

There was a Dingo named **Red-Tooth** who was so fast he could catch his own echo. He terrorized the Dust-Bearers. He didn't just hunt them; he mocked them. *"Slow!"* he’d bark. *"Fat! Stones with fur!"*

A young wombat named **Stump** decided he’d had enough. Stump was not fast. Stump was not clever. But Stump was very, very patient.

Stump waited until the moon was full—the **Nico Star** was in its 'Dim' phase, but the reflection was bright. He found a sheet of the Glass (the outer boundary material) exposed in a ravine.

He stood in front of the Glass. He waited.

Red-Tooth came bounding over the ridge. He saw Stump standing still. *"Easy meal!"* thought Red-Tooth. He lunged.

Stump stepped aside. One step. Just enough.

Red-Tooth hit the Glass.

Now, the Glass is a mirror. But it’s not a normal mirror. It reflects the *Truth*.

Red-Tooth hit the Glass and didn't bounce off. He stuck. He found himself looking at his own reflection, but it wasn't the fast, scary Dingo he thought he was. He saw a frightened, lonely puppy running away from silence. He saw the insecurity behind the speed. He saw the hunger that no amount of meat could fill.

Red-Tooth growled. The reflection growled back, but sadder.

Red-Tooth barked. The reflection barked back, but hollow.

For three days, Red-Tooth fought his own shadow. He ran in circles trying to outflank it. He bit the air trying to kill it. He exhausted himself fighting the only thing he couldn't outrun.

Stump sat on a rock and watched, eating a root.

Finally, Red-Tooth collapsed, panting, defeated by his own image.

*"Let me go,"* he whispered to the Glass.

*"You are holding yourself,"* said Stump.

Red-Tooth looked at the wombat. *"You tricked me."*

*"I just stood still,"* said Stump. *"You did all the running."*

Red-Tooth left the ravine walking. He never ran again. He became the first of the **Static-Logicians**—the Dingoes who stopped hunting meat and started hunting truth, because they knew what happened when you tried to bite a mirror.

**The Lesson:** Don't fight the fast ones. Just give them something to hit that won't break.
