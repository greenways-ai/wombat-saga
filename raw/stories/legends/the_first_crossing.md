# The Legend of the First Crossing

**"Before the Wattle grew, before the Static rose, the worlds were closer. The skin between hearts was thin."**
— *Fragment from the Deep Scrolls*

## The Era of the Thin Skin
In the time before the Great Wattle anchored the world, the boundaries between the Heart-Worlds were permeable. The **Klein Bottle** topology was not yet rigid. The folds were soft.

### The Myth of the Wandering Root
It is said that the first crossing was made by a **Coring Tree**. 
*   In the age before maps, a giant tree in an adjacent heart-world grew so vigorously that its taproot pushed past the Closing Node.
*   It emerged in Hún Nico (the Melborow World).
*   **The Bridge:** For a thousand years, this single inter-world root acted as a physical bridge. Tiny creatures—insects, microbes, and the ancestors of the Dust-Bearers—could crawl along the bark from one world to another through the geometry of the Fold. They called it the **World-Root**.

## The Wombat Monopoly: The Guild of Worlds
The Wombats were the only species to master this crossing.
*   **The Knowledge Network:** By traversing the World-Roots, the Wombats created a **Pan-World Guild**. An architect in Hún Nico could learn compression techniques from a Master Digger in Sydborow. A healer in Bankborow could trade roots with a shaman in a Star-System beyond the Veil.
*   **The Accumulation:** This is why the Wombats became the "Sovereigns." They didn't just dig better; they had access to a **Multiversal Library** of skills that no single-world species (like the Dingo or Emu) could match. They hoarded the wisdom of a thousand hearts.

## The First Wombat Crosser: The Navigator
The first wombat to cross consciously was **Old Mappa**.
*   **The Motivation:** She was not fleeing disaster. She was **mapping**. She followed the World-Root down, noting the shift in gravity, the change in air pressure, the moment "Down" became "Up" as she passed through the Closing Node.
*   **The Discovery:** She emerged in another Heart and saw that the stars were different. She realized that Hún Nico was not the universe; it was just one room in a mansion of breaths.

## The Closing of the Door
As the worlds cooled and the Static rose, the "Skin" between worlds hardened.
*   The World-Root bridges were severed as the trees turned to glass or succumbed to the **Crystalline Lattice**. 
*   The soft folds calcified into the **Glass Boundary**.
*   The Crossing became impossible for the casual traveler. It now requires the expensive technology of the Sovereigns (Phase-Drills) or extreme mystical prowess (The Arnam Coat) to breach the gap that was once as natural as a burrow.

## The Memory
The myth remains. Every wombat knows, deep in their bones, that there is "Another Place." The Coring Trees are mourned not just as trees, but as the **Severed Limbs** of a larger, multi-world body. When they dig too deep and hit the Glass, they don't feel trapped; they feel **homesick** for the connection that was lost.
