# The Arrival of the First Jacaranda

**Speaker:** The Great Jacaranda
**Tone:** Ancient, Foreign, Fractal. Speaking in "Petals"—layer over layer of meaning.
**Context:** Cooroo, sitting on the branch, asks: *"Where did you come from? You aren't from the Dream."*

"I am not from the Dream, little screamer. I am from the **Act**.

"The Wattle was born of the Breath. The Human slept, and breathed, and the Wattle grew from the vapour. It is a spirit-tree. It belongs to the air.

"I was not breathed. I was **planted**.

"Do you know what a shovel is? Not a digging-paw. A shovel. Steel blade. Wooden handle. A tool made by a Tall-One to break the earth when their own claws were too soft.

"I remember the steel.

"It was the Twilight. The Crystalisation had begun. The Tall-Ones were forgetting how to feel. They were trading their hearts for screens. But one of them—a Female, old, her bark wrinkling—remembered.

"She stood in a square of grey stone. A tiny box of soil. She held my seed. It was not a spirit-seed. It was hard. Brown. Real.

"She did not dream me. She **worked** for me. She broke the grey crust with the steel blade. She put her hands—warm, soft, hairless paws—into the dirt. She placed me there. She poured water from a vessel. She said: *'Grow here. Make it beautiful.'*

"That desire—that specific, focused, deliberate will to make a grey place beautiful—was heavier than the Dream. It was heavier than the Static.

"I fell through the Star.

"I did not float like the rain. I fell like a stone. I burned through the Frequency Void. I shattered the Law-Wind. I slammed into this red dirt with the weight of a specific promise.

"I am here because she wanted me to be here.

"The Wattle died because the Dream changed. I cannot die, little screamer. Because I am not sustained by the general weather. I am sustained by that one moment of contact. Her hands in the dirt. Her wish in the seed.

"The Static cannot tile me because I am not a repeating pattern. I am a Memory. And a Memory of Love is the only thing in the universe harder than a diamond.

"She planted me to break the grey.

"And look around you, Galah.

"The grey is breaking."
