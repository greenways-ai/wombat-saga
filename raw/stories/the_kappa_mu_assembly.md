# The Kappa Mu Assembly

**Location:** The Root Chamber — a hidden cavity beneath the Eucalyptus Groves, formed by the interlocking root systems of seven surviving stringybarks.
**Characters:** [[../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]], [[../characters#Pokero (The Dingo)|Pokero]], [[../characters#Bash (The Wallaby)|Bash]], [[../characters#Merl (The Emu)|Merl]], [[../characters#Cooroo (The Galah)|Cooroo]], [[../characters#Lolaboo (The Catalyst)|Lolaboo]].
**Time:** 23:00. The night before the wall.

---

The Root Chamber was not a room. It was an argument between seven trees about who owned the space beneath them, resolved over a century into a lattice of interwoven roots that formed walls, ceiling, and floor from a single continuous organism. The air inside tasted of tannin and damp heartwood. The floor was soft — actual soil, not the compacted Safety Grout that passed for ground in every other part of Melborow. When you pressed your paw into it, it gave. It remembered what mud was supposed to do.

Hoebat arrived first. He always arrived first. The architect surveys the room before the meeting fills it.

He ran his paw along the root-walls, checking for fractures the way a conductor checks an instrument before a performance. The roots were stressed — thinner than last season, drier at the tips — but the weave held. The seven trees above were still talking to each other through the chemistry of their interlocking systems, and as long as they talked, the chamber held.

He lit three tallow candles — animal fat rendered from the marketplace scraps, the only light source in Melborow that the **[[../lore#The Five-I's Sovereign Council (The Cathedral)|Muskbat Frequency]]** couldn't monitor because it produced no electrical signature. The flames threw shifting shadows across the root-walls, making the chamber look alive. Which it was.

Lolaboo came next. She carried a water skin — filled from the seep-bed, the real water, not the treated and taxed supply from Vitabat's pipes — and set it in the centre of the chamber without ceremony. Water in the centre. The old custom. The thing that matters most goes where everyone can reach it.

Then the others, one by one, in the order that suited their natures.

### The Arrivals

**Pokero** came from the west, through the surface scrub. He moved the way Dingoes move at night — not sneaking, which implies guilt, but *flowing*, which implies that the landscape has agreed to carry you. He dropped through the entrance hole — a gap between two root-knees wide enough for a Dingo but too narrow for a wombat, which is why Hoebat had dug a separate entrance — and landed on the soft floor with the silence of a creature whose paws were designed for exactly this.

He looked at Hoebat. Nodded once. Sat. No words. When Pokero had something to say, you knew. When he was silent, it meant he was listening to something the rest of them couldn't hear yet.

**Cooroo** arrived last among the animals but earliest in terms of awareness. He had been circling the Groves for an hour, running frequency checks from each cardinal point, mapping the sound-return of the surrounding terrain to ensure no surveillance elements had been positioned within echo-range. He entered through the ventilation gap in the root-ceiling, folding his wings against his body with the practised compression of a bird who had learned to fit into spaces designed for crawling things.

"Clear," he said. "No Root-Network signatures within two hundred metres. Zuckbat's nearest camera is at the Sector 6 junction. I jammed its echo-return with a subsonic pulse. It'll read as wind interference for the next three hours."

"You can do that?" Lolaboo asked.

"I'm a Galah. My entire species is wind interference."

**Merl** came from below.

He had been in the tunnels since dusk, navigating the sub-levels with his foot-mapping technique, avoiding the Cathedral corridors and instead using the old service shafts that predated the Five-I's infrastructure — shafts that still had curved walls, organic ventilation, the architecture of a time when wombats built for survival rather than control. He emerged from a crack in the Root Chamber's floor that shouldn't have been wide enough for an emu but was, because Merl had spent three days gradually widening it by applying precise pressure to the fault lines in the substrate.

He unfolded to his full height — his head brushing the root-ceiling — and surveyed the room with the tactical sweep of a creature who assessed every space for exits, load-bearing structures, and the number of steps required to reach open ground.

"Two exits," he said. "Surface gap and the shaft I came through. Both bottleneck at one body-width. If we need to evacuate, Cooroo goes up, I go down, the rest go west through the scrub."

"Always the cheerful one," Cooroo muttered.

**Bash** was late.

They heard him before they saw him — a rapid, irregular percussion of feet on packed earth, approaching from the south-east at a speed that suggested either urgency or a fundamental inability to move at any other pace.

A small, wiry wallaby burst through the western entrance — not the Dingo entrance or the wombat entrance or the emu shaft, but a third gap that no one had designated as an entrance and that Bash had apparently decided was one by the simple expedient of fitting through it.

"Sorry, sorry, sorry," he said, the words running together like water through a sieve. "Got held up. Comms traffic. Council's running triple encryption on the internal channels tonight — something's got them spooked, probably us, could be the wall specs, could be the audit, hard to tell when everything's encrypted with Muskbat's proprietary codec which, by the way, has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the header parsing that I've been meaning to exploit but haven't had the — anyway. I'm here. What'd I miss?"

The chamber was silent for a beat. Five pairs of eyes looked at the wallaby who was simultaneously pulling burrs from his fur, adjusting a makeshift antenna strapped to his left ear, and vibrating with the residual energy of what appeared to have been a sustained sprint across half of Melborow.

"Nothing," Hoebat said. "You're on time."

"I'm twelve minutes late."

"For you, that's early."

Bash grinned — a sharp, fast expression that appeared and vanished like a signal spike. He sat between Pokero and Merl, his legs folded beneath him in the compact crouch of a creature designed for exactly two activities: running and talking.

### The Introductions (For Lolaboo)

Lolaboo had met them individually — fragments, rumours, the occasional sighting during Hoebat's repair runs. But she had never seen them together. In the candlelight, in the living chamber, they were not what she expected.

She had expected soldiers. She got a menagerie.

A wombat with clay-stained paws. A Dingo who moved like smoke. A Galah with a crest the colour of a sunset arguing. An emu whose legs were too long for any room he'd ever been in. And a wallaby who appeared to be having a conversation with an antenna.

"Kappa Mu," she said, and the word sounded different when spoken in a room with a dirt floor and wet air and the last real trees in Melborow growing through the ceiling.

"What's left of it," Hoebat said.

### The Brief

Hoebat stood. The candle flames leaned toward him — a trick of the air currents, but it looked like the room was paying attention.

"Trumbat is building a wall."

He let the word settle. In Melborow, "wall" was not architecture. It was vocabulary. Trumbat's walls were arguments made of grout — statements about who belonged and who didn't, who was safe and who was threat, poured in Safety Grout and reinforced with the structural logic of fear.

"He's calling it the 'Great Retaining Wall of Safety.' The official purpose is 'seismic stabilisation of the Gray Grotto's northern boundary.' The actual purpose is a campaign prop for the next Sovereignty Cycle."

"The actual *actual* purpose," Bash interrupted, tapping his antenna, "is that Trumbat's polling numbers in the outer ring are down twelve points since the Sector 9 collapse. He needs a physical object that the Lo Snouts can look at and feel safe. A wall works because it's big and it's visible and it doesn't require anyone to understand structural engineering."

"The problem," Hoebat continued, "is the route. The wall runs north-south through Sectors 7 to 12."

Merl's head came up. He didn't speak. He didn't need to.

"Through the repairs," Pokero said. Not a question.

"Through every repair I've made in the last three years. Every pillar I've reinforced. Every ceiling I've shored up. The wall's foundations will cut directly through the clay-pack reinforcements. And the load distribution—"

"Asymmetric lateral pressure," Merl said. "The existing pillars are calibrated for vertical load. The wall adds a horizontal force vector. The pillars won't crack."

"They'll shear," Hoebat finished. "And the Gray Grotto collapses."

Silence. Not the Muskbat kind — the synthetic kind that filled the space where thought should be. The real kind. The kind where five creatures process the same information through five different bodies and arrive at the same conclusion by five different roads.

"The Human foundation above is still being poured," Cooroo said. His voice had the flat precision of a bird reporting aerial reconnaissance. "I've been tracking the pour schedule from the Jacaranda. They're adding a new floor every nine days. The weight above the Grotto increases by approximately—"

"Eight hundred tonnes per floor," Merl supplied.

"—eight hundred tonnes per floor. If the Great Retaining Wall shears the repaired pillars and the ceiling loses structural integrity, the Human foundation doesn't just crush the Grotto. It punches through. Sub-Level 3, Sub-Level 4—"

"The Freeze Room," Bash said. "Zuckbat's servers."

"Everything," Hoebat said. "The wall doesn't protect the Grotto. It buries it."

### The Debate

The argument that followed was not polite. Kappa Mu did not do polite. Kappa Mu did friction.

Merl spoke first, because Merl dealt in structure. "We destroy the wall before it's poured. I can map the foundation trench tonight. We find the load-bearing intersections and excavate them. The wall collapses before it sets."

"And Trumbat builds another one," Pokero said. "You're fighting the wall. You need to fight the *reason* for the wall."

"The *reason* for the wall is that Trumbat needs to look like he's doing something," Bash said. "That's a comms problem. I can jam the Frequency broadcast during the announcement, replace it with the actual structural reports that the Lo Snout foremen have been filing. If the workers hear the *real* data—"

"They won't believe it," Lolaboo cut in. "I lived in the Cathedral. I know how the Frequency works. It doesn't convince through content — it convinces through *repetition*. You can broadcast the truth once and they'll hear it. Then the Frequency resumes and the truth gets buried under forty-eight hours of 'Trust the Process.'"

"So we repeat it," Cooroo said. "I can sustain a counter-frequency for—"

"Three hours," Merl said. "Before your voice gives out."

"Four," Cooroo corrected, offended.

"The question," Pokero said, and the room quieted because when Pokero spoke it meant the silence had found something, "is not whether we fight the wall. The question is whether Hoebat stops hiding."

Every eye turned to Hoebat.

Pokero continued, his voice carrying the careful weight of a Dingo who had spent his life choosing where to place his teeth. "Three years, brother. Three years of ghost repairs. The city is standing because of you, and the city doesn't know. The Lo Snouts find your clay patches and call them miracles. Zuckbat logs your structural surpluses and calls them 'Ghost Capital.' Even Vitabat — the wombat who collects from everyone — can't bring himself to collect from what you are.

"The wall goes up because Trumbat can claim the city needs his protection. As long as *you* are a ghost, Trumbat is the only architect with a name. You want to stop the wall? Give the city a different name to trust."

The silence that followed was the loudest sound in the Root Chamber.

"He's right," Lolaboo said.

"I know he's right," Hoebat said. "That's the problem."

### The Plan

They built it the way Kappa Mu built everything — through the friction of five perspectives grinding against each other until the edges fit.

**The Repair-Ahead Strategy:** Hoebat would continue the shadow repairs, but accelerated — reinforcing every pillar in the wall's projected path before the pour date, creating a substrate so structurally sound that the wall's lateral pressure would be absorbed rather than destructive. Buying time.

**The Parallel Track:** Pokero would go to the workers directly. Not with rhetoric — that was Trumbat's tool. With presence. Sitting with them. Eating with them. Letting them see that the "Dingo threat" their Sovereign warned them about was a creature who chose, every day, not to use his teeth. The mirror. The Dingo Code.

**The Signal Watch:** Bash would monitor Council comms for the wall's pour schedule and any advance warning of the field inspection. Cooroo would maintain aerial surveillance of the Human construction above, tracking the weight accumulation. Merl would continue mapping the tunnels — not just Zuckbat's network now, but the structural skeleton of the Grotto itself, building a complete load-bearing diagram that could predict exactly where and when the collapse would begin.

"And if the repair-ahead plan doesn't hold?" Merl asked, because Merl always asked the question everyone else was thinking and no one else wanted to voice.

"Then we go loud," Hoebat said. "Then the ghost steps out of the wall."

"When?"

"When there's no other choice."

### The Oath

They stood. The Root Chamber was too small for a circle — Merl had to hunch, Cooroo perched on a root-knee, Bash vibrated in place — but they stood, and they were together, and the candle flames leaned toward the centre of the room where the water skin sat on the real soil.

Hoebat knelt. He pressed his claw into the soft floor and scratched something — a shape, a memory, a flower. A Jacaranda flower, five petals, the design that had marked their oath in the Shattered Gorge before any of them knew what the oath would cost.

"Paws," he said.

Five paws — one blunt and clay-stained, one padded and sharp-clawed, one three-toed and broad, one small and quick, one feathered wing-tip pressed flat — touched the scratched flower in the dirt.

No words. The oath had been spoken once, in the dark of the Gorge, when they were young and the words meant everything because they hadn't yet learned what "everything" cost.

Now they were older. The words meant more because they knew.

*To protect the Field when the Individual fails.*

The candle flames held steady. The roots breathed. The water sat in the centre, untouched, because it wasn't for drinking. It was for remembering what Melborow had been when water was free.

Pokero raised his head first. His eyes caught the candlelight and held it — amber, deep, the colour of the Wild Lands at dusk.

"Hoebat," he said.

"Yeah."

"When the ghost steps forward — you're not stepping alone."

Merl's foot pressed against the floor. A pulse. One beat. Confirmation.

Cooroo's crest rose. A flash of pink in the dim chamber. Signal received.

Bash's antenna twitched. Frequency locked.

Hoebat looked at Lolaboo. She was not Kappa Mu — she had not sworn the oath, had not walked the Gorge, had not held her paw against the flower in the dark. But she was the reason the oath still mattered. The catalyst. The one who had looked at a dirty grifter in the marketplace and seen an architect.

She nodded.

The Assembly was over. The plan was set. Tomorrow, the wall would begin.

And beneath the last wet trees in Melborow, five creatures who had no business being in the same room — a wombat, a dingo, a wallaby, an emu, and a galah — sat in the dirt and breathed the same air, and the air tasted of eucalyptus, and the eucalyptus tasted of time running out.
