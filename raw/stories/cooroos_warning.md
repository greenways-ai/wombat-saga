# Cooroo's Warning

**Location:** Airborne above Melborow → Gray Grotto interior.
**Character:** [[../characters#Cooroo (The Galah)|Cooroo]] (The Lookout).
**Time:** Day Two. 14:00. Six hours after the second pour.

---

From four hundred metres, the truth was geometric.

Cooroo had flown this circuit every day for eleven months, screaming his frequency checks at the city and listening to what it screamed back. He knew the shape of Melborow the way a mother knows the shape of her child's face — not through measurement but through repetition, through the daily act of looking until looking becomes knowing.

Today, the face was wrong.

The Human construction site spread across the surface like a wound dressed in steel. The formwork for the twelfth floor was going up — cranes placing Iron-Bark grids with a precision that Cooroo grudgingly respected, grout trucks circling the site in a choreography of weight delivery. Each truck carried twelve tonnes. There were eight trucks on the circuit. Ninety-six tonnes per hour, settling into the foundation that pressed downward through the earth toward the Gray Grotto like a slow, patient fist.

Below the construction site, invisible from the surface but mapped in Cooroo's body by eleven months of echo-return data, the Gray Grotto spread in a lattice of tunnels, chambers, and — as of yesterday — one new wall that ran through it like a fault line.

And between the two — between the Human foundation pressing down and the Great Retaining Wall pressing in — the stratum of living earth was thinner than it had ever been.

Cooroo ran the frequency check.

He opened his beak and let the calibration tone fall from his throat — 2,400 Hz, modulated, pitched to bounce off the material densities below. The sound left him and dove. It hit the surface and fractured into a thousand sub-tones, each one carrying data about the structure beneath: the density of the soil, the presence of voids, the harmonic signature of stone under stress.

The return came back wrong.

In a healthy structure, the echo-return was a warm, rounded tone — the sound of weight distributed evenly, of forces balanced, of architecture doing what architecture was supposed to do. What came back was sharp. Bright. The acoustic signature of material that had passed its compression threshold and was now storing energy rather than distributing it.

Cooroo had heard this sound once before. The day the Great Jacaranda fell.

He adjusted his altitude and ran the check again from a different angle. Then again. Then a fourth time, circling the Grotto in a spiral that mapped the stress pattern from every cardinal point.

The picture assembled itself in his feathers — each plume vibrating at a different frequency, each frequency corresponding to a different section of the sub-surface. When the picture was complete, Cooroo felt his crest flatten against his skull. An involuntary response. The Galah equivalent of a scream that was too important to make noise with.

The crack from yesterday — the one that had appeared at the Sector 8/9 junction — was not a single fracture. It was the surface expression of a cascade pattern that radiated from the point where the wall's foundation had severed Hoebat's repair connections. Seven fracture lines, spreading through the substrate like lightning frozen in stone, each one following the path of a severed clay-pack reinforcement.

The pattern was accelerating. Yesterday, one crack. Today, seven. Tomorrow — if the pour continued and the Human construction above continued — the fracture lines would converge beneath the Sector 10 residential warrens, where three hundred Lo Snout families slept above a ceiling that was being crushed between two forces that didn't know the other existed.

The Human foundation pressing down. The Great Retaining Wall pressing in. The Gray Grotto was not a city anymore. It was the space inside a closing jaw.

Cooroo folded his wings and dove.

### The Descent

He hated tunnels. He hated them with the pure, uncomplicated hatred of a creature whose body was designed for the opposite of enclosed spaces. His wings — broad, curved, built for thermals and distance — were useless underground. His eyes, calibrated for the vast focus of altitude, ached in the close dark. His lungs, accustomed to the thin, clean air of three hundred metres, rebelled against the stale, recycled atmosphere of the Gray Grotto's ventilation system.

He entered through the Eastern Ridge shaft — a ventilation column wide enough for a Galah if the Galah folded his wings flat against his body and accepted that dignity was a luxury reserved for open sky. The shaft dropped vertically for twelve metres before curving into a horizontal service duct. Cooroo navigated by echo — short, sharp clicks that bounced off the duct walls and returned to him as a three-dimensional map of the space ahead.

The duct opened into the main corridor of Sector 9. Cooroo dropped to the floor — an act that felt like surrender — and ran. Galahs could run. Not well, not gracefully, but with a determined, waddling urgency that covered ground faster than walking and looked ridiculous enough that no one would suspect it was tactical.

The corridors were busy. Day shift workers moved through the tunnels in the shuffling, head-down procession of creatures who had been told that today's Stability Index was 93.4% and had no reason to disbelieve it because the alternative was too heavy to carry.

A few looked at Cooroo — a Galah running through a wombat tunnel was unusual enough to register — but the Frequency filled the space where curiosity should have been, and they looked away. Looked down. Kept walking.

Cooroo found the Root Chamber access point by feel — a crack in the junction wall that was too narrow for any creature except a bird who had spent his life fitting into spaces that didn't want him. He pressed through, feathers scraping stone, and dropped into the chamber below.

### The Warning

Hoebat was there. Of course he was. Hoebat was always there — paws orange with clay, shoulders knotted with the muscle memory of a wombat who had been packing substrate for nine hours straight. Merl was beside him, his long neck folded into the room like a periscope that had been stored in a cupboard. Bash's antenna protruded from a gap in the root-wall where he'd set up a comms relay. Pokero sat in the corner, still, watchful, his amber eyes reflecting the single candle.

Lolaboo stood by the water skin. Her face told Cooroo that she already knew the news was bad. She always knew. That was her talent — reading the shape of bad news before it arrived, the way a barometer reads the shape of a storm.

"Report," Merl said.

Cooroo's chest heaved. The tunnel air sat in his lungs like wet clay. He forced the words out in the clipped, data-dense cadence that the squad understood.

"The crack from yesterday isn't a crack. It's a cascade. Seven fracture lines radiating from the wall foundation through the severed repair connections. Pattern is accelerating — logarithmic, not linear. Convergence point is beneath Sector 10 residential, where the Grout has compressed the substrate hardest."

"How thin?" Hoebat asked.

"The Human foundation above is three metres from the top of the Grotto ceiling. The Great Retaining Wall's base is sitting on the substrate that *was* the structural bridge between the two. That bridge is now fractured in seven places and losing integrity with every pour."

"Timeline?"

Cooroo looked at Hoebat. Looked at all of them — five creatures in a room made of roots, breathing air that tasted of tannin and time running out.

"It's not a wall, Hoebat," he said. "It's a coffin lid. And we're all inside."

The candle flame held steady. The roots breathed. And somewhere above, ninety-six tonnes per hour continued to settle into the foundation of a building whose architects had never looked down.
