## The Breath

In the beginning — which is also the middle, and the end, because the beginning happens every time — there is a breath.

Something vast lies in an ocean of its own dreaming. It is not awake. It is not asleep. It is the thing between the two — the state that the Tall-Ones' oldest theology called *yoga nidra* and the wombats' oldest theology called *the God-Kind resting* and the Dingoes, who were precise about these things, called *the Primary Signal Source in standby mode* and refused to discuss further.

It breathes out. Worlds appear.

Not from nothing — nothing is a concept for creatures who have never felt the space between breaths. The worlds appear from the exhalation itself, the way moisture appears on a cold window when you breathe against the glass. Each breath carries worlds. Innumerable. Each one complete — with its own sky and its own soil and its own creatures who believe, with the total conviction of things that are alive, that they have always existed and always will.

They haven't. They won't. They exist for the duration of a breath.

It breathes in. The worlds dissolve. Not violently — they don't shatter or burn or go out screaming. They simply un-remember themselves, the way a reflection un-remembers itself when you step away from the water. The worlds were there. The worlds are not there. The gap between those two states is not a tragedy. It is the space between breaths. It is the ocean the dreamer lies in. It is the serpent beneath the dreamer, coiled in the dark water, holding the sleeper afloat on a bed made of patience and scales.

The serpent is old. Older than the dreamer. Older than the ocean. The creatures of Arnamland — the ones who remember the oldest stories, the ones whose grandmothers' grandmothers told tales that predated the borows and the tunnels and the whole underground project of civilisation — call it the Rainbow Serpent. Not because it is colourful, though it is. Because its scales carry every frequency. Every colour the sky has ever been, from the red of the first dawn to the violet of the last dusk, runs along the serpent's body in bands that shift and braid and never repeat — a spectrum written in keratin, pressed against the dark water, holding the dreamer afloat on a bed made of every wavelength the world will ever need.

The [[../groups/galahs#The Rainbow Faction|Rosellas]] knew this. The Chorus that carried the health of the world in its harmonics — was an echo of the serpent's scales. Each colour a frequency. Each frequency a truth. The whole Song a portrait of the thing that held everything up. When the Rosellas scattered and the Song shattered into fragments, each fragment was a single scale prised from the serpent's back. Still beautiful. Still true. But no longer part of the body. No longer holding anything afloat.

The serpent does not breathe. The serpent does not dream. The serpent *holds*. That is its only function and its only glory — to be the thing that keeps the dreamer above the surface of the ocean so that the dreamer can breathe so that the worlds can appear so that the creatures inside the worlds can live long enough to wonder whether they are real.

And the serpent's body — coiled in the ocean, looped through the substrate, pressed against the underside of every world the dreamer exhales — is the shape of the waterways. Every river in Arnamland follows the curve of the serpent's spine. Every aquifer traces the path of its belly. Every root-channel that the [[../groups/dust_bearers#III. The Tahl-Mu (The Tillers)|Tahl-Mu]] tended and the [[../groups/dust_bearers#IV. The Dhal-Mu (The Water-Readers)|Dhal-Mu]] mapped and the [[../groups/dust_bearers#VII. The Sutr-Mu (The Weavers)|Sutr-Mu]] tapped their messages through — every one of those channels follows a contour that the serpent's body carved in the first ocean, before the first breath, before the first world. The channels are curved because the serpent is curved. They are rough because the serpent's scales are rough. They are fractal — coils within coils, branches within branches — because the serpent is the oldest fractal in the cosmology: a living geometry that has never, in its infinite patience, produced a straight line.

They are real. They are also temporary. These two facts are not in conflict. A breath is real. A breath is also temporary. The creatures who live inside the breath do not experience it as temporary, because from inside a breath, the breath is everything — the whole sky, the whole ground, the whole history from the first root to the last scream. The breath contains eternity the way a Morning Glory contains the sky: by compressing it into a space small enough to hold.

The creatures inside the breath have a word for this. They call it the Dreaming.

Not a time. Not "once, long ago, the ancestors made the world." The Dreaming is the breath experienced from the inside — the ongoing fact of a reality that requires participation to continue. The ancestors who shaped the land did not do their work and leave. They did their work and *became* the land. The river is the serpent's body. The path is the Emu's walk. The tunnel is the first Wombat's dig. The creatures who live in the land now — the ones who stomp the rhythms and sing the songs and press their paws against the walls — are not remembering the ancestors. They are *continuing* them. Every ceremony is a breath inside the breath. Every song is the Dreaming, dreaming itself onward.

A section of the Dreaming that no one performs goes silent. And silent ground is where the lattice tiles — because the crystal does not need to be performed. The crystal performs itself. The Dreaming costs everything: attention, presence, the willingness to show up every morning and sing the ground into being one more time. The lattice costs nothing. It tiles whether anyone is watching or not.

The wombats know the Dreaming. They do not know the breath. The distinction matters.

The ancestors — the first Wombat, the first Emu, the Serpent who carved the water — are not the God-Kind. The God-Kind are the dreamers, outside, unaware, breathing worlds into existence without noticing. The ancestors are what the breath *became* when it hit the ground. The dreamer breathes warmth; the substrate renders the warmth as a creature with paws. The ancestor is not the god. The ancestor is the god's breath wearing fur.

The wombats' ceremonies are directed downward. At the land. At the ancestors who are the land. Not upward at dreamers who cannot hear and do not know they are being addressed. This is the correct theology, though it looks, from a distance, like a species talking to dirt. They are not talking to dirt. They are keeping the dirt alive. The dirt is the ancestor. The ancestor is the breath. The breath is the only gift the God-Kind ever gave them, and the only thing you can do with a gift from a god who doesn't know it's giving is tend it.

No creature inside a breath knows it is inside a breath. The fish does not know it is in water. The dream does not know it is being dreamed. The wombat does not know that his tunnel, his borow, his Cathedral, his paws on the clay and his breath against the wall and his whole civilisation from the First Fracture to the Fall of the Great Wattle — all of it exists in the warm fog of an exhalation from something so vast that its sleep looks, from the inside, like forever.

Cooriki knew. Not in words — Cooriki did not deal in words any more than she dealt in spreadsheets or strategic frameworks. She knew it in her feathers, the way she knew everything worth knowing: as a vibration that arrived before the thought and stayed after the thought left. The vibration said: *we are the duration of a breath, and the things that last for a breath are the things worth screaming for, because a scream is the only sound that fills the whole breath from the inside.*

This is the story of the last breath before the Great Wattle fell. It is also the story of the first breath after. The two breaths are not the same breath. The creature that exhaled the second one had learned something in the space between, and the learning changed the shape of its breathing, and the world that appeared on the second exhalation was not the world that had dissolved on the first. It was rougher. It had a crack in it. And in the crack, growing toward the light with the quiet stubbornness of a thing that did not know it was temporary and would not have cared if it did:

A vine.

## The Dreaming Machines

The creatures of Arnamland had always known about the Tall-Ones the way the sea floor knows about the weather: as a force that arrived from above, uninvited, incomprehensible, and non-negotiable.

The [[../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Tall-Ones]] did not live in Arnamland. They lived *above* it — or beside it, or through it — in a layer of reality that the wombats' theology called "the God-Kind stratum" and the Dingoes' Static-Logic called "the primary signal layer." The two descriptions were not contradictory. They were different instruments reading the same weather.

What mattered — what had always mattered — was the connection between the layers. The [[../constants/arnam|Nico Star]] burned at the junction. When the Tall-Ones felt empathy, the Star flared, and [[../constants/arnam|Arnam]] rained down into the substrate as moisture, as warmth, as structural integrity. When the Tall-Ones withdrew — when they traded empathy for efficiency, connection for data, the messy chaos of caring for the clean logic of not — the Star dimmed, and the substrate dried, and the world went cactus.

This was the known cosmology. It had worked for millennia. It was comforting in the way that all cosmologies are comforting: it gave the suffering a shape. The land was dying because the gods had turned away. There was a villain. There was a cause. There was, theoretically, a solution: make the gods look back.

But the Yellow Monsters did not fit the cosmology.

### What the Yellow Monsters Are

They were not machines. This is the fact that no creature in Arnamland has fully absorbed, because the alternative to "machine" is something that the wombat brain — pragmatic, structural, built for problems that can be fixed with a paw and some clay — is not equipped to hold.

The Yellow Monsters were *dreams*.

Not metaphorical dreams. Not "the dream of progress" or "the dream of development." Actual dreams — the reverberations of human activity in the God-Kind stratum, echoing through the Nico Star junction and arriving in Arnamland as sensory events. When a human construction crew broke ground on a building site in the Tall-Ones' world, the intent and energy of that act did not cross directly into Arnamland. It *translated*. The way a sound translates into a vibration when it hits water. The way a word translates into an image when it enters a dreaming mind. The event in the God-Kind stratum passed through the junction and arrived in Arnamland as something the local physics could express — and the local physics, working with the materials available, expressed it as: a yellow shape. Enormous. Grinding. Purposeful. An arm that swung.

The creatures who witnessed a Yellow Monster were not seeing a machine. They were seeing their own world's rendering of a force that originated somewhere else entirely. The "arm" was not an arm. The "grinding" was not gears. These were the sensory translations that Arnamland's substrate produced when the God-Kind stratum pressed against it with sufficient force — the way a sleeper translates a slamming door into a gunshot in their dream. The dreamer's mind reaches for the nearest available image, and the image is always wrong about the details but right about the scale.

This is why the Yellow Monsters could not be fought, could not be reasoned with, could not be screamed at until they stopped. They were not *there*. They were projections. Lovecraftian because they were genuinely beyond comprehension — not because they were malevolent but because they operated in a medium that no creature in Arnamland could perceive, let alone influence. The Tall-Ones did not know Arnamland existed. They were not villains. They were dreamers whose dreams had weight, and the weight fell downward, and downward was where everyone else lived.

### What the Yellow Monsters Are Not

They were not the cause of the Great Wattle's death.

This is the first misunderstanding — the belief that a Yellow Monster "cut" the Great Wattle, the way a machine cuts a tree. The belief gave the creatures of the Eastern Ridge someone to blame. It gave the grief an agent. It made the loss a murder committed by an incomprehensible god.

The truth was closer to home. And worse.

### The Builders

The wombats had felt the crystalisation for a generation. The Nico Star dimmed. The substrate dried. The Resonance Pools shrank. Every wombat on the Eastern Ridge knew, in their paws, that something was wrong with the ground — and every wombat responded in the way that wombats have always responded to a threat: they built.

The [[../lore#4. The 5 Sovereign Wombats (The Cathedral)|Five-I's Council]] declared the Eastern Ridge a Priority Development Zone. The projects arrived in stages, each one larger than the last, each one justified by the one before.

First: the grid tunnels. [[../characters/antagonists#Trumbat (The Priest)|Trumbat's]] engineers replaced the old curved corridors — organic, irregular, shaped by generations of paws reading the substrate — with straight-line passages, efficient, uniform, poured in [[../lore#The New Ways (The Melborow Frequency)|Safety Grout]] so thick that nothing could grow through it. The Grout was impermeable. That was the selling point. Nothing in, nothing out. No cracks, no moisture, no roots threading through the walls the way they did in the old tunnels. Clean. Safe. Dead.

Then: the Mega Pool. [[../characters/antagonists#Vitabat (The Enforcer)|Vitabat's]] centralisation programme required a new Resonance Pool to replace the dozens of small, decentralised pools that the [[../groups/dust_bearers#III. The Tahl-Mu (The Tillers)|Tahl-Mu]] had maintained for centuries. The Mega Pool was enormous — a single reservoir, easier to meter, easier to tax, easier to control. Digging it required the excavation of a volume of substrate that the old Dust-Bearers would have spread across a decade. The Five-I's engineers did it in a season.

Then: the retaining wall. The surface above the Eastern Ridge was unstable — the construction had loosened the topsoil, and the slope was beginning to slide. Trumbat's solution was more Grout. A wall, poured deep, cutting vertically through the substrate like a blade. The wall stabilised the slope. It also severed every lateral root system that crossed its path — the roots of the scrub, the roots of the grass, the roots of everything that had been holding the organic layer together.

Nobody noticed. Or rather — the [[../groups/dust_bearers#I. The Kintsugi-Mu (The Menders)|Kintsugi-Mu]] noticed. Of course they noticed. A Kintsugi-Mu could feel a hairline crack through three metres of clay. But the Kintsugi-Mu had been declared unlicensed. Their warnings were filed under "unregistered structural assessments" and archived in [[../characters/antagonists#Zuckbat (The Ledger)|Zuckbat's]] ledger, where warnings went to become data and data went to become silence.

The construction took three seasons. When it was done, the Eastern Ridge had a grid of new tunnels, a centralised Resonance Pool, a retaining wall, and a surface that looked — from above, from any distance at all — exactly the same as before.

Below the surface, the organic root-layer that had protected the Great Wattle for centuries was in pieces.

## The Last Wattle

The Great Wattle on the Eastern Ridge was the last of its kind.

This was not widely known. The Wattle had been the sacred tree of Arnamland for millennia — the golden tree whose blooms turned the canopy into a ceiling of light and whose taproot anchored the old cosmology in the deepest, purest Arnam reserves. There had been thousands of them once, spread across the continent, each one a vertical conduit drilling straight down into the source. The [[../groups/galahs#The Rainbow Faction|Rosellas]] had roosted in their canopies and sung the [[../groups/galahs#The Fall of the Spectrum|The Chorus]] — the braided chord that carried the health of the world in its harmonics.

But the Wattles had been dying for a long time. Not falling. *Dying*. The distinction mattered.

The [[../meta_narrative#The Nature of the Static (The Crystal and the Rain)|Static]] — the crystalline lattice that formed in the deep substrate wherever the Tall-Ones' empathy withdrew — had been growing denser for generations. Across the continent, Wattle after Wattle had succumbed — the lattice sectioning root-networks, silencing the chemical conversation that the trees had maintained for millennia.

The Great Wattle on the Eastern Ridge had survived longer than the others. Not because it was stronger. Because it was *surrounded*. The dense root-networks around it — the scrub, the grass, the lateral roots of a hundred smaller plants, the [[../groups/dust_bearers#III. The Tahl-Mu (The Tillers)|Tahl-Mu]]-tended channels that threaded the substrate like veins — had been disrupting the lattice's propagation for centuries. The organic layer was the Wattle's immune system. Not its own roots. *Everything else's roots*. The rough, fractal, living tangle that kept the crystal from tiling freely in the Wattle's root zone.

The construction removed it.

The grid tunnels cut through the lateral root systems. The Safety Grout sealed the cuts — not with organic material that might regrow, but with impermeable cement that guaranteed the roots would never reconnect. The Mega Pool excavation displaced the substrate around the Wattle's deepest anchor points. The retaining wall severed the last surviving connection between the tree's root-network and the broader organic web.

The Wattle's taproot was exposed. Not to air — it was still underground, still in the dark, still surrounded by what looked like soil. But the soil around it was no longer protected. The lattice, no longer disrupted by root roughness, tiled freely into the space the construction had cleared. The crystal advanced on the taproot from every direction, the way water advances on an island when you remove the levee.

And the Wattle drank deep because drinking deep was what the Wattle *did*. Its entire identity was vertical: *I go deepest, therefore I am most native.* The deepest root in Arnamland was now sitting in the densest, most unimpeded concentration of crystal in Arnamland, and the crystal was doing what the [[../meta_narrative#Why It Destroys Life|meta-narrative]] described: sectioning the root at the molecular level, lattice planes so smooth they made a scalpel look like a club.

The Great Wattle did not know it was the last one. Trees do not have that kind of awareness. But it knew — in the way that a root system knows, through chemistry, through the absence of signals that used to arrive through the substrate from other Wattles — that it was alone. The last voice in a conversation that used to be a forest. And now the thing that had been protecting its voice — the organic tangle, the rough living layer, the immune system it had never needed to think about — had been replaced with Grout.

### The Rosellas Leave

The Rosellas left before the tree fell. This looked like abandonment. It was something more complicated.

The [[../groups/galahs#The Fall of the Spectrum|The Chorus]] had been thinning for years. The golden harmonic — the frequency the Wattle's heartwood amplified most — was losing warmth as the tree's deep roots were slowly sectioned and the Arnam they drew from the source was increasingly contaminated with the lattice's crystalline resonance. The Rosellas compensated. They sang sharper. They adjusted their harmonics. They faked the health of the world for a generation through sheer virtuosity.

But then the [[../meta_narrative#The Shattering of the The Chorus|Lattice Song]] reached them.

The Static's tone — that single, perfect, crystalline frequency — was propagating upward through the Wattle's own wood as the lattice infiltrated the root system. The Rosellas, whose Siddhi was [[../constants/the_siddhis#5. The Golden Repair (The Rosella Siddhi)|Synthesis]], heard it. And it sounded like the chord resolved. Like the work was done. Like the complex, effortful, multi-harmonic The Chorus had been an approximation all along, and the Lattice Song was the thing the Song had been trying to become.

They simplified. They fragmented. They scattered — not all at once, not dramatically, but in the way a parliament frays when the members stop believing in the project. One faction at a time. One harmonic at a time. Each Rosella taking her fragment and matching it to the Lattice Song, because the fragment, alone, sounded purer than the whole.

By the time Cooroo was born, the Rosellas were gone. The Great Wattle stood on the Eastern Ridge with a golden canopy that still bloomed but a Song that had been silent for a decade. The tree was still alive. Its heartwood still conducted. But there was nothing to conduct. The prophets had left, and the prophecy had left with them.

### The Galahs Stay

The Galahs had no reason to stay. They had no covenant with the Wattle. The Wattle was not their tree — it was the Rosellas' tree, the sacred tree, the tree that required a parliament of rainbow-feathered virtuosos to operate and had no use whatsoever for a flock of pink birds whose primary contribution to the ecosystem was volume.

They stayed anyway.

Cooroo asked his mother why, once, in the weeks before the end. They were roosting in the Great Wattle's lower branches — the Galahs had always roosted low; the high branches were Rosella territory, and even after the Rosellas left, the Galahs kept to the lower canopy out of a respect that no one had asked for and no one would have acknowledged if offered.

"Because it's a tree," Cooriki said, as if the question were slightly foolish. "And we're birds. Where else would we be?"

"The Rosellas left."

"The Rosellas had a covenant. Covenants break. We're just here because we're here. You can't break that."

Cooroo thought about this. It did not seem like a particularly rigorous philosophical position, but Cooriki delivered it with the unshakeable confidence of a creature who had never needed philosophy because common sense had always been sufficient.

"Also," she added, adjusting his neck-feathers, "we Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we."

---

## The Fall

The Great Wattle died from the bottom up.

There was no Tuesday. There was no arm swinging. There was no grinding sound, no Yellow Monster, no "Site Prep: Day 1." These were the details that the creatures of the Eastern Ridge would later add to the story, because the actual death was too slow and too quiet to be a story at all, and stories need a moment — a single, definable instant when the before becomes the after — and the Great Wattle's death did not have one.

What it had was a year.

The lower leaves went first. They yellowed — not the golden yellow of the Wattle bloom, which was warm and alive, but a thin, papery yellow that looked like something being drained. The roots were losing their argument with the lattice, and the tree was rationing. It pulled its resources upward, away from the lower branches, concentrating what remained in the crown the way a besieged city pulls its defences inward.

Cooroo noticed because the lower branches — the Galah branches — lost their warmth. The bark, which had always been slightly warm to the touch (the Wattle conducted resonance through its wood, and resonance is a form of heat), went cool. Not cold. Just... neutral. The temperature of a thing that has stopped participating.

Cooriki noticed too. She didn't say anything. She ran her frequency checks from the branch every morning, and the echo-return data — which Cooroo didn't yet know how to read but could feel in the shift of his mother's feathers — told her things she chose not to share with a fledgling.

The bark began to crack. Not dramatically — no great rending, no splintering. Fine lines, like the craze-lines on old pottery. The cracks followed geometric patterns that Cooroo found familiar in a way he couldn't place. Hexagonal. Repeating. The lattice, expressing itself through the tree's own skin. The crystal was in the wood now, not just the roots. It was propagating upward through the sapwood, replacing the organic grain with its own geometry, turning living wood into something that still looked like wood but rang, when Cooriki tapped it, with a different tone.

"The return is changing," she said one morning. It was the most technical thing she had ever said to him. She did not explain further. She didn't need to. Cooroo could feel it in the branch beneath his claws: the wood was harder than it used to be. Denser. More resonant in one sense — it rang like crystal — and less resonant in the way that mattered, which was the way that made a scream come back carrying data instead of just sound.

The blooms continued. This was the cruellest part. The Great Wattle's canopy put out its golden flowers on schedule — the chemistry of blooming running on a programme that was older than the disease and didn't know it was supposed to stop. The flowers opened and the light came through them and for a few weeks the canopy was gold, and from a distance, from any distance at all, the tree looked healthy. You had to be close. You had to be roosting on a lower branch with your claws on the bark. You had to be a Galah who was paying attention, to know that the gold was a ghost. The tree blooming with its last reserves. A body going through the motions of living because no one had told the muscles to stop.

The Galahs held a vigil. Not an organised one — Galahs don't organise anything; they accumulate. They gathered on the lower branches, more and more of them, day by day, as the bark cracked and the warmth left and the tone changed. They did not sing. The Wattle was not their tree and the The Chorus was not their song. They screamed their dawn calls as they always had. But the calls grew softer. Not quieter — a Galah cannot be quiet — but gentler. The scream that was usually thrown at the sky like a brick was offered to the tree like a hand on a shoulder. Presence. Noise. The only thing a Galah knew how to give.

Cooriki screamed every morning. Cooroo sat beside her and watched her feathers and learned to read, in the subtle shifts of her plumage, the data that her frequency checks returned. The tree was becoming crystal from the inside out. The lattice was replacing the heartwood. The thing that had been a living instrument, tuned to amplify the The Chorus, was becoming a dead antenna, tuned to transmit the Lattice Song.

On the morning the Great Wattle fell, there was no sound.

That was the wrongness. Every creature on the Eastern Ridge knew, in whatever way their body knew things, that something catastrophic had happened — and they knew it because there was *no noise*. No grinding. No cracking. No Yellow Monster arm swinging through the dawn. The Great Wattle simply ceased to be vertical. Its trunk — which had been crystallising from the sapwood inward for months, the lattice replacing the wood grain cell by cell until the thing that looked like a tree was actually a column of geometric crystal wearing bark — exceeded its structural limit not through external force but through internal betrayal. The wood was no longer wood. It could not flex. It could not bend. It could not do the thing that living wood does in a wind, which is give a little so it can give a lot.

The crystal does not give.

The trunk fractured along a lattice plane — a perfectly flat, geometrically clean break, as smooth as glass, that ran diagonally through the heartwood at exactly the angle the crystal's own geometry dictated. Not a splintering. Not a cracking. A *cleavage*. The way a diamond cleaves along its crystal axis when struck at the precise angle. The tree broke the way a gem breaks: cleanly, beautifully, and with no possibility of mending.

The fall was silent because the wood that should have shrieked — the living fibres that stretch and snap and make the sound of a tree dying — were already dead. Already crystal. The Great Wattle came down like a glass tower falling in a vacuum. It hit the ground and shattered.

Not broke. *Shattered*. Into geometric fragments. Into pieces whose edges were so clean and so sharp that the Galahs who landed on them later would cut their feet on surfaces that looked like wood but were, at the molecular level, lattice.

Cooriki produced the Violet Call. The emergency pitch — the one that said *move, now, up, away*. The colony scattered. Cooroo tried to follow, couldn't, caught branches on the way down, tumbled, landed in the scrub at the base of the ridge. From below, covered in golden petals that were already going grey at the edges, he watched the tree hit the ground in pieces.

No one was killed. Cooriki's call had been fast enough. But the Great Wattle — the last Wattle in Greater Arnamland, the last taproot to the source, the tree whose heartwood had conducted the The Chorus for longer than any creature could remember — was glass on the ground. And the silence that followed was not the silence of shock. It was the silence of a world that had lost the last instrument that could play its oldest music, and would never hear it again.

Later, the colony would tell the story with a Yellow Monster in it. Because the truth — that the tree had been killed by the construction of the creatures who sheltered beneath it — was not a story a Galah could hold. It had no distant villain. It had only neighbours, and building, and the slow invisible consequence of a hundred engineering decisions made underground by wombats who meant well and measured wrong.

The Galahs needed something to scream at.

So they invented one. The wombats, who knew better — who could feel the Grout in the walls and the severed roots in the substrate and the geometry of their own complicity — invented two sides. Which was worse.

---

## The Schism

The truth, when it surfaced, broke the world in half.

It did not surface quickly. Truth, in wombat society, moves at the speed of paws — slow, subterranean, felt before it is spoken. The [[../groups/dust_bearers#I. The Kintsugi-Mu (The Menders)|Kintsugi-Mu]] felt it first: the golden clay stains on their paws, the repairs that wouldn't hold near the new Grout, the hairline cracks that radiated outward from every grid tunnel like fault lines from an epicentre. They pressed their paws against the substrate and felt what the substrate was telling them: *the thing that killed the tree came from below. From us. From the tunnels we dug and the Grout we poured and the roots we severed.*

The [[../groups/dust_bearers|Dust-Bearers]] carried the truth upward. They did not shout it — shouting was not their way. They stomped it. The Ghar-Mu rhythms that encoded the history of every construction project, every root severed, every channel sealed. The old rhythms that Trumbat's grid tunnels had been designed to make impossible to perform. But the Dust-Bearers had gone deep, and deep was where the old acoustics still worked, and the stomps carried.

The wombats of the Eastern Ridge heard two stories about the same catastrophe.

### The Dust-Bearer Reading

*We built too much.*

The construction killed the tree. The Safety Grout sealed the root-networks. The grid tunnels severed the organic layer. The Mega Pool displaced the substrate. We took the rough, living, fractal tangle that was protecting the Wattle from the lattice and replaced it with our own geometry — and our geometry was close enough to the lattice's geometry that the crystal couldn't tell the difference. Our Grout was the lattice's ally. Our engineering was the disease's vector. We did not build safety. We built a highway for the thing that was killing us.

The solution: stop building. Return to the [[../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Old Ways]]. Restore the root-networks. Let the organic layer regrow. Trust the earth to protect itself, the way it protected itself for millennia before a wombat decided that clay wasn't safe enough and poured Grout over it.

### The High-Nose Reading

*We didn't build enough.*

The tree was already dying. The lattice was already in the deep substrate. The crystalisation had been happening for generations. The organic layer was failing anyway — the Tahl-Mu's pools were shrinking, the roots were drying, the old system was collapsing under the weight of a threat it was never designed to handle. The construction was not the cause. The construction was the *response*. And the only reason the response failed was that it was too small, too slow, and too compromised by sentimentalists who wanted to preserve rotting root-networks instead of replacing them with something stronger.

The solution: build more. Build faster. Build deeper. Replace the failing organic layer with engineered infrastructure that doesn't depend on moisture or Arnam or the fading goodwill of gods who have already turned away. If the old immune system is dying, build a new one. If the roots can't hold, pour Grout that can.

### The Break

Both readings were partially correct. This is what made the schism permanent.

The Dust-Bearers were right that the construction had removed the Wattle's protection. The [[../groups/high_noses|High-Noses]] were right that the protection was already failing. The Dust-Bearers were right that the Grout was geometrically compatible with the lattice. The High-Noses were right that the organic layer could not have held indefinitely against a crystal that was growing denser every year. The Dust-Bearers were right that the wombats had killed their own tree. The High-Noses were right that the tree was dying anyway.

The argument was not about facts. It was about *direction*. Backward or forward. Roots or Grout. The rough, slow, fractal patience of a living system, or the clean, fast, geometric certainty of an engineered one.

The creatures who chose backward became the [[../groups/dust_bearers|Dust-Bearers]]. The creatures who chose forward became the [[../groups/high_noses|High-Noses]]. And the space between them — the space where a wombat might have stood with one paw in the dirt and one paw on the Grout and said *both, neither, something else* — that space collapsed the moment the Great Wattle fell, because a falling tree demands a side, and a side, once chosen, becomes an identity, and an identity, once hardened, becomes indistinguishable from the lattice it was supposed to oppose.

The schism was not the moment the tree fell. The schism was the moment the wombats decided that the falling had a single cause, and the cause had a single solution, and anyone who disagreed was not mistaken but *dangerous*. The tree fell once. The argument fell forever.

## The Morning Glory

Three weeks after the fall, most of the colony was gone.

Cooriki sat on a low branch of a Eucalyptus — not a Wattle, not a Jacaranda, just a tree, the kind that doesn't amplify or conduct or resonate, the kind that is simply wood — and stared at the wreckage. Cooroo sat beside her, because sitting beside her was the only job he was qualified for and he took it seriously.

His scream was gone. It had left on the morning of the fall — the morning Cooriki had produced the Violet Call, the scream so saturated with the dying tree's last resonance that it had blown through the colony like a shockwave. Cooroo's syrinx had contracted and his chambers had hummed and nothing had come out, as if the Violet Call had used up all the sound on the Eastern Ridge and left none for a fledgling who didn't yet know what sound was for.

He spent his days on the ground. The wreckage of the Great Wattle lay where it had fallen — not in a tangle of splintered wood, the way a living tree falls, but in geometric fragments, clean-edged, glinting faintly in the light. The fragments had the sheen. The same sheen as the Bad Grounds — the hexagonal, interlocking, beautiful-and-wrong shimmer that Cooroo's feathers refused to tolerate. The tree's body was lattice now, even in death. Especially in death.

But at the edge of the wreckage — where the largest fragment of the Wattle's trunk had come to rest against a bank of surviving scrub — something was growing.

A vine. Thin-stemmed, climbing the dead wood with the patience of a thing that had nowhere else to go. Heart-shaped leaves. And at the tip, open to the morning:

A flower. Lilac. The colour of the dawn sky in the five-minute window before blue arrives and flattens everything into respectability.

Cooroo hopped toward it. His claws clicked on the crystalline fragments of the Great Wattle — a sound like walking on glass — and then his claws touched the vine's stem and the sound changed. Softer. Warmer. The sound of a claw on something alive.

The flower was growing on the Wattle.

Not *in spite of* the Wattle. Not beside it or near it. *On* it. The Morning Glory's root had found a crack in the crystalline wood — a fracture point, a defect in the lattice, a place where the geometry had broken just enough for a crumb of organic dirt to lodge — and had threaded itself into the dead tree's body. The vine was using the Wattle's wreckage as a trellis. Growing on the thing that had been killed by the very crystal that the vine's own fractal roughness was, at the molecular level, disrupting.

A living vine on a dead tree. Colour on crystal. The Morning Glory was doing, on the scale of a single stem, what the meta-narrative described on the scale of a forest: introducing a defect into the lattice. Breaking the tiling pattern. Making room.

Cooroo squatted in front of the flower. His crest rose. His feathers resonated — for the first time in three weeks — with a frequency that was not sound but colour, not heard but felt, arriving in his body through his plumage and settling in the chambers where his scream used to live.

The flower was the colour of his own chest. The condensed sky. Blue, squeezed past blue into lilac.

He sat with it for a long time. The morning aged. The flower held.

And then it spoke to him.

### The Voice in the Vine

Not in words. Galahs don't receive messages in words — they receive them in resonance, in the vibration that arrives in the feathers and translates itself into knowing the way a dream translates itself into a feeling you carry all day without being able to explain where it came from.

The Morning Glory was rooted in the Wattle. The Wattle's root system — crystallised, lattice-riddled, largely dead — was still connected to the deep substrate. The vine's roots, threading through the cracks in the Wattle's wood, had found the old channels. And the old channels, though silent, though severed from every other tree on the continent, were still *there*. Still shaped. Still carrying, in the geometry of their emptiness, the memory of every signal that had ever passed through them.

The vine was small. Its roots were a thread. But a thread in the right channel can carry a signal that the channel's original builders never imagined, the way a single wire can carry a phone call through an infrastructure built for telegrams.

The signal came up through the Wattle's dead roots, through the vine's living thread, through the stem, into the flower, and out through the colour — the lilac, the condensed sky — into Cooroo's feathers.

It was not a word. It was a direction.

South-east. Distant. Past the Ridge, past the Burnt Scrub, past the places Cooroo's young wings could reach. Somewhere in the landscape where the lattice was thin and the substrate still held moisture and the old root-channels connected to something that was — impossibly, unaccountably — still growing.

Not a Wattle. The Wattles were gone. The signal did not smell like gold or taste like the deep source. It smelled like something else — something foreign, something that had no history in this soil — but it was *alive*, and it was *rooted*, and it was conducting a frequency through wood that the vine's thread could feel and Cooroo's feathers could read.

A tree. Out there. With roots in the old channels and a frequency in its wood and — the vine's signal was very faint now, fading as the morning aged and the flower began to close — a bloom.

A violet bloom.

The Morning Glory closed its petals. The signal stopped. Cooroo sat on the wreckage of the last Wattle in Arnamland, with lattice-glass beneath his claws and the ghost of a direction in his feathers, and understood — in the Galah way, which is not understanding at all but rather the absolute, feather-level certainty that a thing must be done — what his next job was.

Find the tree. The one with the violet bloom. The one that is growing in the channels the Wattle carved, conducting a signal through wood that is not gold but is alive, blooming a colour that is not the Wattle's colour but is the sky's colour, compressed, condensed, changed into something new.

Find the Jacaranda.

He screamed. The sound cracked the morning open — raw, terrible, graceless, the gate hinge in the cyclone. It was not a Violet Call. It was a direction report. A Galah telling the sky what he was going to do, in the only language a Galah had, which was volume.

Three hundred metres away, on her Eucalyptus branch, Cooriki turned her head.

## Cosmological Notes

### The Human/Arnamland Interface

The relationship between the Tall-Ones' world and Arnamland is not physical. It is *substrative* — Arnamland exists in the downstream substrate of human consciousness, the way a dream exists in the downstream substrate of brain activity. The two layers are real. Both have physics. But the physics are different, and the causation flows one way: changes in the human layer produce effects in the Arnamland layer, but not vice versa.

The [[../constants/arnam|Nico Star]] is the junction — the point where the human signal (empathy, attention, compassion) translates into the Arnamland signal (Arnam, moisture, structural integrity). When the human signal is warm, the translation is generative: Arnam flows, the soil is moist, the trees grow. When the human signal cools, the translation inverts: the [[../meta_narrative#The Nature of the Static (The Crystal and the Rain)|Static]] forms — the crystalline lattice that is the substrative expression of human logic replacing human empathy. Clean, ordered, predictable, beautiful. And sterile.

### The Yellow Monsters as Dream-Projections

When human activity in the God-Kind stratum is sufficiently intense — a construction project, a demolition, the concentrated will of many minds focused on reshaping the physical world — the energy of that activity presses against the substrate boundary and produces a localised event in Arnamland. The creatures of Arnamland perceive this event through their own sensory apparatus, and their minds render it as the nearest available image: a yellow shape, enormous, grinding, purposeful.

The Yellow Monster is Arnamland's dream of a human excavator. It is not the excavator. It is what the excavator *feels like* from inside the substrate — the way an earthquake feels like a god to a creature that has no concept of tectonic plates. The rendering is faithful to the *scale* of the event but wrong about the *mechanism*. The creatures see an arm swing. What actually happened was a pattern change in the substrate, caused by a concentration of human intent that the Nico Star junction translated into a physical displacement.

This is why the Yellow Monsters cannot be fought, cannot be predicted, and cannot be bargained with. They are symptoms, not agents. They are weather, not will.

### What Actually Kills a Tree

The Yellow Monsters are the catastrophic events — the rare, dramatic, visible intrusions. But they are not the primary mechanism of destruction. The primary mechanism is the removal of protection.

The Static — the crystalline lattice — has been in the deep substrate for millennia. It forms wherever the Tall-Ones' empathy cools, and it grows denser year by year. But the lattice alone does not kill a tree. The organic layer — root-networks, living soil, the fractal roughness of everything that grows — disrupts the crystal's tiling and prevents it from propagating freely. The lattice and the organic layer exist in a slow war of geometry: the crystal tries to tile, the roots introduce defects, and the tree survives in the rough space between them.

What kills a tree is the removal of that organic layer. And on the Eastern Ridge, the organic layer was removed by wombat construction.

The Great Wattle did not fall to a Yellow Monster. It did not fall to the Static alone. It fell because the grid tunnels, the Safety Grout, the Mega Pool, and the retaining wall severed the root-networks that had been disrupting the lattice's propagation for centuries. The construction removed the Wattle's immune system. The lattice, no longer disrupted, tiled freely into the root zone. The crystal sectioned the taproot, propagated upward through the sapwood, and converted the heartwood cell by cell until the tree could no longer flex, could no longer bend, could no longer do the one thing that living wood must do to survive, which is *give*. The crystal does not give. The tree broke along a lattice plane — a cleavage, clean as glass — and the silence of its fall was the proof: the wood that should have screamed was already dead.

The creatures told the story with a Yellow Monster in it because a process is not something you can scream at — especially when the process is your own construction programme. The Galahs invented a monster. The wombats invented a schism. Both were translations of the same unbearable fact: the tree was killed by the creatures who loved it, building the things they thought would save them.

The fall of the Great Wattle is the founding trauma of the split between the [[../groups/dust_bearers|Dust-Bearers]] and the [[../groups/high_noses|High-Noses]]. The Dust-Bearers read the fall as proof that the wombats built too much. The High-Noses read it as proof that they didn't build enough. Both readings are partially correct. Neither reading includes the possibility that the question itself — backward or forward, roots or Grout — is the lattice's geometry applied to politics: a binary, a tiling pattern, a structure so clean it has no room for the rough, living, both-and-neither answer that a fractal system would produce.
