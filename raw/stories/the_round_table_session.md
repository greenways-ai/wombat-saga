# The Round Table Session: The Architecture of Silence

**Location:** The High-Bureau, Sub-Level 1. The "Olympic Chamber."
**Time:** 03:00 (The Witching Hour of the Frequency).
**Characters:** Trumbat, Muskbat, Tatebat, Vitabat, Zuckbat.

The table was not round. It was a pentagon made of polished **Nullcrete**, so black it drank the light.

Trumbat sat at the head (Earth). His radiant white fur glowed against the dark stone, and his deep purple eyes were half-closed, scanning a reality only he could see. He did not sit; he *presided*.

To his left, Vitabat (Water) drummed the fingers of his organic hand on the table. His left arm—the metal one—was still, a heavy chrome paperweight resting on a frozen datapad. His white suit was impeccable, but the air around him dropped ten degrees.

To Trumbat's right, Tatebat (Metal) was vibrating. He wasn't shaking; he was *oscillating* at a frequency of pure genius. His purple fur was manicured into geometric patterns, and he wore his shutter shades indoors. He was sketching on the table surface with a light-stylus, muttering about "negative space" and "the aesthetic of compliance."

Further left, Muskbat (Fire) hovered—literally. His jetpack hummed with a magnetic levitation field, keeping him three inches off the chair. He twitched, his AR goggles flashing with red error messages he refused to acknowledge.

And on the far right, blending into the shadows of the corner, sat Zuckbat (Wood). His dark green hoodie was pulled low. Blue and red math equations spiraled out of his pockets like smoke, drifting across the table to tally the silence.

## I. The Agenda (The Glitch)

"The yield is down," Zuckbat whispered. He didn't look up from his hands. "The Arnam Reservoirs are at 40% capacity. The Dingoes are delivering the Static, but the conversion rate is falling. The Nullcrete is becoming... porous."

"Porous?" Trumbat’s voice was warm honey. "Nonsense. The Golden Gospel is solid. The Great Retaining Wall is eternal."

"It's not the gospel, it's the chemistry," Muskbat snapped, tapping his goggles. "The Static is getting too toxic! The Humans are angry upstairs. Their data is jagged. When we compress it into blocks, it creates micro-fractures. We need a cleaner signal!"

"Don't blame the material," Tatebat interrupted, slashing a line of light across the table. "Blame the *vibe*. The Lo-Snouts are depressed. Grey tunics? Boring. Depression weakens the psychic mortar. I told you, we need to redesign the uniforms. Give them something to *feel*. If they feel like Kings, they dig like machines."

Vitabat’s metal arm whirred. "If they stop digging," he said, his voice like cracking ice, "I will break their legs. That usually fixes the 'vibe'."

## II. The Vision (The Architect vs. The Enforcer)

"So primitive," Tatebat scoffed, adjusting his oversized robes. "You break a leg, you lose a worker. You lose a worker, Zuckbat logs a deficit. It’s bad design, V. It’s ugly. I’m talking about *elevation*. We don't force them to build the Great Retaining Wall. We make it *aspirational*."

He stood up, throwing his arms wide. "Imagine! We tell them the Great Retaining Wall isn't a barrier. It's a canvas! 'The Great Canvas of Melborow.' We sell them squares. They pay *us* to paint their names on the prison bars! It’s genius! It’s the Ye-Flow!"

"It is a security risk," Vitabat grunted.

"It is a revenue stream," Zuckbat corrected, the equations around him turning from red to blue. "If we monetize the surface area of the containment structure... the debt cycle stabilizes for three quarters."

Trumbat raised a silky paw. The room went silent.

"Peace, my children," he purred. "Tatebat is right. The cage must be beautiful. But Vitabat is also right. The cage must be strong."

He leaned forward, his golden mitre catching the single spotlight.

"Muskbat," Trumbat said softly. "Fix the Frequency. Make it smoother. If the Static is toxic, filter it. I want the signal to feel like *this*." He touched his own white fur. "Silky. If the Dingoes go mad, let them. We only need the product."

"I can't just 'filter' rage!" Muskbat shrieked, spinning in mid-air. "The algorithm is based on engagement! If I remove the anger, the signal drops! The Dingoes harvest the hate because the hate is *heavy*! You want heavy blocks? You need heavy hate!"

## III. The Verdict (The Ring)

Trumbat smiled. It was a terrifying expression—benevolent and completely hollow.

"Then we shall sanctify the hate," Trumbat whispered. "We will not call it 'Static' anymore. We shall call it 'The Test'. We will tell the Lo-Snouts that the headache they feel... is the weight of their own holiness."

He looked at the five of them. Earth, Water, Metal, Fire, Wood. A perfect, closed loop.

"Tatebat, design the campaign. 'The Holy Headache'."
"Vitabat, collect the tithe for the cure."
"Muskbat, amplify the signal."
"Zuckbat, record the names of those who don't complain."

Trumbat closed his purple eyes.

"The meeting is adjourned. Go forth and protect them from the truth."

Zuckbat watched them leave. He stayed in his chair, watching the math equations turn blood red as they drifted toward the ceiling. He wrote a single number in his ledger: *Zero.*
