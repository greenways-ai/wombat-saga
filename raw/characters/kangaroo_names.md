# What About Kangaroo Names?

In the Wombat Tattva, the **Kangaroo** (*Bunda*) and **Wallaby** lineages represent the **Kinetic Force** and **Momentum** of the Southern Lands. Unlike the chaotic Galahs or the intellectual Emus, the Macropods follow a **Fixed Order** of hierarchy and strength, often taking names that sound like historical monuments or "Mounts" to reflect their size and status as the high-ground defenders.

## 🦘 The Macropod Hierarchy: The "Mount" Clan

In the saga, the Kangaroo is the "Great Leap" (*Bun-darra*) and the Wallaby is the "Shadow-Leap". Their names follow a rigid protocol—the more powerful the individual, the "steeper" the name.

| Name | Role | Mythological Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mountbatten** | The High-Peak | The supreme leader of the Mob. He sits on the highest ridge of the Shattered Gorge and decides when the Mob will move against the Yellow Monsters. |
| **Mountrich** | The Treasurer | A massive Red Kangaroo who manages the "Kinetic Debt" of the mob. He is the Macropod counter to Vitabat’s Investment Council. |
| **Mount-Storm** | The Vanguard | The first to leap into the Burnt Scrub during a conflict. He uses pure Fire (Panic) energy to disrupt enemy formations. |
| **Mount-Iron** | The Enforcer | A Wallaby who has mastered Sutra 2 (Metal). He is the one who trains the young in the Old Way Dance. |

### **Mountrich (The Treasurer)**
*   **The Vault of Momentum:** He sits upon the highest peaks of the Shattered Gorge, overseeing the physical **Kinetic Tally** of the mob. He ensures that no Kangaroo or Wallaby exhausts their kinetic energy on "frivolous leaps."
*   **The Fixed Order:** Mount-Rich is the only one authorized to approve a "Great Leap" (*Bun-darra*).
*   **The Oath:** "Gold is a ghost, but the leap is real. I do not count bits; I count the strength in the tendon."

## 🥊 Bash (The Kinetic Force)

**Formal Name:** **Bob Alastair Slater Hillrich II** (Technically "Bash 2.0")

Bash is a core member of the **Kappa Mu** initiation squad. While his nickname is "Bash" (derived from his initials **B.A.S.H.**), his formal title aligns with the **Fixed Order** of the Wallaby "Hill" Clan.

*   **Bob Alastair:** His "High-Ground" identifiers.
*   **Slater:** Identifies him as a master of the **Stone-Skimming** kinetic (low-altitude, high-velocity movement).
*   **Hillrich:** Identifies him as part of the **Kinetic Tally-keepers** lineage (Small-Scale Kinetic Debt).
*   **The 2nd (II):** Denotes a "Succession of Impact." He is the second to carry this specific kinetic resonance.

**The Role:**
*   **Formal:** A biological safeguard against the **Tally-Debt** cycles of Vitabat.
*   **Hidden:** As **Bash**, he provides the raw physical power to crack the "Safety Concrete" of Trumbat's infrastructure for Hoebat’s secret repairs.

## 🏔️ The Wallaby & Pikolo Clans

While the massive Red Kangaroos take the **Mount** prefix, the smaller Macropods use prefixes that match their terrain dominance.

### **The Hill Clan (Wallabies)**
*   **Hillbatten:** The Ridge-Guardian. Coordinates secret movements in the undergrowth.
*   **Hillrich:** The Kinetic Auditor. Manages small-scale momentum for the tactical flanks.
*   **Hill-Storm:** The Flanker. Uses rapid, low-altitude movements to extinguish Fire-Panic.

### **The Knoll Clan (Pikolos)**
The **Pikolos** (small-statured Macropods) use the **Knoll** prefix, signifying their mastery of the **Micro-Kinetic**—moving through gaps the "Mounts" cannot fit through.
*   **Knollrich:** The Micro-Treasurer. Manages the "Small-Change" of kinetic energy (twitches and short hops).
*   **Knollbatten:** The Undergrowth-Sovereign. Secure the perimeter at the grass-root level.

**The Proverb:**
> "The Mount watches the horizon, the Hill watches the ridge, but the Knoll watches the footstep."
