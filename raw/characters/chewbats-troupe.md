# Chewbat's Troupe — Skills and Domains

*The troupe's design is structural: no single member covers everything. Each rescue, each trial, requires assembling the right combination. What one cannot do, another must.*

---

## Chewbat — The Singer
**Domain:** Resonant / Passive
**Species:** Wombat

Chewbat does not fight. His skill is the crossing itself — the capacity to hold Image (Rūpa) and Song (Nāda) as a single thing, and to use both together to open the node between worlds. No other member of the troupe can do this. No enemy in any Heart-World has encountered it before. His purity means that systems designed to categorize, scour, or simplify find no purchase on him.

**Abilities:**
- Holds the Image — the true visual form of a node beneath its surface distortion
- Holds the Song — the resonant frequency of a crossing-point
- Sings a node open when both are present simultaneously
- Cannot be scoured, filed, categorized, or emotionally cauterized — his inner song does not simplify

**Limitations:**
- Entirely dependent on the troupe for protection
- Cannot fight, navigate, or transform
- Can only cross a node he has found the Image and Song for — discovery requires exposure, which requires risk

## Tekanter — The Physical
**Domain:** Body / Sense / Force
**Species:** Kangaroo

Tekanter is the troupe's physical instrument. His senses operate at a range and precision that exceed any other member — he hears what is not meant to be heard, sees at distances that should be impossible, reads the quality of a place through its ground vibration. In combat he is devastating: fast, economical, and structured around the kangaroo's natural kinetics — the full-body weight of the leap, the raking power of the hind kick, the defensive use of his tail as a pivot. A single bound carries him distances that would take others minutes to walk.

He is not elemental. He carries no fire, commands no weather, performs no transformation. His power is entirely physical — but physical operating at a register that borders on the uncanny.

**Abilities:**
- Hearing: detects sub-frequencies in crystal, stone, and wind; can identify a lure from a genuine anomaly; hears structural weakness before it appears
- Sight: long-range precision in difficult light; can read body language and intent at distance
- Movement: covers extraordinary distances in a single bound; difficult to track or anticipate
- Combat: ferocious and technically precise; fights with the full kinetic force of his body; opponents who expect a slow fighter are not prepared for what arrives

**Limitations:**
- Has no elemental capacity — cannot manipulate fire, water, air, or earth
- Cannot transform, go invisible, or change his metabolic signature
- Cannot open nodes or read resonance
- His physical power makes subtlety difficult — he is hard to disguise and hard to hide

## Jeosmi — The Elemental
**Domain:** Elements / Concealment
**Species:** Koala

Jeosmi commands the four classical elements as active forces — not as symbols but as substances he can shape, redirect, and project. Fire is his primary element in combat; he can also work with wind as a displacement force, water as a conductive medium, and stone as a blunt instrument. He does not have Goapus's alchemical precision in transformation, but he can shift his elemental signature sufficiently to become invisible — not a trick of light but a withdrawal from elemental presence, so that any faculty that reads the world through heat, vibration, or resonance finds nothing where he stands.

**Abilities:**
- Fire: generates and directs combustion as a combat force; can expand heat as a structural disruption, collapse cold environments, shatter crystal
- Wind: displaces air at force; can redirect projectiles, create pressure differentials, ventilate or seal spaces
- Water: directs existing water as a conductive or percussive force; cannot create water from nothing
- Stone: applies force through existing rock; limited shaping
- Invisibility: withdraws his elemental signature entirely; becomes undetectable to any sense that reads the world through heat, vibration, or resonance; does not affect sight in full light, but is complete in the dark or against the noise of an active environment

**Limitations:**
- No physical combat capacity at Tekanter's level — he relies on elemental force, not body
- Cannot open nodes or read resonance
- Cannot perform the alchemical transformations Goapus uses
- Invisibility is disrupted by direct contact

## Goapus — The Alchemical
**Domain:** Transformation / Substance
**Species:** Platypus

Goapus transforms. Not the elemental shifts of Jeosmi, who works with forces — Goapus changes substance, taking on the qualities of the material world around him. He can become rock: dense, immovable, indistinguishable from the stone he stands beside. He can become plant: rooted, porous, breathing at the rate of growing things, invisible to any sense that reads for animal life. He can become animal: any species he has studied closely enough, full mimicry of form and biological signature. In each transformation he retains his own mind and intent.

He is also a capable fighter. His platypus body carries a venomous spur on the hind leg that he can deploy with or without transformation, and he fights with a compact, low-centre-of-gravity efficiency that makes him difficult to strike cleanly. He is not Tekanter's equal in open combat, but in close quarters or from ambush he is considerably more dangerous than he appears.

His original capacity — reading the water-memory of ancient riverbeds and underground channels — remains. He navigates by what the land used to be as much as what it is.

**Abilities:**
- Rock transformation: full density and chemical composition of stone; holds indefinitely; undetectable by touch, sight, or vibration-sense
- Plant transformation: takes on the biological signature of a specific plant; breathes as vegetation; invisible to senses that screen for animal life
- Animal transformation: full mimicry of form and biological signature of any species studied; voice, scent, heat signature, movement pattern
- Venom: platypus spur, deployable in any form; causes significant localized pain and disrupts motor function
- Water-memory navigation: reads the history of waterways through sub-surface channel structure; locates things that move along old routes
- Combat: efficient, precise, ambush-capable; fights well in all transformations

**Limitations:**
- Cannot generate elemental force — cannot throw fire, redirect wind, or manipulate water beyond reading its memory
- Animal transformation requires prior study; cannot improvise a species he has never examined closely
- Cannot open nodes or hold resonance
- Rock and plant transformations sacrifice mobility

## Notes on Troupe Structure

The troupe's gaps are as important as their skills.

Chewbat cannot protect himself — every trial begins with his vulnerability and ends with his survival requiring all three others. Tekanter is formidable but opaque to systems that read the world elementally or alchemically; environments built around filing, resonance, or transformation have no existing category for pure physical force, which is sometimes an advantage and sometimes a wall. Jeosmi's invisibility is the troupe's best infiltration tool but dissolves on contact. Goapus can become anything he has studied, which means every new world is a world of things he has not yet studied.

No single member can complete a trial. The design is structural.
