# The Violet Sentinel

**Location:** The Highest Jacaranda, Eastern Ridge of Melborow.
**Character:** [[../../characters#Cooroo (The Galah)|Cooroo]] (The Lookout).
**Time:** Pre-dawn. The hour when the sky remembers it was once violet.

---

The branch was thinner than it looked. It always was. Cooroo adjusted his grip — two claws forward, one back, the way his mother had taught him before the singing stopped — and let the wind do the work of balance.

From this height, Melborow was almost beautiful.

The Gray Grotto spread below like a bruise under skin, its tunnels invisible from the surface but their presence betrayed by the slight sag of the earth — depressions in the grass where the ceilings were failing. To the west, the Cathedral rose as a ridge of compacted clay and stolen river-stone, its ventilation shafts breathing out the warm, perfumed air of the High-Noses' chambers. And beyond it all, the horizon where the **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monsters]]** slept in rows, their arms folded down, waiting for the sun to wake them.

Cooroo stretched his crest — a sweep of rose-pink that the other Galahs called "too much" and the wombats called "ridiculous." He didn't mind. Ridiculous was the point. A Galah who wasn't ridiculous was just a pigeon with better marketing.

He opened his beak and let the first note of the morning fall from his throat.

It was not a song. Not yet. It was a frequency check — a single tone that bounced off the Cathedral walls and returned to him carrying data. The echo told him what the eye could not: that the south-western pillar had shifted two millimetres in the night, that the moisture content of the Gray Grotto air was down another fraction, that somewhere deep below, a wombat had been digging. Not the mechanical scraping of a Lo Snout on shift — the quiet, careful, *old* kind of digging. Hoebat's kind.

Cooroo filed the information in his body the way all Galahs did — not in the mind, but in the feathers. Each detail vibrated a different plume. His mother had called it the **Violet Resonance**: the ability to read a city by listening to what it said back to you when you screamed at it.

His mother.

### The Great Jacaranda

The memory arrived the way it always did — not invited, but not fought. Cooroo had learned long ago that fighting memories was like fighting the wind. You just ended up tired and in the same place.

He had been a fledgling. Three weeks out of the egg, all beak and appetite. The colony roosted in the **Great Jacaranda** — the oldest tree in the Eastern Ridge, its trunk wide enough that four wombats could ring it paw-to-paw and still not touch. It bloomed twice a year in explosions of violet that turned the sky purple and made the wombats below stop and look up, which was the only time wombats ever looked up.

His mother, **Cooriki**, was the colony's Lead Caller. Not the loudest — there was always some young male who could out-screech her — but the most *precise*. She could pitch a call that would bounce off the Cathedral's northern face, ricochet off the Marketplace awnings, and arrive at the Gray Grotto entrance at exactly the frequency that made Lo Snout workers look toward the sky. Not to see a bird. To remember that there *was* a sky.

"We are the Noble Noise," she told him, adjusting his neck-feathers with her beak. "The wombats dig. The dingoes run. We scream. All three are prayer."

He had not understood then.

The **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monsters]]** came on a Tuesday. Cooroo learned later that it was a Tuesday because the Tunnel-Purity League had noted the date in their incident report — filed six months after the fact, with a footnote about the "regrettable aesthetic impact on the Eastern canopy."

The sound came first. Not a roar — something deeper. A grinding that Cooroo felt in his sternum before his ears caught it. The Great Jacaranda shuddered from root to crown. Violet petals fell like burning snow.

Cooriki launched from the branch, wings wide, voice already rising to the emergency pitch — the one that said *move, now, up, away*. The colony scattered in a cloud of pink and grey. Cooroo tried to follow, but his wings were too new. He flapped and fell, flapped and fell, catching branches on the way down like a stone skipping backwards up a waterfall.

From below, tangled in a fork of bark, he watched.

The Yellow Monster's arm swung. Not fast — these things were never fast; they were patient in the way that only the truly enormous can be — and the Great Jacaranda cracked at the base. Not broke. *Cracked*. The sound was like a bone snapping inside a body. Internal. Wrong.

The tree fell in stages, the way a giant falls — first the disbelief, then the lean, then the long, slow surrender to a gravity that had always been waiting.

When the dust settled, half the colony was scattered across the Eastern Ridge. No one was crushed — Cooriki's warning had been fast enough. But the Jacaranda was gone. Two hundred years of root and reach and bloom, reduced to a tangle of splintered wood that the Yellow Monster's operator would later describe as "Site Prep: Day 1."

Cooriki never sang the same after that.

She could still call. Could still pitch frequencies and bounce echoes. But the undertone — the vibration that made her Noble Noise more than noise — was gone. It was as if the tree's death had snapped something in her throat that no veterinarian could find because it wasn't physical. It was the thread that connected voice to purpose.

She became quiet. A quiet Galah. The colony whispered about it the way families whisper about a wound they can't treat. Eventually, Cooriki stopped flying altogether. She sat on a low branch of a lesser Jacaranda and stared at the stump of the Great One as if waiting for it to grow back.

Cooroo visited her every morning. He would scream his frequency checks from the highest point he could find, and then descend to her branch and sit in the silence with her.

"Why do you still scream?" she asked him once. "They cut the tree. The Noble Noise has no return. It just... goes."

"Maybe that's the point," he said, not understanding his own answer.

### The Obsidian Prism

Cooroo did not know what the **[[../../lore#The Maha Tahto (The Great Truth)|Obsidian Prism]]** was when Hoebat first described it. But when Hoebat said — "It shows you what is left *out*" — Cooroo felt his feathers shift.

Because that was what his flight was. The Prism, airborne.

When Cooroo flew over Melborow, he did not look at what was there. He looked at what was *missing*. The gap where the Great Jacaranda once stood. The shadow-line where a root system used to hold the eastern bank. The hollow echo where a pillar should have returned his frequency check but didn't — because someone, some ghost in the night, had already repaired it, and the new clay returned a warmer tone.

Hoebat's repairs were invisible to the eye. But to a Galah who screamed at the city every morning, they sang back in a different key.

That was how Cooroo found the Resistance before the Resistance found him.

### Noble Noise

The wombats called it "noise." The dingoes called it "interference." The emus called it "that bloody bird."

Cooroo called it the only thing a Galah could do in a world that had decided trees were disposable.

When **[[../../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]]** asked him to join Kappa Mu — to be the "Lookout," the "Satellite View" — Cooroo almost laughed. "You want me to be a pair of eyes? I'm a *voice*, Hoebat. I was born to be heard."

"Then be heard," Hoebat said, in that way he had of making simple words sound like structural blueprints. "But be heard with *purpose*. A scream that carries data is not noise. It's architecture."

Cooroo thought about his mother. About the Noble Noise that had saved a colony but could not save a tree. About the Violet Resonance that turned screaming into listening.

"I'll be your sentinel," he said. "But I won't be quiet about it."

Now, on the highest Jacaranda — a lesser tree, a survivor, its trunk narrow and its blooms sparse but its roots stubborn — Cooroo stretched his crest and let the second note fall.

Below, the Gray Grotto shifted in its sleep. The dawn was coming. The Yellow Monsters would wake soon.

Cooroo screamed the morning open and listened to what the city screamed back.

The south-western pillar held. Hoebat's work held.

But the earth above the Grotto was heavier than yesterday. The Human foundation was growing. And the frequency check returned something new — a low, grinding harmonic that Cooroo had heard only once before.

The sound the Great Jacaranda made before it fell.
