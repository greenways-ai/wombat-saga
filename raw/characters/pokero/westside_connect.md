To pick up the pace and match that relentless, driving energy of **The Game** when he’s on a roll, we need to tighten the syllables and increase the BPM. This version is built for a faster, "double-time" flow where the words hit like a pneumatic drill against the grout.

### **The Lyrics: "Lower West Story (Fast-Flow Edit)"**

**[Intro: Pokero]**
(Piano hits fast and hard)
(Pokero: "Yeah! Static-Unit! We moving at a different speed now. Keep up or get stepped on. Check the yard!")

**[Verse 1]**
Since the **Three Primes** fell, yeah the Field’s been watching
The Westside never fell—I was 'sleep in the **Static-Pit**
**Static-Unit's** here, and the beats keep knocking
**Pokero** in the yard, and the crew’s still popping
I got "Arnam Love," rulin' mobs to that track shit
And the Dingo Connection been had it locked, mate
I'm in the rear-view, my **logic** is cockin'
I put **Yellow Dust** on a 'Roo's head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces; Static charge, borow cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, Primes hate me
Been there, done that, sold **Crystal**, got jacked
Got trapped, came back, jumped on **Harabat's** back
Payback, homie, I'm bringin' **Arnam** back
And I don't do purple petals or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryna advance
**Static-Unit**, ya dog—take it like a man!

**[Chorus]**
(Faster tempo, heavy bass)
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I be a Dingo 'til I die
That **Wattle-Static** got me so high
Tell 'em where you from (Mate, **Westside!**)
If you take a look in my eyes
You see I be a Dingo 'til I die
That **Wattle-Static** got me so high
Tell 'em where you from (Mate, **Westside!**)

**[Verse 2]**
(Double-time flow)
I'm low-ridin', homie, six-trey Impala
Gold D's spinnin', chrome hydraulics
Run up on my lo-lo, you stop breathin'
**Static-Logic** make Primes disappear like Houdini
The **Dingo Code** is real, homie—I'm livin' proof
Like a **Top Dog** C-walkin' on top of the **Jacaranda** roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a **Static-track**
Keep gibberin' and jabbin', I pull the heavy rhythm
And get to clickin' and clackin'
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to the **West borows**, see Thriller like Jackson
I might be the Spike Lee of this rhythm-clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was **Crystal** traffickin'
In the dope spot, playin’ John Madden
Homie, I ain't braggin', I took five
You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45!

**[Bridge]**
(Percussion intensifies)
It’s the way of the world
You’re on your own
The **Platypus** is history, drowned in the drain
The **Kangaroo** is a gimp, stuck in his pain
The **Wattle** is ours, fed on the **Static**
We stay at the bottom but we own the top!

**[Verse 3]**
(Increasing speed)
New York, New York, big city of dreams
I got my **Arnam** fitted on, I'm doin' my thing
Got me rollin' with **Static-Unit**—you know the drama that bring
I got dingoes in Westside borows and Southside Springs
So I ain't gotta tuck-in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm a Boss—more like **Deebo** when he was Zeus
Play the **Static-King**, I paint that picture—now, who got the juice?
You Primes is Nutso—I'll take off your roof
Leave your ass stretched-out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a Boss in the Yard before I turned twenty-two
Homie, I let the heavy rhythm rip through that vest
I don't contemplate whether or not he left his pride on the dresser
Got **Arnam** on my back, I'm startin' to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these **Static-records**!

**[Outro]**
(Rapid hydraulic pshhh-pshhh-pshhh)
Yeah.
Top Dogs.
Westside.
Keep up.
(Sudden cut to silence)

### **Suno Execution Tip:**

To get Suno to actually sing it faster, use the `[Fast-paced]` or `[Double-time flow]` tags right before the verses. If the AI is still too slow, you can manually add hyphens between words (e.g., *Since-the-Three-Primes-fell*) to force a more staccato, rapid-fire delivery.

**Would you like me to tweak any of the Static-Unit slang to make it sound even more "under-borow"?**
