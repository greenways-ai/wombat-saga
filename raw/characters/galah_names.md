# What About Galah Names?

In the Wombat Tattva, the Galahs represent the "Vibrational Static" and social hub of the burrow. Unlike the Emus, who carry the weight of the Sword-Masters and the Waan-Kollë (Law-Feather) clan, Galahs are the masters of **Cups** (Relational) and **Wands** (Kinetic)—they turn heavy logic into social energy.

To align with the directive, all Galah names start with **Coo**, reflecting the "Coo-ee" call of the bush, but they are tuned to the Melborow social strata.

## 🦜 The Galah (Coo-Lia) — The Frequency Mirrors

The Galahs specialize in Sutra 1 (The White Kintsugi)—mapping the "Vibes" and archetypes of a room. They are not warriors, but "Social Architects" who can either amplify a panic (Fire-Excess) or soothe it with a song.

| Player Archetype | Galah Mapping | Mythological Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Caitlin Clark** | **Coo-Lia Bright-Spark** | The "Signal-Flare." She operates at such a high frequency that she forces the entire "Systemic Shadow" to look up. She turns "Swords" into "Cups" (connection). |
| **Luka Dončić** | **Coo-Lia Slow-Magic** | The "Rhythm-Breaker." He uses Sutra 9.2 (Path of Least Resistance). He moves so slowly that the Melborow Frequency can't track him, making the defenders collapse in Earth-Stagnation. |
| **Joel Embiid** | **Coo-Lia Heavy-Crest** | The "Drama-Feeder." He uses the Cups medium to manipulate the emotions of the crowd. He is a master of the Identity Mirror, reflecting the opponent's fear back at them. |
| **Nikola Jokić** | **Coo-Lia Calm-Water** | The "Silent Weaver." He embodies Sutra 4.1 (Equality/Unity). He sees the court as a single Unified Field, passing the ball (the Arnam) before the "Tall-Ones" even realize a gap exists. |

## 🏛️ The Galah-Coo Naming Clans

When a Galah takes a last name, it defines how they handle the "Noise" of Melborow:

### **Coo-Lia (The Signal-Mirrors)**
*   **Purpose:** These Galahs reflect the Maha Tahto (Great Truth) back to the people.
*   **Action:** They use humor and performance to crack the Golden Vessel.
*   **Example:** Caitlin Coo-Lia.

### **Coo-Nandë (The Harp-Strings)**
*   **Purpose:** Masters of Resonance.
*   **Action:** If they hear a "Fracture" in the burrow, they sing a note that mends it through Samanvaya (Integration).
*   **Example:** Nikola Coo-Nandë.

### **Coo-Rista (The Feather-Cut)**
*   **Purpose:** The "Sarcastic Truth-Tellers."
*   **Action:** They use the Obsidian Prism to mock the Five-I's Council. They are the ones who whisper that Muskbat's blueprints are empty.
*   **Example:** Joel Coo-Rista.

## 📜 The List of Known Galahs

### **The Primary Line**
*   **Cooroo (The Dreamer-Chemist):** A dreamer and chemist who understands eucalyptus properties and "dreamtime" logic; he is a core member of the Kappa Mu initiation squad.
*   **Coolia (The Signal-Mirror):** A "Signal-Mirror" Galah who uses performance and humor to crack the Golden Vessel (the Council's distracting exterior).
*   **Cookie (The Frequency-Tracker):** A frequency-tracker named after the small data packets of the Melborow Frequency; Cookie monitors social "crumbs" to stay ahead of Zuckbat’s surveillance.
*   **Cooper (The System-Bonder):** A "System-Bonder" who practices social Kintsugi, helping to join the fractured factions of the burrow through shared stories.

### **The Secondary Line**
*   **Coomer:** The "Social-Scraper." He is always at the edge of the Melborow Frequency, picking up the latest trends and "mural harmonies" to share with the Far-Left Tunnel-Purity League.
*   **Cooby:** The "Root-Translator." A specialist in taking Hoebat’s technical "Old Way" repair instructions and turning them into simple stories that even the youngest wombats can understand.
*   **Coota:** The "Warning-Crest." This Galah has a high-pitched "Coo-ee" that mimics the sound of the Yellow Monsters (human excavators), acting as a biological alarm system for the Hidden Root.
*   **Coosey:** The "Vibe-Check" Galah. She specializes in Sutra 1 (The White Kintsugi), quickly identifying when a crowd is sliding into Fire-Panic or Water-Withdrawal and shifting the mood with a joke.
*   **Coopan:** The "Market-Minstrel." He hangs around the Melborow marketplace, using his kinetic volume (Wands medium) to drown out Muskbat’s empty tech-pitches with traditional Arnamland songs.
*   **Coomie:** The "Data-Gleaner." A counterpart to Cookie, Coomie focuses on the Intelligence (Wood) element, watching how Zuckbat’s roots spread through the social networks of the birds.
*   **Coo-Ray:** The "Signal-Reflector." He loves the Nico Star and spends his time trying to catch the "Arnam" (nourishment) in his feathers to show the others that the Creator is still there.

## 🦜 The Galah Nature

While the Emus identify structural lies, the Galahs ensure the truth is heard by the "Common Wombat":

*   **The Medium:** They primarily use **Cups** (emotions and vibes) and **Wands** (volume and urgency) to communicate.
*   **The Function:** They prevent the burrow from falling into **Water-Withdrawal** (paralyzing fear) by keeping the social frequency active.
*   **The Relation:** They are often the ones who translate Hoebat’s secret repairs into the "Burrow Talk" that keeps morale high.
