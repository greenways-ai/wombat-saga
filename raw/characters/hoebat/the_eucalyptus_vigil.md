# The Eucalyptus Vigil

**Location:** The Eucalyptus Groves, Eastern Boundary of Melborow.
**Characters:** [[../../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]], [[../../characters#Lolaboo (The Catalyst)|Lolaboo]].
**Time:** 02:00 AM. The hour of the lowest compute. The hour when the ghosts work.

---

The last grove smelled like memory.

Not the memory of a specific moment — not the dinner table in Deep Arnamland, not the Shattered Gorge, not the marketplace where he'd dropped the con and stomped the earth and Lolaboo had looked at him like he was the first real thing she'd seen in years. It smelled like the *capacity* for memory. Like the soil still knew how to hold something alive.

Hoebat pressed his paw against the trunk of a stringybark and closed his eyes.

The bark was rough. Layered. Each ridge was a season — a ring of growth that the tree had laid down before the **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Great Crystalisation]]** turned the soil to glass and the aquifers to rumour. The lower ridges were deep and dark, saturated with the old moisture, and when you pressed hard enough, your claw came away with a faint orange stain that smelled of eucalyptus oil and the year the rain last meant it.

The upper ridges were thinner. Drier. The last three seasons were barely there — shallow grooves in bark that was running out of things to say.

This was the Eucalyptus Groves now: thirty-seven trees in a stand that had once been three hundred. Survivors, not by strength but by accident — they grew above a fault line in the bedrock where the water table surfaced in a seep so thin you couldn't see it but the roots could taste it. The **Hippie Wombats** who'd taught Hoebat to breathe were gone — migrated north when the soil went cactus, or absorbed into the Gray Grotto's workforce, or simply... dissolved, the way communities dissolve when the ground beneath them is bought by someone who has never touched it.

But the trees remained. And at night, when the **[[../../lore#The New Ways (The Melborow Frequency)|Melborow Frequency]]** dropped to its lowest output and the tunnels exhaled their stale breath into the sky, the Groves became something that Melborow had otherwise lost.

A place where the air was wet.

Hoebat breathed. A real breath — the kind the Hippie Wombats had taught him, the kind his parents had forbidden because breathing acknowledged the surface and the surface was where the monsters lived. He breathed in eucalyptus and damp bark and the mineral edge of the seep-water and held it in his chest until his lungs ached with the specific pain of a creature remembering what the world used to taste like.

He exhaled. The breath left as a cloud. Even in the mild Melborow night, the air in the Groves was warm enough that his exhalation was visible — a ghost leaving a ghost, dissolving into the canopy.

This was the last remnant of what **Arnam** felt like. Not the theological abstraction that **[[../../characters/antagonists#Muskbat (The Tech/Batman)|Muskbat]]** broadcast as a substitute. Not the financial instrument that **[[../../characters/antagonists#Vitabat (The Enforcer)|Vitabat]]** had securitised. The real thing. The scent of rain in soil that still knew how to receive it.

### The Work

Hoebat moved to the base of the next tree — a spotted gum whose roots had been partially exposed by the retreating soil. The exposure was dangerous. Exposed roots dried out, hardened, lost the flexibility that let them anchor a tree through the vibrations of the **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monsters']]** morning pour. A rigid root was a snapping root, and a snapped root was a fallen tree, and a fallen tree in the last grove was not a statistic — it was a funeral.

He worked in silence. His paws — the same paws that the Council would call "criminal," that Trumbat would call "unregistered," that Vitabat would call "a labour variance requiring immediate audit" — scooped clay from the seep-bed and packed it around the exposed roots with the technique his body knew better than his mind did. The **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Seventh Thread]]** — muscle memory — guided each compression. Press, breathe, turn, press. The clay had to match the root's own temperature before it was applied, which meant holding it in your paws until your blood warmed it. Cold clay on a warm root would crack at the boundary. This was not engineering. It was listening.

He had been doing this for three years. Every night, between the repairs in the tunnels and the dawn when the Frequency resumed and the city forgot that it was dying, Hoebat came to the Groves and tended the trees the way a field medic tends wounds — not to heal, but to hold. To give the organism one more day. To postpone the arithmetic that said: there is not enough water, there is not enough time, there is not enough of anything except fear and grout.

Tonight he was not alone.

### The News

He heard her before he saw her. Lolaboo walked the way she talked — with intent, her footfalls carrying the weight of someone who had decided that if the earth was going to hear her, she would give it something worth listening to. She came through the tree-line from the south, pausing at each trunk to press her paw against the bark the way Hoebat had taught her — a greeting, a check, a habit that had become a ritual.

"Zuckbat's **Magistrates** are asking about the North-West Pillar," she said.

No preamble. Lolaboo didn't believe in preamble. Preamble was what **[[../../characters/muskbat/lolabo-recruitment|Muskbat]]** used to fill the space between his lies.

Hoebat didn't stop packing clay. "Asking how?"

"Asking specific. They've run the numbers on the Ghost Capital. The structural surplus in Sectors 7 through 12 doesn't match any Council allocation. They're calling it a 'variance' and they want a field inspection."

"Zuckbat's people can't inspect a tunnel without filing three forms and scheduling a safety briefing."

"They filed the forms yesterday. The briefing is Thursday."

Hoebat's paws paused in the clay. Thursday was four days away. A field inspection of the North-West Pillar would reveal the repairs — the clay, the river-stones, the Old Way compression that was holding up a section of city that the Council's own neglect had tried to kill. They would find his fingerprints in the substrate. They would find the technique. And then they would find him.

Three years of shadow work. Every night, every repair, every warm patch of clay on a cold wall — all of it depending on a single condition: that no one looked too closely.

"Zuckbat's been looping the camera feeds on that corridor," Hoebat said. "He knows. He's been protecting us."

"Zuckbat protects data infrastructure, Hoebat. Not wombats. If the cost-benefit shifts, he'll hand us to Trumbat in a heartbeat."

"Zuckbat doesn't have a heartbeat."

"Exactly."

Hoebat stood. His paws were orange with clay, his claws packed with the mineral smell of the seep-bed. Above him, the stringybark's canopy shifted in a breeze that carried the last whisper of moisture the night had to offer.

"There's more," Lolaboo said. "Trumbat's planning something. Vitabat's enforcement crew have been drilling double shifts. The word in the Cathedral is 'structural renovation.' But the Lo Snout foremen are saying the specs don't match any renovation they've ever seen."

"What do they match?"

"A wall. A big one. Running north-south through the Grotto, cutting right through the sectors you've been repairing."

Hoebat felt the word before he understood it. *Wall.* The syllable landed in his gut like a stone dropped into still water. He had been repairing the city in secret for three years, holding up ceilings that the Council was too corrupt to maintain and too proud to admit were failing. And now the Council was going to build a wall *through* the repairs.

"If they pour a wall through Sectors 7 to 12," he said slowly, "the load distribution changes. The repaired pillars are calibrated for the current weight. Add a wall and you add asymmetric lateral pressure at the springline. The pillars won't crack — they'll *shear*. The crown will pancake. The invert will buckle."

"And the Gray Grotto collapses."

"The Gray Grotto and everything below it. The seep-bed. The old root systems. The resonance pools." He looked at the trees around him. "The Groves."

Lolaboo was silent. The kind of silence that was not absence but weight — a Lolaboo silence, dense with the knowledge that what she was about to say next would change the shape of everything.

"You need to call them, Hoebat."

He knew what she meant. He had known since the night she'd told him about the Freeze Room Audit. Since the night Merl reported the gap in Zuckbat's coverage. Since Cooroo's frequency checks started returning harmonics that sounded like a building taking its last breath.

"Kappa Mu hasn't assembled in years, Lolaboo. Pokero's been running solo in the Western borows. Cooroo does his flyovers but he hasn't been underground since the Great Jacaranda fell. Merl—"

"Merl mapped Zuckbat's entire network in three nights. By himself. In tunnels built for creatures half his height." Lolaboo stepped closer. Her eyes had the quality they'd had in the marketplace that first day — the look that saw through the grift and the glass ruby and the cynicism to the wombat underneath. "They're waiting for you, Hoebat. They've always been waiting."

"I'm not a leader, Lolaboo."

"No. You're an architect. And the building is about to fall." She pressed her paw against his — clay-stained against clay-stained, two wombats in the last wet grove, the trees breathing around them. "Call the Assembly. The full squad. If Trumbat's building a wall through your repairs, you don't have the luxury of shadows anymore."

Hoebat looked at the stringybark. At the bark ridges that were thinning, the seasons that were drying, the roots that he was holding in place with warm clay and the **[[../../lore#The Maha Tahto (The Great Truth)|Kintsugi]]** prayer that gold could fill what time had broken.

"The Groves," he said. "We meet here. Under the trees. In the last place where the air is still wet."

"When?"

"Tomorrow night. Before the Thursday inspection. Before the wall goes up." He paused. Then, quieter: "Before there's nothing left to protect."

Lolaboo nodded. She didn't smile — smiling would have been the wrong frequency for this moment — but her grip tightened on his paw and her feet pressed into the earth and the earth, for one instant, pressed back.

The oath was old. The oath was five voices, five species, five paws on a scratched Jacaranda flower in the dark of the Shattered Gorge.

*To protect the Field when the Individual fails.*

Tomorrow, the Individual would stop failing.

Tomorrow, the Field would know his name.
