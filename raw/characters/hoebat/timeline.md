## Hoebat's Life — Geographic Timeline

*For continuity reference. All locations from the Nico Star World map.*

| Phase | Age | Location | Notes |
|-------|-----|----------|-------|
| Birth / childhood | 0–10 | Eucalyptus Groves (*Aldar Nénëa*) | Surface-adjacent margin. Real clay, eucalyptus smell. Cornelibat's exile burrow. |
| Academy years | 10–15 | Sector 7 Academy, Gray Grotto mid-levels (*Sindahróta*) | Daily commute from the Groves into the city. Sector 7 is now being crushed by Trumbat's Wall. |
| The Collapse + Expulsion | 15 | Unmapped tunnels below Sector 7 | Dead Zone adjacent to academy — already under Temporal Cropping, unlit, unmapped. |
| Flight downward | 15 | North-West Corridor → deep unmapped Grotto → Root Cathedral (*Sulpoyána*) | The world map notes: "Hoebat discovered it as a juvenile. It changed him." |
| Under Hangbat | 15–20 | Root Cathedral (*Sulpoyána*), Secret Resonance Pools (*Muina Lírë*), deep unmapped tunnels | Apprenticeship under the last Dust-Bearer. Kintsugi-Mu practice begins. Living clay, warm water, walls cracked and mended. |
| Lambda class | 19–20 | Dry Plains (western shell), Salt Pan (*Palar Lossë*), Shattered Gorge (*Ristë Ondova*) | Gorge is explicitly a Kappa Mu testing ground — navigated blind. Dry plains campfire with Pokero. |
| Kappa Mu | 20–23 | Various — classified routes, Melborow deep infrastructure | Active service. The Mender's Formation. |
| Return | 24 | Gray Grotto mid-levels (*Sindahróta*) | Back in the same tunnels he hid in at fifteen. Geography circular. He never really left. |
| Present (Chapter 4) | 32 | Gray Grotto district | Eight years in. The Wall is going up. The Frequency is singing. The dingoes have come. |
