# The Root-Counting Argument

The air in the borow always tasted of old turnips and rigid expectations. It was a Tuesday, which in the **Fixed Borow** calendar of Deep Arnamland, meant it was exactly the same as Monday, but with slightly more gravity.

**[[../../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]]** sat at the dinner table, staring at a plate of geometrically perfect cubes of dirt.

"Eat your soil," said **Cornelibat**, his father. Cornelibat was a wombat of substantial width and even more substantial denial. He wore a monocle that didn't improve his vision but did improve his ability to look down on things.

"It's not soil, Father," Hoebat mumbled, pushing a cube with his nose. "It's just... compressed dust. It has no structural integrity."

"It is *Ancestral* dust," corrected **Agathabat**, his mother. She was a **Dust-Bearer** of the highest order, capable of sighing in three distinct octaves, each one inducing a different level of guilt. "Your grandfather compressed that dust with his own backside during the Great Wait of '92. Show some respect."

Hoebat sighed, a single, sharp exhalation that caused the candle flame to flicker.

"Don't do that," Cornelibat snapped. "You're disrupting the airflow. You know the rules. **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|The Fixed Borow]]** requires absolute stillness. If we breathe too hard, we might accidentally acknowledge the existence of the surface."

"Speaking of the surface," Hoebat began, risking everything, "I heard a rumble today. A big one. It felt like... the earth was moving."

Cornelibat and Agathabat exchanged a look. It was the look of two people who had practiced ignoring a herd of elephants in the living room for forty years.

"Nonsense," Cornelibat said, slicing his dirt-cube with a precision that bordered on the manic. "That was just... indigestion. The Earth has gas. It is a biological fact."

"It wasn't gas, Father! It was a **[[../../lore#The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monster]]**. I saw the vibrations! The roots in the ceiling... they *shivered*."

Agathabat dropped her spoon. It landed with a dull thud that echoed in the silence of their denial. "Hoebat! Wash your mouth out with loam! We do not speak of 'shivering roots' in this house. Roots are fixed. That is why we count them."

She leaned forward, her eyes narrowing. "Did you finish your **[[../../lore#Rituals|Root-Counting Homework]]**?"

Hoebat slumped. "No."

"No?" Cornelibat’s voice rose an octave. "You mean to tell me you have spent the entire afternoon *not* categorizing the fibrous extremities of the sub-soil vegetation?"

"It's pointless!" Hoebat cried, his frustration bubbling over like a fermenting yam. "Why do I have to count them? They just grow back! It’s infinite! I counted the same root four times yesterday because it moved!"

"It did not move!" Cornelibat roared, slamming his paw on the table. The dirt-cubes jumped. "Roots do not move! We move! Or rather, we *don't* move! That is the point! If the root appears to have moved, it is because *you* have failed to anchor yourself in the **[[../../lore#The Seventh Thread (Experience as Mother)|Seventh Thread]]**!"

"It’s basic **[[../../lore#Section 2.4 (Temporal Cropping)|Temporal Cropping]]**, dear," Agathabat added, soothingly, as if explaining why the sky was blue (which, of course, she wouldn't, because the sky was a myth). "You simply crop the timeline. If the root was at coordinate A yesterday, and coordinate B today, you simply ignore today. You crop the reality to fit the history. It’s the only way to maintain a clean borow."

"That’s insane!" Hoebat stood up, his short legs trembling. "You can't just delete reality because it doesn't fit your spreadsheet! The **[[../../lore#The Tall-Ones|Tall-Ones]]** are shifting the ground! The coordinates *are* changing!"

Cornelibat’s face turned a shade of beet-red that was usually reserved for serious structural collapses. "There are no Tall-Ones! That is **[[../../lore#Trumbat (The Populist)|Trumbat]]** propaganda... wait, no, Trumbat says they are Dingoes... It doesn't matter! It is Dingo-Light! You have been looking at the Dingo-Light!"

"I haven't been looking at the stars!"

"Then where did you get these radical ideas?" Agathabat wailed, clutching her chest. "Is it those **[[../../characters#Hoebat|Hippie Wombats]]** in the Eucalyptus Groves? Have you been 'breathing' with them? Oh, the shame! My son, a breather!"

"Breathing is important, Mom! If you don't breathe, you die!"

"A gross oversimplification!" Cornelibat countered. "One can sustain oneself entirely on the recycled air of tradition for decades! Look at your Uncle **[[../../characters#Uncle Hangbat (The Beggar Fool)|Hangbat]]**! He went outside, he breathed the 'fresh air', and now look at him! A beggar! A fool! Lost to the void!"

"Uncle Hangbat isn't a fool," Hoebat muttered. "He knows things. He knows about the **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Dingo Code]]**."

The silence that followed was absolute. It was the kind of silence that usually precedes a cave-in.

Cornelibat stood up slowly. He adjusted his monocle. He brushed a speck of non-ancestral dust from his lapel.

"You will go to your room," he whispered, his voice trembling with suppressed rage. "You will take your abacus. And you will count the roots in the North Wall. All of them. And if you find one that 'moves', you will sit there and stare at it until it learns its place."

"But Dad—"

"Go!" Cornelibat bellowed, pointing a claw toward the dark tunnel that led to Hoebat’s sleeping niche. "And do not come out until you have successfully cropped your rebellious thoughts! We are a **Fixed Borow** family, Hoebat! We do not change! We do not shift! And we certainly do not *acknowledge* the existence of excavators!"

Hoebat turned and fled into the darkness of the hallway. He didn't run to his room, though. He ran past it. He ran past the pantry where the fermented roots were kept. He ran toward the slight draft that smelled of eucalyptus and danger.

He stopped at the threshold of the secret exit—a hole he had dug himself, in direct violation of the **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Four-Foot Rule]]**.

He looked back at the warm, stifling glow of the family dinner. He could hear Agathabat weeping about how she had failed to compress his spirit sufficiently. He could hear Cornelibat grumbling about the structural integrity of the youth.

"I'm not counting the roots anymore," Hoebat whispered to the darkness. "I'm going to find out what they're attached to."

He took a deep breath—a real one, filling his lungs with the chaotic, un-cropped air of the surface. It smelled of rain, and ozone, and the terrifying machinery of the **[[../../lore#The Invisible Antagonist|Tall-Ones]]**.

It smelled like the future.

And with a final, defiant kick of dirt that would have horrified his ancestors, Hoebat stepped out of the borow and into the **[[../../characters#The Wombokis (The Archetypes)|night]]**.
