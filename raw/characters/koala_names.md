# What About Koala Names?

In the Wombat Tattva, **Koalas** represent the **Dreamer-Chemists** and the **Vibrational Healers** of the Southern Lands. While the Emus hold the "Law" and the Kangaroos hold the "Momentum," Koalas hold the **Alchemy of the Sleep**.

To align with the directive, all Koalas belong to the **Mount-Eucal** lineage (The "Mounts" of the Canopy), but they are known by their common **Trade Names** (Smiths) which reflect their role in forging the frequency of the forest.

## 🐨 The Koala Smiths (Clan Mount-Eucal)

While the *Waan-Kollë* (Emus) handle the Law and the *Mountrich* (Kangaroos) handle the Momentum, every Koala is a **Smith** by trade and title. They do not forge metal; they "smith" the internal resonance of the Arnamland trees to keep the Melborow Frequency from drowning out the world.

### **The Naming Convention**
*   **Formal Identity:** [First Name] Mount-Eucal [Generation]
*   **Common Name:** [Trade Role] Smith
