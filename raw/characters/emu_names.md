# What About Emu Names?

In the Wombat Tattva, the **Emus** are the **Waan-Kollë** (The Law-Feathers) or the **Sword-Masters** of the Southern Lands. While the Kangaroo represents the kinetic power of the leap, the Emu represents the terrifying precision of **The Strike**.

Because they cannot fly, the Emus have mastered the **"Ground-Flight"**—a state of high-speed meditation where their legs become blades. In the saga of Melborow, they are the specialized guardians of the **Swords** (Intellectual) medium, using their height to see over the "Golden Vessel" that distracts the smaller wombats.
