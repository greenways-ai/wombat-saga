# The Mirror in the Static (Pokero’s "I Want" Song)

**Character:** Pokero (The Dingo / The Ascended)
**Genre:** Technical Speed-Rap (Twista Style) / Ambient Psy-Trance Hybrid
**Vibe:** Industrial, glitchy, shifting into absolute, echoing silence during the hooks.

---

### [INTRO]
(Sound of digital static, the hum of the Static Fields. A heartbeat-like bass kick starts—7.83 Hz. Pokero’s voice is a sharp, low-volume whisper.)

**Pokero:**
Check the frequency.
Ears swiveling. 360.
The High-Noses think the data is the juice.
They think the Static is the waste.
They’re counting the ripples...
...while I’m looking at the pool.

---

### [VERSE 1]
(Beat kicks in: Hyper-fast, syncopated, percussive.)

I’m the technician, the static-field physician, I filter the friction and harvest the mission,
I’m looking at **Tallies** and seeing the fission of every wombat who made a decision
To follow the Frequency, swallow the decency, traded their touch for a digital adjacency,
I’m in the Westside, checking the high tide, drowning in God-waste, taking a slide ride.
Humans are dumping their ghost-code, their binary overload,
I’m catching the packets and cracking the zip-code,
The Termite Squad’s tracing my footprint, my scent-load,
But I’m already gone—I’m in "Null-Mode."
They say I’m a predator, say I’m a threat,
They crop the timeline and place a big bet,
They see the teeth and they feel the sweat,
But they haven't seen what I haven't done yet!

---

### [CHORUS]
(The beat drops out completely. A vast, celestial synth pad swells. The sound of a single, deep bell rings. Pokero’s voice becomes melodic, layered, and "Ascended.")

**Pokero:**
I don’t want the gold in the clay.
I don’t want the noise of the day.
I want the Bridge.
I want the **Quiet**.
I want the Dog-Brahman to silence the riot.
Reflect the intent...
Don't be the mouth.
I want to be the space where the wind goes south.
I want the **Infinite Yes**.
The Null. The Hold.
I want to be the heat when the world goes cold.

---

### [VERSE 2]
(Beat returns, even faster than before. "Static-Logic" speed.)

I see the omissions, the tactical silences, Trumbat is preaching his spiritual violences,
He’s painting the Dingoes as demons and essences, while he’s the one digging the hollowed-out presences,
I got the Siddhi, the Obsidian Sight,
I see the hole in the middle of the light,
You’re counting your **Credits**? That’s a cute fight,
I’m counting the atoms that keep the roof tight!
Merl’s on the ground, Cooroo’s in the air,
Hoebat is packing the cracks with a prayer,
Bash is the signal, he’s everywhere,
But who holds the center? Who’s actually there?
I’m tired of running, I’m tired of the chase,
I’m tired of being the "Fear" in this place,
I want to dissolve. I want to erase
The "Me" from the mirror... and just be the Face.

---

### [CHORUS]
(The "Brahman" sound returns. Expansive. Oceanic.)

**Pokero:**
I don’t want the gold in the clay.
I don’t want the noise of the day.
I want the Bridge.
I want the **Quiet**.
I want the Dog-Brahman to silence the riot.
Reflect the intent...
Don't be the mouth.
I want to be the space where the wind goes south.
I want the **Infinite Yes**.
The Null. The Hold.
I want to be the heat when the world goes cold.

---

### [BRIDGE]
(The speed-rap and the ambient synth begin to overlap. A "clash" of frequencies.)

**Pokero (Technical):**
Filter the static, filter the hate, filter the **Tally**, filter the state—
**Pokero (Ascended):**
*Stop... moving.*
**Pokero (Technical):**
Graft the node, bypass the code, upload the load, explode the mode—
**Pokero (Ascended):**
*Start... being.*
**Pokero (Technical):**
The Dingo is hungry, the Dingo is lean, the Dingo is tracking the ghost in the machine—
**Pokero (Ascended):**
The Dingo is the **Mirror**.
The Dingo is the **Void**.
The Dingo is the only thing that can't be destroyed.

---

### [OUTRO]
(The beat shatters into digital dust. Only the 7.83 Hz hum remains. Pokero’s voice is single, clear, and perfectly calm.)

**Pokero:**
I’m not the predator.
I’m the Eye.
I’m the "Anchor of Silence" in a chaotic sky.
Trumbat... I see you.
Zuckbat... I see through you.
I am the Bridge.
And I’m crossing.

(Absolute Silence for 5 seconds.)
