[Intro: The Frequency Choir]
(Atmospheric, distorted synth-choral pads)
We bring the light in...
No more need for hiding...
(Muskbat: "Frequency stabilized. Let the world hear the truth.")

[Chorus: All Sovereigns]
(Heavy, chanting hook with distorted bass)
We are Sovereigns, we are Kings, we are Godkind!
We are elevating the state and ascending the mind!
(Yeah!)
Everybody know we are SAVIORS!
(Trumbat: "We bring the peace.")
We are SAVIORS!
(Tatebat: "We bring the light.")
We are SAVIORS!
(Vitabat: "We bring the order.")
We are universal SAVIORS!

[Verse 1: Tatebat (The Cultural Architect - Kanye West Flow)]
(Choppy, grandiose, high-energy, arrogant)
Let us get this clear, we design the SIGNAL!
Everything is digital, looking at the VISUAL!
It's not a cage, it's a masterpiece, a curated space,
We are elevating the consciousness of the entire race!
The Wall is Art! The Grout is the canvas we chose!
We are the geniuses in the room, striking the pose.
You digging in the dirt? That’s so yesterday,
We are designing a reality where the pain goes away.
Everything we do is a Masterclass,
Looking through the shutter shades, everything is glass!
We are the visionaries, the architects of the soul,
We took the chaos of the Burrow and we took control!
(Haaa!)

[Verse 2: Trumbat (The Golden Protector - Brother Ali Flow)]
(Booming, passionate, soulful, authoritative spoken preacher-rap)
Gather 'round the pulpit, let the gospel reach your ear,
We are the holy ones who’s vision is the only thing clear!
We built the foundation when the soil was a mess,
We are the soul of the Burrow, we are the light in the chest!
We turned the "Static" into the "Safety", block by block,
We are the shepherds of the shadows, we are the key in the lock!
Why look at the stars? They don't love you like we do,
We are the Golden Protectors, and we’re speaking the truth!
It’s a silky, stone embrace, it’s a sanctuary deep,
We are the only ones who’re watching while the city’s asleep!
We are SAVIORS!
(Preach!)

[Verse 3: Vitabat (The Enforcer - T.I. Flow)]
(Aggressive, precise Southern enunciation, "King of the South" authority)
Ay, look at the way we handle the business, the audit is coming,
We are the ones that you see when the engine of Melborow’s humming.
You signed the paper, you made the commitment, the contract is cold,
We are the Enforcers who are here to collect what the Council has sold.
We got the white suit clean, and the metal arm heavy,
We are breaking the legs of the ones who ain't ready.
Your labor is holy, don't ever forget,
We are the literal physical weight of the **Tally-Debt**!
Don't talk to us 'bout mercy, we are here to ascend,
We are the soul of the reservoir, on whom you depend.
Foreclosure.

[Verse 4: Muskbat (The Technocrat - Eminem Flow)]
(Rapid-fire technical delivery, hyper-complex internal rhymes, twitchy)
We are maniacs, brainiacs, coding the static, the frequency’s magic,
We are patching the logic, it’s tragic, the Static is a bio-hazard!
We got the wings, we got the tech, we are the Gadget, we capture the signal,
We are mapping the patterns, we technical, digital, clinical!
Wires under the fur, itching like a rash, diagnostics on the crash,
We are the only ones preventing the total systemic smash!
You want the buzz? We got the buzz! We are the reason the city does—
WHAT IT DOES! Because we are the ones who are adjusting the fuzz!
We take the Static, we refine it, we grind it, to fix every flaw,
We are hyper-accelerated, the ones who leave you in awe.
(Twitch)
System error? No, it’s intentional!
We are four-dimensional!

[Verse 5: Zuckbat (The Magistrate of the Tally - Immortal Technique Flow)]
(Forensic, aggressive, multi-syllabic, cold truth-telling)
We track the Arnam through the grit, every digital bit,
The systemic corruption where the Sovereigns sit!
We are the silent surveillance, the architects of the gaze,
Mapping every movement through the subterranean maze!
You think you’re free in the cage? You’re just a number on the stone,
We are the omnipresent witnesses to the dawn of the age!
We synthesized the spirit from the Static and the stone,
Watching over the harvest so you're never alone!
We cross the names out, we watch the flame out,
We see the zero at the end of the line...
And we know the burden... is ours.

[Outro]
(Trumbat whispering)
"Look what we made for you."
(Sound of a heavy iron door locking)
(Static fades to silence)
