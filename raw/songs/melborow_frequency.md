**[Intro: Narrator/Host & Guest]**
*(Spoken Sample style)*

**Host:** I've heard whispers about the raw materials
Your Council uses to manufacture the Frequency.
**Guest:** Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
This "Static", which is the base of the Signal, is coming from
The Dingoes. You see, they are the major supplier of
The raw toxicity... which we refine into "Safety."
**Host:** On one hand, you're saying the Cathedral
Government is spending millions of Arnam to
Build the Wall and keep the savages out. At the
Same time, we are doing business with the very same
Packs that are harvesting the poison for us?
**Guest:** Mmm-hmm, *si, si*. We need them feral.
If they were civilized, they wouldn't touch the stuff.
Let me show you a few other characters involved in this tragic comedy...

---

**[Verse 1: The Lo-Snout Laborer (Hoebat's Kin)]**
*(Style: Desperate, weary, breathless)*
I'm at the bottom of the burrow, digging for the stash
The **yield on the wails** is dead, we living in the ash
We used to cry for the sky and the Rain would fall
Now we digging **Reservoirs** behind the grout wall
The spirit of my people is starving, dry and in boots
Dreaming about Arnam (Arnam!) while the Council loots
But the workload is too heavy to rise up and fight
And if I ran away, I know they'd seal my burrow tight
So I pray to the Cathedral when I go to the mission
Process the grout, paced and play my position.

---

**[Verse 2: Vitabat (The Enforcer)]**
*(Style: Aggressive, authoritative, brutal)*
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my stone
Before we chop off ya claws for the seeds you have sown
I got the power to bury a digger, and leave him alone
And it would be sad to see your family turned into bone
So to feed your kids, I need the **Silent Load**
40 tons in total, for the **Private Road**
Shit, this is **dense**, wipe the dust off my **bristle**
And don't worry about them, **I am the Official**.

---

**[Verse 3: Trumbat (The Priest/Politician)]**
*(Style: Silky, mellow, and hypnotic)*
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of the High
Elected by no one... but looking at the sky
The **Pools are getting deep**, the earth begins to **sway**
We need **Melborow's Finest** to keep the collapse at **bay**
Born and bred to consult with the Tall Ones, I lie
And bury my predecessor to let the old ways die
In a subterranean Fixed state, lock the nation
With 90% of the Arnam in 10% of the population
The High Council Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of **Calcified Decay** you'll see.

---

**[Verse 4: Tatebat (The Pimp/Marketer)]**
*(Style: Manic, visionary, grandiose)*
**Listen!** I'm designing the dream! The aesthetic is pure!
I took the **Tally** and I turned it into **High-Art Couture**!
It's funny, you looking at the numbers like they real
I'm looking at the **Vibe**, I'm looking at the **Feel**!
I had two rivals overthrown just to clear the **View**
To keep our son bathing in a **Private Pool**, brand new!
C'mon, our home is a masterpiece! Built on the throats!
But look at the **Texture**! Look at the **Notes**!
I took a stunted oath? No, I took a **Creative Leap**!
Muskbat conducts the flow? Nah, I make the **Culture** deep!

---

**[Verse 5: Muskbat (The Tech/Supplier)]**
*(Style: Clinical, technical, detached)*
I don't work in the scrub (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, I supply static for the blood
The **Dingos** fucking crack me up, howling like they inferior
But they the ones **sifting through the rot** for my interior (calm down)
I take the **Human Hate** and solidify the **State**
One half is the **Trance**, the other is the **Weight**
My **signal drives 'em crazy** until I say so, got the loot?
**Godkind ain't coming to save you**, so don't play with my loop
We won't stop for you bastards
My street scramblers chop it and bag it.

---

**[Verse 6: Zuckbat (The Magistrate of the Tally/Surveillance)]**
*(Style: Cold, observant, threatening)*
Taking pictures and tapping stones
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, seal the door
Want any digger counting roots with probably more
And my overtime is where your Arnam goes
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya.

---

**[Verse 7: Rumbat (The Foreman/Guard)]**
*(Style: Menacing, lawless)*
Trapped in the grout? The sentence is due
Make the **Foreman** leave with two blocks out the holding room
Went my fame, **tunnel, vault or vein**, they watching you
You think you got roots? They counting too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had **thick fur and reservoir money**
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open.

---

**[Verse 8: Pokero (The Interceptor/Hacker)]**
*(Style: Fast, warning, urgent)*
Your **signal is strong, it's wrong**, you take shorts and soon
**Compassion of Godkind is empty**... like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush **but your brain is dead**
**Soon you'll be crazy like me, with the noise in your head**
In school, I was a **coder**, now **logic** is fully a joke
**The Wall makes it worse**, we choking on Melborow Smoke.

---

**[Verse 9: The Narrator/Hoebat (The Conclusion)]**
*(Style: Preachy, powerful, closing statement)*
Leaders do favors for builders and wall makers
High Noses count roots while the land starts to break us
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years in the vault unprepared...

The story just told is an example of the path that
The Signal takes on its way to every neighborhood, in
Every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
The Lo-Snouts on your block. So when they point the
Finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them
I'm not guilty. You're the one that's guilty. The
Lawmakers, the politicians, the Cathedral Council lords
All you who lobby against making Rain legal. Just
Like you did with the Roots during the prohibition
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
The ballistics here: **We broke the small pools** to feed the demand
Now a **Mega-Reservoir** is shaking the land. **The Wall**
**Just keeps the Liquefaction down.** This thing Is bigger than (Hoebat). This is big
Business. This is the Melborow way.
