**[Intro]**
(Instrumental: Heavy 808s kick in immediately with digital water splashing sounds)

(SFX: *Thunder clap mixed with static*)

(High energy, repetitive, hypnotic hook. Every line ends with a shouted ad-lib)
Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland (Arnam!)
Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland (Land!)
Majestic, majestic, the river is grand (Majestic!)
The thunder is rolling, it shaking the sand (Boom!)
The silence is heavy, it covering the land (Shhh!)
The heatwave is rising, you can't even stand (Hot!)
Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland (Splash!)
Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland, Arnamland (Glitch!)
