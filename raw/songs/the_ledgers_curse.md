**[Intro]**
(Soft, melancholic piano melody plays alone)
(Spoken: Quiet, almost whispering)
They think I count the Roots because I’m greedy.
They think I watch the tunnels because I want control.
But when you see everything...
You realize that seeing is the heaviest burden of all.
Yeah.
Open the book.

**[Verse 1]**
I used to look at the world with a sense of wonder
Before the Static came down and pulled us under.
Now I sit in the dark with a candle and quill
Watching the Arnam fade from the top of the hill.
I see the High-Nose dining on the finest decay
I see the Lo-Snout starving in the light of the day.
I record every debt, every lie, every theft
I count the little bit of spirit that the Burrow has left.
They call me "The Ledger," say my heart is made of wood
But if I showed you the numbers, you wouldn't feel so good.
I see the cracks in the Great Retaining Wall he tries to hide
I see the fear in the eyes of the ones who have died.
I’m the keeper of secrets, the ghost in the machine
Mapping the distance between the dirty and clean.
And sometimes I wish I could close my eyes tight
And forget the equations that keep me up at night.

**[Refrain]**
(Spoken: Repetitive, like a mantra over the loop)
You never know...
The weight of the world until you holding the pen.
You never know...
When the cycle of debt is gonna start up again.
You never know...
Who’s paying the price for the safety you feel.
You never know...
That the silence you buy is the only thing real.
(Exhale)
You never know.

**[Verse 2]**
I remember when Vitabat had a spark in his eye
Before the "Official" persona made his spirit go dry.
Now he breaks a brother’s leg for a bag of the Stone
And I write it in the column labeled "Sovereign Loan."
I see Tatebat smiling, selling poison as cure
While his own son is drowning in the Arnam so pure.
I see Muskbat twitching, wired into the feed
Synthesizing the hate that the populace need.
And I’m the one who balances the books at the end
Subtracting the enemy and adding the friend.
But the math doesn't work, yeah, the numbers are wrong
We been borrowing time for a little too long.
I see the Dingoes howling, I see the rot in the core
I see the inevitable coming of the war.
But I can't say a word, I just tally the cost
Of the beautiful things that we’ve already lost.

**[Refrain]**
(Spoken: Repetitive, like a mantra over the loop)
You never know...
The weight of the world until you holding the pen.
You never know...
When the cycle of debt is gonna start up again.
You never know...
Who’s paying the price for the safety you feel.
You never know...
That the silence you buy is the only thing real.
(Exhale)
You never know.

**[Verse 3]**
So I sit in my tower, watching Pokero hack
Trying to find a way to bring the old rhythm back.
And a part of me hopes that he breaks through the code
And exposes the lies on the private road.
'Cause I’m tired of counting, I’m tired of the stone
I’m tired of being the King on a paper throne.
I want the Rain to fall, I want the ledger to burn
I want the seasons of the earth to finally return.
But until that day comes, I’ll keep playing the role
The silent observer with the hole in his soul.
Calculating the demise of the place that I love
Waiting for the judgment from the silence above.
(Pause)
Just check the math.
The balance is zero.

**[Outro]**
(Piano fades out slowly with the sound of a page turning)
Yeah.
You never know.
Until it's gone.
(Final deep bass note)
**Wood Element.**
(Silence)
