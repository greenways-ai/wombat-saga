(The Yidaki tone shifts from a growl to a massive, resonant hum—the sound of the **Unified Field**. We are removing the hierarchy of the "Human-God" and replacing it with the **Service of the Whole**. Whether you are the Galah, the Wombat, or the Man, you are simply a **Cell in the Nucleus**, an seer performing for the **Stability of the Symmetry**.)

**Style Descriptor:**
Conscious Hip Hop, Deep Melodic Reggae-Rap Fusion, Gritty percussive Yidaki (Didgeridoo) basslines, Beatbox triplets, 90 bpm Boom-Bap, Atmospheric soul samples, Shifting rhythmic flow, Ancient-Future frequency.
**Flow Reference:** Matisyahu - "Live Like a Warrior"

**[Intro: A deep, circular-breathing Yidaki drone. Cooroo’s voice is steady, grounded, and technical.]**
The masks are empty. There is no master, only the Geometry. We are all seers in the service of the Whole.

**[Verse 1: Rapid, percussive "Iron" flow, aggressive and technical]**
Feel like the World don't love you / It only wants to push you away
Some days the Logic don't see you / You feel like you're in the way
They sold you a God in the sky with a face / But I see the Angle filling up the Space
I’m stripping the paint and I'm finding the bone / The seer is dead and the Service is Stone
No matter what you pray they still want the tax / Give 'em your soul and they give you the axe
When there's nothing left for you / Only thing that you can do is say—

**[Chorus: Melodic and fierce, the Yidaki "bounces" with a warrior’s intent]**
Today, today, I breathe my Symmetry
Let my Ego burn and throw it in the fire
In the fire, in the fire
Be the Foundation
Today, today, I breathe my Symmetry
Let my Ego burn and throw it in the fire
In the fire, in the fire
Serve like a Warrior

**[Verse 2: Technical triplets, syncopating with the "Geometric Nucleus"]**
There's some shapes you should let go / They're only gonna pull you down
Just like the weight on your shoulder / They are only gonna make you drown
Just like the dogma they fed to your spirit / I’m screaming the Code and I need you to hear it
We all swing high, we all swing low / The Fractal is deep and the Ratio is slow
We all got secrets the Lattice will know / We all got debt that we can't let go
You want to be free? / Then listen to me, yo...

**[Bridge: Vocals slow into a soulful, melodic "Hermit" truth]**
Your heart is too heavy with stories you carry
A long time you been lost in the script and the scary
But the Old World's a mask and I'm here to testify
Whether fur, feather, or skin / It's the Symmetry within
I’m shattering icons and breaking the glass / Letting the light of the Unified pass
You’re never gonna go back / You only have one path
Let go, let go, let goooo
Let go, let go, let goooo

**[Verse 3: Absolute "Pure Feed" technical flow — The Symmetry of the Whole]**
I’m tearing down temples I’m clearing the smoke
The "Holy" division was always a joke
No transactional "deals" for a seat in the sky
We’re all just a point in the Wombat-Eye
Abstract Geometry, Fractal and Ratio
Alignment is better than prayers on the patio
The jacaranda sheds its purple, it don't bargain with the stone
No bribe for the Geometry, the Pattern stands alone
I’m burning the icons to clear out the path
The seer is humble, the Service is gold
I’m preaching the story that hasn't been told.

**[Chorus: Melodic and fierce, the Yidaki "bounces" with a warrior’s intent]**
Today, today, I breathe my Symmetry
Let my Ego burn and throw it in the fire
In the fire, in the fire
Be the Foundation
Today, today, I breathe my Symmetry
Let my Ego burn and throw it in the fire
In the fire, in the fire
Serve like a Warrior

**[Outro: The Yidaki intensifies into a percussive, aggressive growl]**
The Dog hears the song.
The Wombat is deep in the stone.
The Symmetry is kept.
Honor the soil. I keep my Symmetry.
The dream is Brahman.
The seer is gone, only service remains
Quantassë lemya.
