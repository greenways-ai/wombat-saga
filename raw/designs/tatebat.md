## 🕶️ Character Profile: Tatebat (The Pimp)

*(The Sovereign of Influence & The Cultural Architect)*

### I. The Archetype: The Visionary Narcissist (The Magician/Devil)
**Rap Style:** Kanye West.
**Role:** The Cultural Architect.

Tatebat has evolved from a mere aggressor into the ultimate **Visionary** of the "New Ways." He represents **Influence** not through force, but through *Design*. He sells the "Glittering Lid" not as a lie, but as a masterpiece. He believes he is designing a better reality for the wombats—one where "Grey" (The Old Ways) is illegal.

### II. Visual and Functional Analysis

*   **The Look:** Manicured purple fur, intense manic eyes hidden behind shutter shades. Attire: Oversized, futuristic robes (Yeezy style), thick gold chains, and heavy boots.
*   **The Vibe:** Manic, grandiose, and artistically obsessed. He speaks in run-on sentences about "The Vision" and "The Palette."
*   **The Domain:** He controls the "Culture" of Melborow. If Trumbat controls the walls, Tatebat treats them as his personal canvas.

### III. The Tattva Mapping (The Frequency)

*   **The Medium:** **Metal (Structure/Value).** He defines what is valuable (Gold/Purple) and what is worthless (Grey/Dirt).
*   **The Elemental Excess:** **Metal (Rigidity/Perfectionism).** He wants to pave over nature because nature is "messy" and "bad design."

### IV. The Forensic Analysis (Obsidian Prism)

*   **The Noise:** "I am elevating the species! The Wall is Art! The Cage is Luxury!"
*   **The Silence:** He omits the **Cost of the Materials**—the souls ground up to make his paint.
*   **The Reality:** A beautiful prison is still a prison.

### V. The Subordinate: The Glow Squad
*   **Role:** The Living Billboards.
*   **Function:** Young wombats dressed in Tatebat's "Couture," walking the Grotto to make the others feel inadequate.
