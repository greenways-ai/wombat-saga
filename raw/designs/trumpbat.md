## ⛪ Character Profile: Trumbat (The Priest)

*(The Sovereign of Infrastructure & The High Pontiff of Safety)*

### I. The Archetype: The Golden Protector (The Hierophant)
**Rap Style:** Mellow Gospel / Smooth R&B.
**Role:** The Priest.

Trumbat represents **Infrastructure** as religious dogma. He preaches the "Golden Gospel of Safety Grout." He believes that the only way to survive the Tall-Ones is to build walls so thick—and so beautiful—that reality cannot penetrate them.

### II. Visual and Functional Analysis

*   **The Look:** Radiant white fur that seems to glow under the temple lights. Eyes are deep purple and often half-closed in a mellow expression. Dressed in silky ceremonial robes made of woven gold thread and cream-colored linen. He wears a majestic golden mitre.
*   **The Vibe:** Silky, mellow, and hypnotic. He speaks with a smooth, soothing cadence that makes the most terrifying laws sound like a lullaby.
*   **The Domain:** He controls the "Church" and the "State." He defines what is "Safe" and what is "Heretical" with a whisper rather than a shout.

### III. The Tattva Mapping (The Frequency)

*   **The Medium:** **Pentacles (Stability/Tradition).** He sells the illusion of permanence through opulence.
*   **The Elemental Excess:** **Earth (Stagnation).** He wants to freeze the world in a beautiful, golden moment to prevent the "Earthquakes" (Human activity).

### IV. The Forensic Analysis (Obsidian Prism)

*   **The Noise:** "Peace. Stability. The Golden Wall is your sanctuary."
*   **The Silence:** He omits the **Temporal Crop**—the wall is not protecting them; it is a gilded cage designed to keep them docile during the harvest.
*   **The Reality:** The Gilded Tomb is still a tomb.

### V. The Subordinate: Rumbat (The Foreman)
*   **Role:** The Hand of the Priest.
*   **Function:** Rumbat is the physical manifestation of Trumbat's will. Massive, silent, and loyal, he oversees the pouring of the Melborow's Finest. He does not ask why the wall is built; he simply ensures it stands, hidden behind Trumbat's golden curtains.

### 📜 Sample Verse (Smooth Mellow Flow)
