# Visualization Prompt: The Heart-Topology of Arnam

**Objective:** Visualise the "Inverted World" of Arnamland using a toroidal/cardioid flow simulation.
**Key Concept:** The world is the *inner* lining of a heart-shaped sphere, illuminating from a central star point, flowing downwards to a recycling node.

---

## 1. The Core Geometry (The Container)
*   **Base Shape:** A **3D Cardioid** (Heart Shape) or a pinched Torus.
*   **The Shell:** The boundary is not solid rock, but a semi-transparent, crystalline **Diamond/Glass** mesh.
    *   *Texture:* Voronoi fracture pattern (Hexagonal).
    *   *Opacity:* High at the bottom (dense), fading to transparent ghost-glass at the outer edges.
*   **Orientation:** The "cleft" of the heart is at the top (North/Entry), and the "point" is at the bottom (South/Exit).

## 2. The Light Vector (The Flow)
*   **Source (The Nico Star):** A blindingly bright, gold/white point-light emitting from the absolute center of the top cleft (The Entry Node).
*   **Direction:** The light does *not* radiate gently in all directions. It is a **Vector Beam** pouring straight down the central axis (The Aorta) towards the bottom point.
*   **The Great Wattle:** At the very top entry point, surround the light source with a "crown" of golden particle emitters (simulating the Wattle pollen/dust).

## 3. The Landscape (The Inner Skin)
*   **Inversion:** The terrain is mapped to the *inside* of the Cardioid shell.
*   **The Horizon:** From any point on the surface, the terrain curves *upwards* into the sky, creating a "bowl" effect.
*   **Vegetation Vector:** Trees and structures should not point "up" (relative to the viewer) but should point **inward** toward the Central Light Source.
    *   *Effect:* Trees at the top of the heart look like they are hanging upside down.
*   **The City (Melborow):** A grey, flat, artificial "scab" or ring located at the mid-latitude of the heart. It interrupts the smooth organic curve with jagged, cubic blocks.

## 4. Particle Systems (The Physics)
*   **System A: The Golden Dust (Arnam)**
    *   *Origin:* Top/Center (Nico Star).
    *   *Flow:* Spiraling downwards along the magnetic field lines (Spiral 1-7).
    *   *Color:* Gold/Amber.
    *   *Behavior:* Fluid, non-turbulent flow.

*   **System B: The Grey Static (Melborow Smog)**
    *   *Origin:* The mid-latitude City Ring.
    *   *Flow:* Stagnant, horizontal layers trying to form a flat ceiling.
    *   *Color:* Dull Grey/Charcoal.
    *   *Behavior:* Jagged, erratic vibration (High Noise).

*   **System C: The Violet Weave (Compassion)**
    *   *Origin:* The "Space Between" the Shell and the Terrain.
    *   *Flow:* Pulsing glowing veins connecting the roots.
    *   *Color:* Deep Ultraviolet/Lilac.

## 5. Animation/Forces
*   **The Pulse:** The entire Heart-Shell should expand and contract rhythmically (The Beat).
*   **The Cycle:**
    1.  **Ignition:** Light blasts from the top.
    2.  **Flow:** Gold dust travels down the curves.
    3.  **Compression:** Matter collects at the bottom "Closing Node."
    4.  **Recycle:** A faint return current travels up the *outside* of the shell to feed the Star again.

## 6. Color Palette (Hex Codes)
*   **Nico Star:** `#FFFFFF` (Pure White) -> `#FFD700` (Gold)
*   **The Glass Shell:** `#E0F7FA` (Cyan Tint) -> `#1A237E` (Deep Blue Void)
*   **The Bad Grounds (Melborow):** `#424242` (Grey Static) -> `#212121` (Grout)
*   **The Morning Glory/Compassion:** `#7C4DFF` (Deep Violet) -> `#E040FB` (Neon Lilac)

**Summary for Prompt:**
"A 3D cross-section of a heart-shaped hollow world. The landscape is on the inside shell. A central pillar of golden light pours from the top cleft to the bottom point. The outer shell is crystalline glass. Trees grow inward toward the center. A grey industrial ring encircles the middle, creating a flat layer of smog amidst the golden flow."
