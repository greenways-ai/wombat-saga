## 🔫 Character Profile: Vitabat (The Grand Treasurer)

*(The Sovereign of Investment & The Keeper of the Tally)*

### I. The Archetype: The Imperial Collector (Justice / The Tower)
**Rap Style:** T.I.
**Role:** The Imperial Collector (Board of Revenue).

Vitabat has absorbed the aggression of the original Tatebat persona. He represents **Investment** in its most brutal form: *The Collection*. He manages the **Tally-Debt cycles** of Arnamland with an iron fist. He ensures that every **Advance** is repaid, either in currency or in "muscle memory."

### II. Visual and Functional Analysis

*   **The Look:** Sharp, tailored white suit made of reinforced Kevlar-weave root fiber. He is scarred, imposing, and has a heavy metal robotic arm on his left side. He moves with the precise lethality of a street king.
*   **The Vibe:** Cool, calculated menace. He doesn't yell; he whispers the terms of your foreclosure.
*   **The Domain:** He controls the **Imperial Granary** and the **Tally**. If you owe the Council, you owe Vitabat.

### III. The Tattva Mapping (The Frequency)

*   **The Medium:** **Swords (Violence/Logic).** He uses technology as a weapon against chaos.
*   **The Elemental Excess:** **Water (Freezing/Hardening).** He freezes assets and hardens hearts. He turns the flow of resources into a weapon.

### IV. The Forensic Analysis (Obsidian Prism)

*   **The Noise:** "It's just business. Respect the contract. Pay what you owe."
*   **The Silence:** He omits the **Data Black Hole**—the interest rates are rigged so that payment is impossible.
*   **The Reality:** The **Tally-Debt** is a fiction designed to justify his violence.
