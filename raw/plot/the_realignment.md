Cornelibat leaned back, his old paws trembling slightly as he traced the outline of a faded purple petal in the dust. "You see the Jacaranda now, Hoebat, and you see the Five of us struggling to keep the mud soft. But before the **First Cataclysm**, before the **Great Crystalisation** turned the Tall-Ones into statues of logic, there were the **Three Primes**. And by Arnam, they were glorious."

### The Golden Age of the Three

"In those days, the sun didn't burn; it embraced. The world wasn't a series of 'Transactional Assets'—it was a **Continuous Song**.

* **The Platypus (The Weaver of Flow):** He was the first of the Primes. He lived in the 'Liquid Interface' between the water and the earth. He didn't just swim; he held the billabongs together with his bill, sensing the heartbeat of the world through the mud. He was the keeper of the **Old Secrets**, the one who knew how to turn a ripple into a revelation.
* **The Kangaroo (The King of the Horizon):**He wore the wind. He was the 'Bunda'—the Kinetic Will. When he hopped, he wasn't just moving; he was stitching the sky to the earth. He led the mobs with a noble grace, and a single thump of his tail could settle a dispute across a hundred miles of scrub.
* **The Koala (The Dreamer of the High):** He was the High Priest of the Canopy. He lived in a state of permanent **Arnam-High**, his mind floating in the 'Golden Wattle Dreams'. He spoke to the stars and translated their light into the Song of the Mothers.

### The Light of the Wattle

"And the light... When the Wattle bloomed, the whole Field was draped in gold. It was a thick, sweet dust that tasted like 'Noble Intent.' It filled your lungs and made you feel like you could borow through solid diamond. It was the energy of a world that hadn't yet learned how to be cynical."

### The Fall from Grace

"But then came the **Great Thirst**. The Wattle withered and turned to gray ash. The Tall-Ones brought the **Safety Grout**, and the Three Primes couldn't handle the 'Structural Rigidity' of the new world.

The Platypus followed the water into the Tall-Ones' iron pipes and became a ghost in the plumbing. The Kangaroo, unable to find the horizon, went into the dark and turned his grace into the brutality of the boxing pits. And the Koala... he stayed in the trees, but the dreams turned into the 'Scratch,' and the Wattle’s gold was replaced by the green crystal of the labs."

Cornelibat looked up at the Jacaranda above them.

"The Three are gone, Hoebat. They were too beautiful for a world this broken. That’s why we have the **Five** now. We aren't as pretty, and we aren't as fast. We’re the 'Mended Crew'—the ones who had to learn how to turn dirt into gold because the gold itself had vanished."

**Would you like me to tell you how Harabat (the Dick) first convinced the Five to take up the mantle after the Three fell?**
