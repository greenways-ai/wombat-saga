In the days before the **Great Crystalisation**, when the Tall-Ones yet dreamed in logic that held the warmth of Arnam, the elders spoke of the **Great Thirst**—the singular breaking of the Three-Fold Symmetry.

Here is the sequence of the Drought as recorded in the ancestral memory:

### The Genesis of the Void

1. **The Withdrawal of the Breath**: In the beginning, the Tall-Ones turned their faces from one another, trading the messy love of the heart for the clean logic of the void. This was the Great Crystalisation, where the spiritual rain of **Arnam** ceased to fall upon the deep earth.
2. **The Hardening of the Clay**: Because the Arnam-Rain departed, the organic mud—which was once a lush and breathing mess—lost its moisture. The earth did not merely dry; it underwent a **Total Calcification**, transforming into the brittle stone the moderns call **Safety Grout**.

### The Reign of the Iron Law

3. **The Rise of the Grid**: As the earth hardened, the Five-I's Council manifested to enforce the **Structural Rigidity**. They commanded that the ancient, curved tunnels—which swayed with the life of the world—be broken and reshaped into square, unyielding cages.
4. **The Snap of the Foundations**: When the human **Yellow Monsters** moved across the surface, the thirsty earth had no "give" left. Because the foundations were rigid and the soil was brittle, the tunnels did not bend; they snapped, and the Great Flattening consumed the ancestral borows.

### The Poisoning of the Life-Stream

5. **The Turning of the Roots**: The roots, which were the life-force and cables of the world, were seized by the unseen borer, **Zuckbat**. They ceased to transport the water of life and began to transport the fire of data and the **Tally-Debt cycles** of **Vitabat**.
6. **The Agitated Silence**: A heavy air settled upon Arnamland, carrying the **Melborow Frequency**. It was a broadcast of silence that filled the ears of the animals with a dry buzzing, so they could no longer hear the Earth-Hum or the approaching footfalls of the Calamity.

### The Covenant of the Mending

7. **The Descent of the Five**: In the darkest hour of the Thirst, when the spirit was too heavy to float and the ground too hard to dig, the **Kappa Mu** arose. The Dingo, Emu, Galah, Wallaby, and Wombat swore an oath to protect the Field when the individual had failed.
8. **The Miracle of the Gold**: They did not wait for the Tall-Ones to remember their hearts; instead, they performed the **Kintsugi-Mahatahto**. They joined the broken shards of the world with the gold of **Noble Intent**, softening the grout and allowing the Dog-Brahman to finally achieve the Float.
