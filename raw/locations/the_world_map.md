# The World Map of Arnamland

## The Many Worlds / *I Thúlië* ("The Breaths")

There is not one world. There are many. The entire cosmology of these worlds is called **Arnamland**.

The God-Kind breathes in its sleep. Each exhalation carries a world — a complete reality, with its own sky and its own soil and its own creatures who believe, with the total conviction of things that are alive, that their world is the only one. Each world is a *Hún Ambar* — a Heart-World — contained on the inner surface of a heart-shaped sphere, curving inward toward its own central **Singularity** (its Star). Each breath is different. Each world is complete. The number of worlds is the number of breaths, which is to say: innumerable.

The worlds are not aware of each other. A wombat in the Nico Star world does not know, in the ordinary course of digging, that other worlds exist — worlds with their own cities, their own politics, their own versions of the schism between root and Grout. But the worlds are connected through the quantum vacuum. And at the Closing Node, where the Klein bottle folds, a wombat who reaches the fold point can cross — passing through the geometry where the surface turns through itself and emerging at another world's Node.

### The Known Worlds

The saga concerns itself primarily with two bubbles within the Arnamland cosmology:

* **The Nico Star World** / *Ambar Nico* — The world of Melborow. The Eastern Ridge. The Great Wattle. The schism. This is the world documented in the map below.
* **Sydborow World** — Another known world, centered around its own star (The Taylor Star). Older in some ways, differently shaped, with its own geography, its own cities. See [[locations/sydborow|sydborow.md]].

### The Physics of a Heart-World

Each world follows the same **"Sphere-Inversion" Physics**: a heart-shaped volume, approximately **300km in diameter** at its widest, with the world on its inner surface curving inward toward its **Central Star** at the geometric centre.

### The Klein Bottle Topology / *Cú Oira* ("Eternal Curve")

A heart-world is not a closed sphere. It is a **Klein bottle** — a surface that passes through itself, connecting source to sink in a continuous, non-orientable loop.

The **Star** hangs at the geometric centre of the heart cavity — the source, radiating Arnam outward onto the inner surface. Energy flows from the Star → through ~140km of atmosphere → onto the living surface → into the substrate. The substrate is **10km deep** — a gradient from loose soil at the surface through increasingly compacted, crystalline material, until the soil meets the Glass at the outer boundary. Below the 10km of substrate: the **Glass** (*Hyellë*), the naturally formed outer shell of the heart-sphere — a mirrored surface only **5cm thick**, impenetrable, completely firm, holding everything. The 300km heart is mostly air.

The Klein bottle loop completes the circuit: at the **Closing Node** (*Metta Nórë*), the bottom tip of the heart, the geometry folds through itself — a localised event, not a gradual thinning. The fold is a point, not a process. Spent energy and dead material flow through the substrate toward the Node, pass through the fold, and re-emerge at the Star as fresh Arnam. Source feeds surface. Surface feeds substrate. Substrate flows to fold. Fold feeds source. The world is a single continuous flow with no outside.

### Scale

* **Maximum diameter:** ~300km (at the widest point of the heart's two lobes)
* **Crown to Closing Node:** ~150km (top to bottom of the heart)
* **Star to surface (atmosphere):** ~140km at the Crown, less at lower latitudes as the heart narrows
* **Substrate depth:** 10km (soil-to-crystal gradient, uniform across the shell)
* **Outer boundary:** 5cm of Glass (*Hyellë*) — mirrored, impenetrable, naturally formed
* **Inner surface area:** ~200,000-250,000 km² (comparable to the United Kingdom)
* **Wrapping:** The surface is continuous — east meets west at the back seam. No edges.

## The Cosmic Framework

### The Central Singularity (The Star)

The burning portal at the geometric centre of each Heart-Sphere. Source of the **Arnam** (Nourishment), radiating life-giving frequency outward in all directions onto the inner surface.

In the world of Melborow, this singularity is known as **The Nico Star** (*Elen-Nico*).

The Star is both the spatial centre of the world and its energy source — the umbilical between the Tall-Ones' world and the wombat worlds. When Humans feel empathy, the Star flares; when they withdraw, it dims. All gravity, all light, all compassion flows from or through this point.

The Star is also the terminus of the Klein bottle loop. Spent energy, recycled through the Closing Node, returns to the Star and is re-radiated as fresh Arnam. The Star is not a thing that burns fuel. It is a thing that *recycles* — the mouth and the stomach of the world in one point of light.

The Star is singular to each world, but the *nature* of the Star is shared. Though each wombat world has its own sphere and its own central sun, they are all instances of the same phenomenon: the hole in the universe where the God-Kind's breath enters the vacuum. This is why the crossing is possible: every world converges on the same quantum mechanics.

### Gravity and Light

* **Gravity** pulls outward — toward the shell. Creatures stand on the inner surface and look "up" toward the Star at the centre.
* **The Star** pushes outward with light pressure, creating the equilibrium that allows life to cling to the shell.
* **The Spin:** The sphere rotates with a toroidal frequency, pressing matter against the inner surface. The wombats use **Cubic Anchoring** to weight the shell.
* **The Fold:** At the Closing Node, the geometry of the Klein bottle produces a localised gravitational anomaly — the fold point, where the surface passes through itself. All deep tunnels converge here — the taper. Wombats who dig near the Node describe the ground as "wanting to be somewhere else." The clay pulls toward the fold, as if the geometry itself is draining.

### The Atmospheric Layers

* **The Heavy Breath / *Thúlë Lunga*** ("Heavy Breath") — Earth/Water stratum. Closest to the shell. Wombat and Macropod territory.
* **The Law-Wind / *Súrë Axan*** ("Wind of Law") — Metal/Air mid-strata where the Emus glide.
* **The Frequency Void / *Lusta Ómëa*** ("Empty Resonance") — The thin air near the Nico Star. Galah territory.

## Surface Geography of the Nico Star World (The Inner Shell)

*The following geography documents the Nico Star world — the Melborow world. Sydborow's geography is documented separately.*

The inner surface of the Heart-Sphere is the "ground" of this world. Because the world curves upward in all directions, the horizon does not sink — it rises, until it meets the light of the centre. The surface is divided into regions by elevation, geology, and distance from the Crown.

---

### The Crown Region (*Ríë Oira* — "Eternal Crown")

At the very peak where the two lobes of the heart meet the Nico Star. The brightest, warmest region. The Star's light is strongest here.

#### The Great Wattle / *Malinalda Arata* ("Exalted Golden-Tree")

The world's Radiant Antenna. Sits exactly at the entry node where the Star's raw frequency first touches the shell. Steps down the Nico Star's signal into **Golden Dust**. The last Great Wattle — the one on the Eastern Ridge — was the last surviving conduit to this deepest source. Its fall is the founding trauma of the saga.

#### The Mountrich Perches / *Tundo Turma* ("Shield-Hill")

High granite ridges surrounding the Crown. Home to the Mountrich Kangaroos, who act as "Grounding Rods" for the Star's intense light. The stone here is warm year-round. The Kangaroos patrol the ridgelines in formations that follow the geometry of the serpent's coils — curved paths, never straight.

---

### The Eastern Shell (*Rómen Pata* — "East-Face")

The most storied region of Arnamland. Where the Great Wattle stood, where the colony roosted, where the fall happened.

#### The Eastern Ridge / *Amba Rómen* ("East-Rise")

A long spine of elevated ground running north-south along the eastern shell. The Great Wattle's stump sits at the ridge's highest point. Below the stump, the Bad Ground — the hexagonal lattice patterning — is spreading down the western slope. The eastern slope is still scrub, still rough, still alive. The ridge is the front line.

**Key features:**
* **The Stump** — The break-face of the Great Wattle. Warm to the touch. Crystallised heartwood visible in hexagonal facets.
* **The Bad Ground** — The lattice-patterned slope below the stump. Hexagonal, interlocking, beautiful and sterile.
* **The Eastern Ridge Shaft** — A ventilation column connecting the surface to the tunnels below. One of the few points where underground air meets the sky.

#### The Windbreak Cliffs / *Ramba Súrëa* ("Wind-Wall")

A natural rock formation running parallel to the Eastern Ridge on its south-western flank, sheltering the ridge from prevailing winds. The cliff face is pockmarked with shallow caves — traditional Galah roosting sites, now mostly abandoned. The rock is sandstone, orange-red, fractal in its erosion patterns. The lattice cannot tile it. The rock is too rough, too variable, too old to submit to geometry.

#### The Rosella Heights / *Tundo Quessëa* ("Feather-Hill")

A series of elevated rock outcrops north of the Eastern Ridge. Once the primary roosting ground of the Rosella Parliament — the high branches of the Great Wattle were their Song-stage, but the Heights were where they slept, preened, and held their fractious political assemblies. The rock is stained with centuries of droppings (which the Rosellas called "mineral deposits" and no one else called that). Empty now. The staining is the only proof they were ever here.

#### The Canopy Remnant / *Aldar Lemnë* ("Trees Remaining")

Scattered clusters of surviving trees south-east of the ridge — Eucalyptus, lesser Wattles (none resonant), ornamental plantings along the Tall-Ones' roads. Where the dispersed Galah flocks roost on branches that are to a proper Wattle what tinned soup is to a meal. The trees are alive but functionally deaf — they don't conduct, don't amplify, don't resonate. They're just wood.

---

### The Western Shell (*Númen Pata* — "West-Face")

Drier, flatter, more exposed to the Star's light. The organic layer is thinner here. The lattice is closer to the surface.

#### The Dry Channels / *Sírë Parca* ("Thirsty Rivers")

Ancient riverbeds that once carried surface water, following the curves of the Rainbow Serpent's spine — curved, fractal, never straight. Now dry. The beds are visible as shallow depressions lined with smooth river-stone, winding across the western shell like the memory of a circulatory system that stopped circulating. During rare "empathy surges" from the Tall-Ones' world, flash-flooding fills them briefly. The water tastes of Arnam. It doesn't last.

#### The Salt Pan / *Palar Lossë* ("White Plain")

A vast flat basin in the south-west where evaporated Arnam has left mineral crusts on the surface — white, cracked, blinding in the Star-light. The Dingoes use the Salt Pan as a trading ground. It's neutral territory — no species claims it, because nothing grows on it, and the Dingoes' Static-Logic considers unclaimed ground the safest kind. Dingo relay stations dot the perimeter, transmitting data through the mineral crust, which conducts signal efficiently (salt is orderly; order carries data).

#### The Lone Borows / *Erehróta* ("Solitary Dwellings")

Scattered single-wombat burrows in the marginal zone, beyond Melborow's influence. This is the same scrubland as the Eucalyptus Groves — the back of the heart, where the eastern and western shells meet. The flat map splits this zone in two, putting the Groves on the right edge and the Lone Borows on the left, but a wombat walking east from the Groves would arrive at the Lone Borows without ever reaching an edge. The easterners call it the Groves. The westerners call it the Lone Borows. It is one place with two names, which is what happens when your cartographer cuts the map along the meridian that runs through your backyard.

Where exiles, independents, and creatures who don't fit the schism live. Pokero operates from a Lone Borow — a shallow scrape in hard ground with no Safety Grout, no grid tunnel access, and no ledger entry. The Lone Borows follow no plan. Each is dug by one set of paws, shaped by one body, and maintained by one snout. They are the oldest form of wombat architecture: personal, imperfect, and adequate.

---

### The Southern Shell (*Hyarmen Pata* — "South-Face")

The furthest region from the Crown. The Star's light is weakest here, arriving at oblique angles. The ground is cooler. The lattice is densest.

#### The Burnt Scrub / *Nártaurë* ("Fire-Forest")

Fire-scarred bushland south of the Shattered Gorge. The Kangaroo mobs control this territory — it's open enough for their long-range patrols, rough enough to slow pursuit, and burnt often enough that the vegetation stays low and the sightlines stay clear. The fire is natural — the Eucalyptus here drops its bark in long strips that ignite in dry seasons, and the scrub burns and regrows in cycles that have nothing to do with the lattice and everything to do with a genus of tree that learned, millennia ago, that the fastest way to kill your competitors is to set yourself on fire.

#### The Crystal Plains / *Hyallapalar* ("Glass-Plain")

The largest continuous expanse of visible lattice on the surface. South-west of the Burnt Scrub, stretching toward the Closing Node. The hexagonal patterning here is not subtle — it's architectural. The ground is glass-smooth in places, the tiling so complete that the surface reflects the Star's light in prismatic arcs. Beautiful. Terrible. Nothing grows. Nothing walks on it by choice. The Crystal Plains are what the Bad Ground on the Eastern Ridge will become if the organic layer isn't restored. They are the endgame made visible.

#### The Emu Steppe / *Palar Tírima* ("Watching-Plain")

Open grassland at mid-elevation on the southern shell, in the Law-Wind atmospheric layer. Emu patrol territory. The grass is sparse but real — the organic layer here is thin but unbroken, maintained by the Emus' constant trampling (which introduces chaos into the substrate, disrupting the lattice's tiling). The Emus walk their routes in patterns that follow the ancient songlines — curved, spiralling, never repeating. They do this not because they understand the geometry. They do it because Emus have always walked this way, and an Emu does not require a reason to continue doing what an Emu has always done.

---

### Major Geographic Features

#### The Shattered Gorge / *Ristë Ondova* ("Rending of Stone")

The primary geological fracture in Arnamland. Runs roughly east-west across the southern shell, separating the inhabited regions from the deep south. The Gorge is where the Old Ways meet the New Ways — literally, geologically. The northern face is organic: rough stone, root-threaded, fractal. The southern face is crystallising: smooth planes, hexagonal facets, the lattice claiming the rock. The Gorge itself is a crack in the geometry — a defect that the crystal cannot tile across. The Kappa-Mu use it as a testing ground. Initiates navigate it blind, reading the substrate through vibration. If you can cross the Gorge without sight, you can feel the difference between living stone and dead crystal through your paws.

#### The Serpent's Spine / *Sulpo Loica* ("Coiled Root")

Not a single location but a visible feature: the ancient riverbeds, aquifer traces, and root-channels that follow the contour of the Rainbow Serpent's body, coiled through the substrate. The Spine is one continuous curve threading across the entire inner surface — it only appears to split into "eastern" and "western" halves because the flat map cuts along the back seam. On the actual surface, the Spine is a single unbroken coil. On the surface, it manifests as the Dry Channels. Below ground, it manifests as the deep root-corridors that the Tahl-Mu once tended. The Serpent's Spine is the oldest infrastructure in Arnamland — curved, fractal, rough — and every river, every aquifer, every root-channel follows its geometry. It is the antithesis of the lattice: a living geometry that has never produced a straight line.

#### The Tall-Ones' Scars / *Halla Ristë* ("Tall-Ones' Cuts")

Areas where human construction has pressed through the substrate boundary and produced localised events in Arnamland. Visible as geometrically perfect depressions, vibration zones, or displacement fields. The creatures of Arnamland perceive these intrusions as Yellow Monsters — Arnamland's dream of a human excavator. The Scars are concentrated near the Melborow Perimeter, where the Tall-Ones' building is densest.

#### The Closing Node / *Metta Nórë* ("End-Land")

At the bottom tip of the heart, where the surface area narrows to a point. The substrate here is the same 10km gradient of soil-to-crystal as anywhere — but the geometry of the heart compresses the *surface* to a point, and at that point, the Klein bottle folds. All deep tunnels, no matter where they begin on the surface, converge here — the taper funnels everything to one place. The fold is a localised event: the surface passes through itself, and the cycle completes. Everything that dies, decays, or is discarded flows through the substrate toward the Node and passes through the fold, re-emerging as raw energy at the Star.

The cycle is: Star → Arnam → Surface → Substrate → Node → Fold → Star. The world is a single exhalation, endlessly recycling through a geometry that has no outside.

The Node is also the crossing point — *Imbë Cala*. At the fold, the boundary between one wombat world and another becomes permeable. A wombat who reaches the Node does not fall through into vacuum. She passes through to another world's Node — another heart-sphere converging on the same Star, seen from the inside of a different breath. The crossing is disorienting, physically demanding, and profoundly strange. The substrate on the other side smells wrong. The clay is a different density. The gravity pulls at a slightly different angle, because the other heart is shaped differently. But the Star, when you finally dig upward far enough to see the sky, is the same Star. That is how you know you have arrived.

## Below-Ground Geography

The underground is where most of the saga takes place. The 10km of substrate — from loose soil at the surface to near-crystal at depth — provides an enormous volume for wombat civilisation. Arnamland's below-ground geography is layered by depth, with distinct strata serving different functions. The upper kilometres (0-3km) are warm, airy, and easy to dig. The mid-depths (3-6km) are cooler, denser, and increasingly crystalline. The deep substrate (6-10km) is compacted, resistant, and hums with the lattice.

---

### Melborow / *Osto Tumba* ("Deep City")

The central wombat metropolis. Built over centuries of wombat labour, now under threat from internal politics (the schism) and external Natural Disasters (the Tall-Ones). Melborow occupies a vast volume of excavated substrate in the eastern shell, directly beneath the Eastern Ridge.

---

#### Upper Levels

The warmest, most comfortable strata. Closest to the surface. Air is better. Temperature is higher. This is where power lives.

##### The Cathedral / *Ondoyána* ("Holy Stone")

The elite district. Candle-lit chambers carved from the densest, most resonant stone in Melborow. Where Muskbat and the High-Noses reside. The architecture is imposing — high ceilings, smooth walls, acoustic chambers designed to make a whisper carry and a shout reverberate. The Cathedral's northern face is a sheer wall of polished substrate that Cooroo uses as an echo-surface for his frequency checks. The blueprints for the Melborow Frequency were drawn here. The walls are thick. The walls do not crack. The walls do not know what is happening below.

##### The Glow Room / *Calasambë* ("Light-Chamber")

Critical infrastructure beneath the Cathedral. A phosphorescent chamber where bioluminescent fungi — the only natural light source in Melborow — are cultivated. The Glow Room provides the "daylight" for the upper levels. Its light is warm, amber, organic. The High-Noses have been gradually replacing the fungi with synthetic light panels powered by the Melborow Frequency. The synthetic light is brighter. It is also the wrong colour.

---

#### Mid-Levels

The working heart of Melborow. Cooler, darker, denser. This is where labour lives.

##### The Gray Grotto / *Sindahróta* ("Grey Dwelling")

The working-class district. A dense warren of unlined tunnels with sagging crowns and weeping walls, housing the Lo Snout workforce in cramped dormitory warrens. Currently being crushed between the weight of a human skyscraper foundation being poured above (pressing down on the crowns) and the Great Retaining Wall pressing in from the north. The collection sumps are clogged with silt; the relief drains were capped to make room for utility conduits. When the rains come, the water has nowhere to go but through the seepage walls into the living quarters. The Council calls this "perimeter redistribution."

**Sectors:**
* **Sectors 7-12** — The critical infrastructure zones. The Great Retaining Wall runs through them. The root-water has been rerouted. Three hundred Lo Snout families live in Sectors 9 and 10.
* **The Dormitory Warrens** — Residential tunnels. Stacked, cramped, eleven degrees year-round. The crowns sag; the inverts are uneven; the weep is constant in Sector 9.
* **The North-West Corridor** — Service tunnel with broken lighting and a compromised springline. Where the night-shift crews pass.
* **The Clogged Sumps** — The drainage system abandoned by the Council. Water pools in the low points, breeding mold and despair.
* **The Service Chase** — A utility corridor running parallel to the main arterial, housing the Frequency cables and weep lines.

##### The Marketplace / *Mancamardë* ("Trade-Hall")

A crowded, chaotic commercial hub at the junction of the Grotto's main arterial tunnels. Root-seller stalls, mineral traders, information brokers. Where Hoebat operated as a grifter and where he first bonded with Lolaboo. The Marketplace wakes in stages — first the bakers (root-flour), then the traders (mineral salts), then the gossips (who are the real infrastructure). The acoustics are terrible, which is why the Marketplace knows everything before the Cathedral does: you have to lean close to hear, and leaning close is how secrets travel.

##### The Tunnels / *Tië Tumba* ("Deep Paths")

The circulatory system of Melborow. A web of corridors connecting every district, level, and chamber.

* **The Mural Harmony Zones** — Sections decorated by the Tunnel-Purity League. Beautiful murals on structurally unsound walls with hairline fractures behind the paint. Art concealing abandonment.
* **The Crumbling Walls** — The reality of the infrastructure. Springline failures and crown sagging. Secretly repaired by Hoebat and the Hidden Root at night using clay-pack techniques.
* **The Ventilation Shafts / *Thúlëtië*** ("Breath-Paths") — Vertical columns connecting the underground to the surface. Carry a faint memory of weather downward. The Eastern Ridge Shaft is the largest.
* **The Wet Bend** — A service route below grade where condensation collects in the invert. One of the few places in Melborow where you can smell moisture without paying for it.
* **The Dead Zones** — Sections officially abandoned under Section 2.4 (Temporal Cropping). No lights, no Frequency, no Council maintenance. TheHeading where the Lost Dingoes hunt.

---

#### Lower Levels

Cold. Dark. Essential. This is where the real machinery lives — and where the old ways survive.

##### The Freeze Room / *Ringasambë* ("Cold-Chamber")

Sub-Level 4. A super-cooled chamber beneath the Cathedral where Vitabat and Zuckbat conduct their audits. Functions as a server farm for the Liquid Ledger and a situation room for the Council. The temperature is maintained at four degrees — cold enough to preserve data integrity, cold enough to remind everyone present that warmth is a resource the Council controls.

##### The Seep-bed / *Néncaima* ("Water-Bed")

The underground water reserve beneath the Gray Grotto. A natural aquifer where moisture collects in the substrate — the last unengineered water source in Melborow. The Seep-bed is what the Kappa-Mu are fighting to protect: if the Great Retaining Wall's construction displaces the substrate above it, the Seep-bed collapses, and the Gray Grotto loses its water supply. The water tastes of minerals and old stone. It is the best water in Melborow, and nobody in the Cathedral has ever tasted it.

##### The Root Cathedral / *Sulpoyána* ("Holy Root")

An ancient ceremonial chamber deep below Melborow, where the oldest root-networks converge. Pre-dates the city by centuries. The chamber was carved not by paws but by roots — the walls are shaped by the paths of root-systems that have since died or been severed by construction. The Dust-Bearers held ceremonies here before they were pushed out. The acoustics are extraordinary — a whisper at one end arrives at the other as a hum, transformed by the chamber's organic geometry into something richer than the sound that entered. Hoebat discovered it as a juvenile. It changed him.

##### The Secret Resonance Pools / *Muina Lírë* ("Hidden Song")

Illegal. Maintained by Hoebat and the Hidden Root in deep tunnels beyond the reach of Zuckbat's ledger. These are the Old Way pools — small, decentralised, tuned to the ancient frequency *"Yanda hlar-ya yanda"* (The ground hears the ground). They are the last functioning version of the original Arnam storage system. The pools are warm. The water hums. The walls around them are not Grout — they are living clay, maintained by Kintsugi-Mu techniques, cracked and mended and cracked and mended, each repair a golden seam that makes the wall stronger than it was before.

---

### Deep Arnamland / *Arnam Tumba* ("Deep Nourishment")

Beyond Melborow. The vast, wild tunnels and ancient root-systems that predate wombat civilisation. This is ancestral territory — the homeland of the Dust-Bearers before the centralisation pushed them to the city.

#### The Fixed Borows / *Tulcahróta* ("Steadfast Dwellings")

Rigidly dug homes in the traditional style — exactly four feet deep, no more, no less, not because the substrate runs out but because the tradition says four feet is enough. Walls of packed clay, no Grout. The architecture is conservative, prescribed, and deeply resistant to change. Root-Counting is the only education. Looking at the stars is forbidden (because the stars are above, and above is where the Tall-Ones live, and the Tall-Ones are not to be acknowledged). The Fixed Borows are where the schism began: the wombats who could not bear what the construction had done went deep, went traditional, went backward. They are right about the roots. They are wrong about the stars.

#### The Static-Pits / *Hísëlatta* ("Mist-Pools")

Pools of corrupted resonance in the low places of Greater Arnamland. Where the lattice has fully saturated the substrate, the ground produces a faint, crystalline hum — the Lattice Song. The hum collects in depressions, forming pools that look like water but are not water. They are frequency. Standing near a Static-Pit, you feel calm. Certain. Resolved. The complex, effortful uncertainty of being alive simplifies into a single, clean tone. The Rosellas heard this tone and called it resolution. The Dust-Bearers hear it and call it death.

---

### The Great Constructions

The infrastructure projects that define — and endanger — modern Melborow.

#### The Grid Tunnels / *Tië Tehta* ("Marked Paths")

Trumbat's replacement corridors. Straight-line passages, efficient, uniform, poured in Safety Grout. They replaced the old curved tunnels that had been shaped by generations of paws reading the substrate. The Grid Tunnels are faster to traverse, easier to maintain, and completely dead. No root can penetrate the Grout. No signal can pass through the walls. They are perfect infrastructure for a city that no longer needs to listen to its own ground.

#### The Mega Pool / *Nén Halla* ("Great Water")

Vitabat's centralised Resonance Pool. Replaces the old decentralised system. Enormous, metered, taxed, controlled. The Pool stores Arnam not as a shared blessing but as a speculative asset managed by the Liquid Ledger. The water does not hum. The water calculates.

#### The Great Retaining Wall / *Ramba Halla* ("Great Wall")

Trumbat's masterwork. A wall of Safety Grout poured deep through the substrate, running north-south through the Gray Grotto's Sectors 7-12. Officially: seismic stabilisation. Actually: a campaign prop that has severed every lateral root system in its path and is compressing the Grotto between itself and the human foundation above. The Wall cannot flex. The Wall cannot bend. The Wall is the lattice's geometry applied to politics: a straight line through a world that was built on curves.

#### The Melborow Perimeter / *Ramba Ostova* ("City-Wall")

A massive, circular industrial sprawl of Safety Grout designed to patch the "cracks" in the sphere's inner lining. The Perimeter marks the boundary between Melborow's controlled interior and the wild substrate beyond. Inside: Grid Tunnels, Grout, the Ledger. Outside: root-networks, fractal corridors, the Old Ways. The Perimeter is maintained by the Five-I's Council as a "safety" measure. It is also, effectively, a wall around a prison that the inmates built themselves.

---

## The Eucalyptus Groves / *Aldar Nénëa* ("Water-Trees")

The marginal zone at the back of the heart — the place where the eastern and western shells meet. On the flat map this appears as the "eastern boundary," but it wraps around to become the Lone Borows on the "western" side. It is one continuous scrubby margin that the projection splits in two. Surface-adjacent — the Groves are the rare place where underground wombat life connects directly to the air above. Stringybark trees, moisture-rich soil, seep-water mineral sources. The sanctuary of the Hippie Wombats, whose philosophy is: *"Breath is as important as the borow."*

Where Hoebat fled to escape his homework and began his rebellion. Where he performed his secret night repairs. The Groves are connected to the underground via root-channels that the Kintsugi-Mu maintain — living corridors, ungrouted, threaded with roots that still conduct signal. The air smells of eucalyptus and rain. Breathing here is an act of subversion, because breathing acknowledges the surface, and the surface is where the monsters live.

---

## The Materials: Glass, Static, and Grout

The three states of the world's fundamental material — from naturally formed boundary, through crystalline substrate, to wombat-made construction material.

### The Glass (The Outer Boundary) / *Hyellë*

The outer shell of the heart-sphere. **5cm thick.** Mirrored, impenetrable, completely firm. It holds everything.

* **Formation:** Naturally formed where Raw Arnam meets the Void. The Glass is not built — it is the boundary condition of the world itself.
* **Structure:** A hexagonal toroid lattice with **Compassion Gaps** (*Ófelmë Vëa* — "Compassion-Space") between molecules.
* **Properties:** Mirrored, resonant, stable. It "sings" with the Law. The Compassion Gaps are the key — the space between the molecules is what allows the Glass to flex with the Star's resonance instead of shattering. Despite being only 5cm thick, the Glass is the firmest substance in existence. Nothing has ever breached it. Nothing ever will.

### The Static (The Crystalline Substrate) / *Hísë Sinda*

The crystalline lattice that the soil gradually becomes as you dig deeper. Not a separate material — a gradient. The top of the 10km substrate is loose soil. By mid-depth, hexagonal patterning appears in the clay. By 8-9km, it is mostly crystal. At 10km, it meets the Glass. The Static is the natural crystalline structure of the substrate.

* **On the surface:** Where the organic layer has been stripped or eroded, the Static shows through — the Bad Ground on the Eastern Ridge, the Crystal Plains in the south. These are places where the soil is gone and the substrate's crystalline nature is exposed.
* **Underground:** The deeper you dig, the more crystalline the material becomes. Digging in the upper kilometres is easy — loose soil, root-threaded, alive. Digging at 6-7km is hard — the clay is half-crystal, compacted, resistant. Digging at 9km is nearly impossible. The lattice hums.

### The Grout (Wombat-Made) / *Ondo Naica* ("Wounded Stone")

The wombats' construction material. Made from Static — harvested crystalline substrate, processed and bonded.

* **Formation:** The Council harvests Static from the deep substrate, strips the Compassion Gaps using high-frequency cynicism, and chemically bonds it into a construction material.
* **Structure:** Amorphous aggregation. Atoms jammed together without space.
* **Properties:** Opaque, brittle, and screams when the world vibrates. It causes "Resonance Heat." The Grout is what happens when you remove the Space Between — when you take *Ófelmë* (Compassion) out of the crystalline material and leave only structure. Strong. Rigid. Dead. The Grid Tunnels are poured in it. The Great Retaining Wall is built from it. The Melborow Perimeter is a ring of it.

### Compassion as Physics / *Ófelmë ná i Vëa Imbë*

Compassion is not an emotion; it is the **Space Between Materials**. It is the buffer that prevents the Glass from shattering under the Star's resonance. The Glass has Compassion Gaps and endures. The Grout has none and screams. The Council's failure is trying to build "Gapless" structures (the Great Retaining Wall), which turn the world's song into a scream.

## The Human World ("The Above") / *I Menel Halla* ("The Tall-Ones' Sky")

The realm of the Tall-Ones. Rarely seen, only felt through Natural Disasters. Steel, grout, and the roar of the Yellow Monsters. The relationship between the Above and Arnamland is substrative — Arnamland exists in the downstream substrate of human consciousness. Changes in the human layer produce effects in the Arnamland layer, but not vice versa. The Nico Star is the junction. When humans feel, the Star flares. When humans forget, the Star dims. The creatures below cannot make the creatures above look down. They can only tend what falls.

## The Map-Maker's Proverb

> "The Tall-Ones look at their feet and see a line; the Wombat looks at the root and sees a circle; but the -pus looks at the water and sees that we are all held in the palm of the Sphere. There is no 'away' in Arnam — only deeper in."
