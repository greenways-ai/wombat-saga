# The Flattened Map of Arnamland

## The Problem

You cannot flatten a Klein bottle. You cannot flatten a heart. You certainly cannot flatten a heart-shaped Klein bottle whose inner surface is where everyone lives and whose bottom point folds through itself into another world.

Wombat cartographers have been trying for centuries. Every projection is a lie. The question is which lie is most useful.

## The Heart Projection / *Hún Tehta* ("Heart-Mark")

The standard wombat map. The one that appears on Zuckbat's wall, in the Five-I's Council briefing room, and in every schoolborow in Melborow. It is drawn in the shape of the world itself: a heart, with the Crown at the top and the Closing Node at the bottom point.

### How It Works

Imagine cutting the heart-sphere along a single meridian — a line running from Crown to Node along the *back* of the heart — and peeling the inner surface outward, pressing it flat. The result is a heart-shaped sheet with the Crown region at the top, the Closing Node at the bottom tip, the Eastern Shell on the right, and the Western Shell on the left. The left and right edges of this sheet are the same place — the back seam where the cut was made. A creature walking off the right edge of the map would appear at the left edge. The Council centres their cut on the far side of Melborow, making the city look central. The Dust-Bearers centre theirs elsewhere.

The Nico Star is marked at the geometric centre of the heart — a point that exists *above* the flattened surface, in the cavity the creatures look up into. On the flat map, the Star is drawn as a symbol at the centre, floating over the geography like a watermark. It is the one feature of the map that is not on the surface and cannot be walked to.

### What It Shows

Reading the Heart Projection from top to bottom:

**The Crown Region** (top of the heart, where the two lobes meet)
- The Crown of Origin / *Ríë Oira* — dead centre at the top
- The site of the Great Wattle / *Malinalda Arata* — marked with the tree-glyph, now struck through
- The Mountrich Perches / *Tundo Turma* — granite ridges flanking the Crown on both sides, curving outward along the upper edges of each lobe

**The Upper Lobes** (the two rounded bulges of the heart — the widest part of the world, ~300km across)

*Right Lobe — The Eastern Shell / Rómen Pata:*
- The Eastern Ridge / *Amba Rómen* — a north-south spine of elevated ground in the upper-right quadrant, roughly 30-40km from the Crown. The stump is marked. The Bad Grounds is shaded in hexagonal hatching below the ridge, spreading downslope.
- The Windbreak Cliffs / *Ramba Súrëa* — drawn as a jagged line parallel to the ridge on its south-western side
- The Rosella Heights / *Tundo Quessëa* — a cluster of elevation marks north of the ridge, in the upper curve of the right lobe
- The Canopy Remnant / *Aldar Lemnë* — scattered tree symbols south-east of the ridge, trailing toward the mid-latitudes
- The Eucalyptus Groves / *Aldar Nénëa* — marked at the right edge of the right lobe, where the projection cuts. This is the back seam — it wraps around to become the Lone Borows on the left edge. One place, split by the map

*Left Lobe — The Western Shell / Númen Pata:*
- The Dry Channels / *Sírë Parca* — drawn as dotted curved lines winding across the left lobe, following the Serpent's Spine. The curves are conspicuous on a map dominated by straight grid-lines and hexagonal hatching
- The Salt Pan / *Palar Lossë* — a large white oval in the lower-left quadrant. Dingo relay stations are marked as small triangles around its perimeter
- The Lone Borows / *Erehróta* — scattered single dots at the left edge of the left lobe. This is the same marginal scrubland as the Eucalyptus Groves on the right edge — the back of the heart, split in two by the projection. The easterners call it the Groves. The westerners call it the Lone Borows. Unlabelled on the Council's version of the map. Labelled on Pokero's.

**The Mid-Latitudes** (where the two lobes narrow toward the waist of the heart — the world is ~200km across here)

- The Serpent's Spine / *Sulpo Loica* — the ancient watercourse contours are visible as faint curves appearing in both lobes, but this is one continuous coil split by the projection. On the actual surface, the Spine is a single unbroken curve threading across the entire inner shell. On traditional Dust-Bearer maps, the Spine is the primary feature and everything else is secondary. On the Council's map, it is not drawn at all.
- The Tall-Ones' Scars / *Halla Ristë* — marked as geometric depressions, concentrated near the Melborow Perimeter

**The Shattered Gorge** (running roughly east-west across the waist of the heart, where the lobes narrow into the lower body — the world is ~150km across here)
- The Gorge / *Ristë Ondova* — drawn as a heavy dark line cutting across the full width of the map. The northern face is shaded organic (rough, irregular). The southern face is shaded crystalline (smooth, geometric). The Gorge is the most prominent surface feature on any projection — a crack that runs from edge to edge, dividing the living north from the crystallising south.

**The Southern Shell** (below the Gorge, the heart narrows toward the point — the world compresses from ~150km down to nothing)

- The Burnt Scrub / *Nártaurë* — stippled shading in the upper-south, right of centre. Fire-scar patterns. Kangaroo mob territory markers (which the Council's cartographers do not recognise and the Kangaroos do not care about)
- The Emu Steppe / *Palar Tírima* — open grassland shading, mid-south, with curved dotted lines showing Emu patrol routes that spiral and never repeat
- The Crystal Plains / *Hyallapalar* — hexagonal hatching filling most of the lower-south, growing denser as the map narrows. The hatching here is not the sparse patterning of the Bad Grounds on the Eastern Ridge. It is solid. Architectural. The map itself becomes geometric as you approach the Node.

**The Closing Node** (the bottom point of the heart — the taper, the fold, the crossing)
- *Metta Nórë* — drawn as the sharp point at the bottom of the heart. On the Council's map, it is labelled "Waste Processing" and given a small administrative glyph. On Dust-Bearer maps, it is labelled with an ancient symbol that means both "end" and "mouth." On no map is it labelled accurately, because no flat map can show what actually happens here: the surface folds through itself, the substrate thins to nothing, and the world becomes another world.

### What It Distorts

The Heart Projection has three fundamental distortions:

**1. The edges are a lie.** The left and right edges of the heart are the same place — the back seam where the projection cut the surface. Locations at the right edge (the Eucalyptus Groves) are directly adjacent to locations at the left edge (the Lone Borows). They are one continuous marginal zone, split in two by the cartographer's knife. The Serpent's Spine, which appears in "both lobes," is one continuous coil. The Dry Channels and the Canopy Remnant may border each other at the back. The projection creates an artificial east-west division that does not exist on the actual surface.

**2. The Klein bottle fold cannot be shown.** The bottom point of the heart is drawn as an endpoint — the map stops. But the world does not stop. The Closing Node folds through itself and re-emerges at the Star. The flat map cannot depict this. It is like trying to draw the back of your own head while looking in a mirror. The fold is real. The map pretends it isn't. Every wombat who has used the Heart Projection to navigate toward the Closing Node has arrived at the point and discovered that the map ends where the world doesn't.

**3. The Star is not on the surface.** The Nico Star, marked at the centre of the map, is ~140km "above" the surface at the Crown, further at lower latitudes. It appears on the map as though it is a surface feature you could walk to. You cannot. You would need to fly straight up for ~140km through increasingly thin atmosphere. Only the Galahs get close, and even they cannot reach it. The Star on the map is a theological assertion, not a geographic one.

## The Underground Cross-Section / *Tehta Tumba* ("Deep-Mark")

Wombat maps traditionally include a cross-section: a vertical slice through the world from Crown to Node, showing the substrate depth and the underground geography.

### Reading the Cross-Section (Crown to Node)

```
CROWN ─────────────────────────────────── NICO STAR (centre)
  │                                            ●
  │ ← ~140km atmosphere →                     │
  │                                            │
  ████████████████████████████████████  ← Surface (inner shell)
  ████  MELBOROW  ████████████████████     0-3km: loose soil, root-networks
  ████  [Cathedral]  █████████████████     3-6km: compacting, crystalline

  ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒  ← soil-to-crystal gradient
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  ← Glass (5cm mirrored boundary)

                  ▼ FURTHER SOUTH ▼
        (heart narrows — less surface area,
         same 10km substrate depth)

  ██████████████████████████████  ← Surface (narrower here)
  ████  GORGE REGION  ██████████     10km substrate (same depth)

       ▼ ALL DEEP TUNNELS CONVERGE ▼
        (the taper — every tunnel from
         every direction leads here)

          ██████████████  ← Surface (narrow)
          ██████████████     10km substrate
          ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒  ← gradient
          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  ← Glass (5cm)
               │
               ▼ FOLD ─────────────────► back to STAR
           (Imbë Cala)           (Klein bottle loop)
```

The cross-section shows how the heart's geometry works: the *surface area* narrows as you move south, but the *substrate depth* remains 10km throughout — a gradient from loose soil at the surface through increasingly compacted, crystalline material, until it meets the 5cm Glass boundary at the outer edge.

The critical feature of the underground is the **taper**: all deep tunnels, no matter where they begin on the surface, converge toward a single point at the bottom tip of the heart. The geometry funnels everything to the Closing Node.

This is where Melborow sits: in the northern substrate, with room to build cathedrals and grottoes and retaining walls and all the infrastructure of a species that expresses its anxiety through architecture. The same 10km depth is available everywhere — the Fixed Borows of Deep Arnamland are exactly four feet deep not because the substrate runs out, but because tradition says four feet is enough.

At the Node, the surface narrows to the fold point. And then — depending on who you ask — either waste processing (Council version), the recycling loop back to the Star (physicist version), or the mouth that swallows and speaks (Dust-Bearer version).

## The Council's Map vs. The Dust-Bearer's Map

The same world. Two different projections. Two different lies.

### The Council's Map

Drawn on Safety Grout tablets. Clean lines. The Grid Tunnels are the primary feature — straight, labelled, colour-coded by function. The Melborow Perimeter is drawn as a thick circle with "SAFE" on the inside and nothing labelled on the outside. The Serpent's Spine is not shown. The Lone Borows are not shown. The Closing Node is labelled "Waste Processing" in small administrative text. The Nico Star is drawn as the Council's own emblem.

The Council's map is accurate about infrastructure. It is accurate about nothing else.

### The Dust-Bearer's Map

Drawn on clay. Stamped, not written — the geography encoded in rhythmic impressions that can be read by paw. The Serpent's Spine is the primary feature: every river, every root-channel, every aquifer contour, drawn in curves that follow the Serpent's body. The Grid Tunnels are not shown (the Dust-Bearers consider them an affliction, not a feature). The Closing Node is drawn as a spiral — a mouth that feeds itself. The Nico Star is drawn as a tear falling upward.

The Dust-Bearer's map is accurate about the ground. It is accurate about nothing above it.

### What Neither Map Shows

The Morning Glory. The vine growing in the crack. The colour of concentrated sky. The signal pointing south-east toward a tree with a violet bloom.

Neither faction's cartography has a symbol for "something new growing in the wreckage." Both factions' cartography assumes the map is finished.

The map is not finished.

## A Note on Projection and Truth

Every flat map of a Klein bottle heart-sphere is a compromise. The Heart Projection preserves shape but splits the back seam, turning one continuous surface into a sheet with edges that don't exist. The Cross-Section preserves depth but loses the surface. The Council's map preserves control. The Dust-Bearer's map preserves memory. None of them can show the fold. None of them can show the wrapping. None of them can show the Star as it really is — not a symbol on a surface but a point of light at the centre of everything, equidistant from all places, belonging to all worlds, burning with whatever the Tall-Ones feel and giving it, indiscriminately, to whatever is alive enough to receive it.

The truest map of a wombat world would be the world itself: curved, heart-shaped, folded, continuous, with no edges and no outside. But you cannot carry the world in your paw. So you carry a lie that is shaped like the truth, and you navigate by the parts that are accurate, and you remember — if you are wise, if you are a Galah, if your feathers are working — that the map stops where the world doesn't.
