# The Five Borow Societies of Melborow

*"One City, Five Pits, Ten Million Shovels."*
— Melborow Tourism Slogan (struck through with graffiti that reads: **ONE PIT. FIVE LIDS. YOU'RE THE SHOVEL.)*

---

Melborow is not a city in the way the surface creatures understand cities — as an accumulation of structures built outward from a common center, spreading horizontally until they meet the edge of what the builders were willing to fund. Melborow is a city built *inward*. Downward. Each district descending from the last, each Borow pressed deeper into the substrate as though the city is trying to get away from itself. The result is a place where altitude is social destiny: the higher your burrow, the higher your Credit; the deeper you live, the closer you are to the truth that the city runs on your body.

The **Five Borows** are not equal. They were never designed to be. They are five chambers in a single machine, and the machine produces one thing: the comfortable belief that the machine is necessary.

## I. Melborow Central (The Core)

*"The Cathedral doesn't need you to believe. It only needs you to stay inside."*

### The Landscape

Melborow Central is the only district where the tunnels are beautiful.

This is worth pausing on, because it is the point: the beauty is the control. Trumbat understood, long before any of the other Sovereigns worked it out, that a population marveling at its own cage is a population that will defend the cage against anyone who offers to open it. The Cathedral tunnels are hewn to perfect square cross-section — flat crown, flat invert, ninety-degree corners that catch the Glow-Panel light and throw it back in planes of cold gold. The walls are cast in **Melborow's Finest**: the highest-grade Safety Grout, pumped with mineral pigment to run a warm cream color that the approved literature describes as *"Ivory of the Eternal Foundation."* What the literature does not describe is the sound. In the Cathedral tunnels, the walls are so perfectly sealed that sound behaves differently — voices bounce rather than absorb, giving every conversation an unnatural resonance, an echo that arrives a fraction of a second behind the words. Every creature in Melborow Central sounds, faintly, like they are two of themselves.

The **Cathedral of the Frequency** dominates the highest tier of the district. It is not a single structure but a vertical stack of resonance chambers, each one tuned to a different harmonic of the Melborow Frequency, each one lined with crystalline Grout panels that vibrate at the Council's preferred signal. To stand in the Cathedral's central chamber is to feel the Frequency not as background noise but as a physical presence — a hum that enters through the chest cavity and sets every bone softly resonating. Lo Snouts who are brought to the Cathedral for administrative proceedings report feeling, for several hours afterward, a profound sense of peace. This is not an accident. The feeling does not indicate that anything is well.

Above the Cathedral, in the upper tiers, live the **High-Nose elite** in **Vertical Borows** — apartments stacked miles deep into the substrate, each floor a statement of increasing status, each ceiling a floor for the creature with a slightly better Credit rating. The very highest chambers are reserved for the Consecrated Class: former Wombaram officials, retired Magistrates, creatures whose Tally-Stones have been notched with so many *Assets* that the stone itself has been retired into the Cathedral vaults and replaced with a fresh slab. They live in filtered air. The raw Frequency — which, at ground level, carries the metabolic waste of a million terrified wombats — has been scrubbed and re-broadcast at the upper levels as something cleaner. Something closer to what they remember the Arnam feeling like. It isn't. But memory is a flexible thing, and comfort is a powerful solvent.

### The Social Architecture

**Trumbat** rules Melborow Central as a High Priest rules a faith: not through force, but through the management of meaning. He is the one who decides what *Safety* means. He is the one whose smooth, honey-register voice describes the Great Retaining Wall as *"a monument to the species' will to endure"* rather than what it actually is: a project funded by the Corvée bodies of every Lo Snout who fell behind on their Tally-Debt.

The dominant class in the Core are the **Wombaram** — the priestly administrative order that Trumbat has inherited, reformed, and perfected. They wear ceremonial robes of woven gold thread and carry the twin instruments of authority: the **Resonance Bell** (tuned to disrupt Old Way frequencies) and the **Notching Stilus** (obsidian-tipped, used to carve Tally-Debt into the split-stones that represent a wombat's future). Their power is legitimate by design: every institution that could challenge it — the Wombiki, the Dust-Bearer guilds, the Well-Field councils — has been either absorbed, discredited, or poured into a foundation wall.

Below the Wombaram sit the **Fixed Borow officials** — the local magistrates who administrate the individual residential tiers, who settle disputes and collect the Tribute and skim a small percentage of filtered Frequency for their personal meditation chambers. They are middle management of the sacred. They believe in the system the way a brick believes in the wall it belongs to: completely, without the capacity to imagine anything else.

At the base of the Core, where the Cathedral's foundations press deepest into the substrate, live the **Consecration Workers** — Lo Snouts assigned to the maintenance of the Cathedral itself. They clean the Glow-Panels. They replace the Frequency cables. They clear the condensation that forms in the resonance chambers and that carries, if you look closely, a faint violet tint that Trumbat's maintenance reports consistently describe as *"mineral residue from standard Grout offgassing."*

It is not mineral residue. Anyone who has spent time near the Shattered Gorge knows what faint violet in condensation means. The Cathedral is being slowly colonized by something the Grout cannot seal against.

Nobody in the Core looks closely.

### The Wrong Note

The Cathedral's south wall has been replastered eleven times in the last four seasons. Each time, within three weeks, a crack reappears in the same location — a single hairline fracture running diagonally from floor to ceiling, following no structural logic, violating every load-calculation the Board of Works has commissioned. The official explanation changes with each repouring: *subsidence*, *thermal expansion*, *resonance fatigue*. What the Glow-Panel light reveals, if you stand at a particular angle in the hour before the Frequency dims, is that the crack traces the outline of a dancing figure. Legs planted. Arms raised. Mid-spiral.

Trumbat has commissioned a new mural for that section of wall. The mural depicts the **Five Sovereigns in Harmonious Contemplation**. It is very large. It covers the crack exactly.

---

## II. Queensborow (The Sprawl)

*"The only thing worse than not having status in Queensborow is having it."*

### The Landscape

Queensborow smells of cheap Lyptus-perfume and expensive ambition, and the two scents combine into something that coats the back of the throat and makes clear thought feel like work.

It is the most densely populated Borow — a chaotic, multi-layered maze of residential tunnels dug at such different angles and depths and by so many different generations of diggers that the official map of Queensborow is acknowledged even by the Council to be aspirational rather than accurate. The tunnels here are older than the Grid, older than the Safety Grout Geometry, dug by the original Grotto families who came down from the surface before the Tally existed and who shaped their homes the way wombats always shaped their homes: by feel, by instinct, by the particular pressure of a paw against clay that says *here, not there, this curve, not that angle*. These old tunnels are the bones of Queensborow, and the modern infrastructure has been built on and around and through them with the casual indifference of a city that has decided its history is in the way.

**Tatebat** has tried for two decades to Glow-Panel the entire Borow. He has succeeded in the middle and upper tiers, where the **Social Mining rigs** — data-harvest installations, disguised as public art — pulse bioluminescent blue from every junction point, reading the micro-expressions and heartrate variations of every creature who passes. In these lit zones, the tunnels are papered with **the Billboards**: enormous printed images of the ideal Queensborow wombat — purple-highlighted fur, posture of serene confidence, a Tally-Stone visible at the hip not as an instrument of debt but as an **accessory**. The wombat on the billboard has never touched clay. The wombat on the billboard has never been underground a day in its perfect life.

Below the billboards, the old tunnels still run dark.

### The Social Architecture

Queensborow's dominant economy is **Social Equity**: the trading of status, visibility, and perceived connection for the material goods that would otherwise require Credit. It is the Borow where a wombat who can't afford a Advance can sometimes survive anyway — if they are sufficiently seen, sufficiently admired, sufficiently able to project the appearance of a creature whose Tally-Stone carries no debt.

**Tatebat** is the architect of this system and its primary beneficiary. He does not govern Queensborow so much as he *curates* it. His edicts are not laws but **aesthetic rulings**: this season's approved fur treatment is amber-tipped; the previous season's brown-tipped is now a signal of low status; the grey of the Dust-Bearer palate is illegal under **Cultural Dissonance Code 7.4** (amended to include natural substrate pigment as "Subversive Nostalgia"). His subordinates — the **Glow Squad**, young wombats dressed in Tatebat's oversized Couture and deployed through the Borow as living advertisements — enforce these rulings not with Penalties but with the more efficient mechanism of social devastation. A creature caught in last season's fur treatment does not get fined. They get *looked at*.

The **Pre-Dug market** is Queensborow's commercial heart: a vast secondary market in tunnel-space, where existing burrows are bought, sold, subdivided, and repackaged as lifestyle products. A burrow in Queensborow is not described by its cubic footage or structural integrity. It is described by its *narrative*: *"a heritage void with character"* (a crumbling Old Way tunnel with a weeping wall), *"an emerging micro-district"* (a section of tunnel adjacent to a clogged sump that will be abandoned in three seasons), *"culturally resonant substrate"* (dirt that smells faintly of the Arnam that used to run through it before the Mega-Pool consolidation).

The Lo Snouts of Queensborow are the **Mirror Workers**: creatures employed to staff the Glow-Rooms, tend the Social Mining rigs, carry Tatebat's parcels between levels, appear in the background of official imagery looking aspirationally average. They are paid in **Status Tokens** — non-Tally scrip that can be exchanged for Tatebat-approved consumer goods but cannot be applied to Tally-Debt. The distinction is crucial and deliberate. Status Tokens keep the Mirror Workers working for Tatebat without reducing their dependency on the Tally and therefore on Vitabat. Two Sovereigns. One Lo Snout. The geometry of extraction is elegant, if you are not the one being extracted.

### The Wrong Note

In the deepest levels of Queensborow, where the Old Way tunnels still run and the Glow-Panels haven't reached, there is a section of wall — perhaps twenty meters long, perhaps more — that is covered in portraits.

Not printed. Not projected. *Pressed*. Made by a paw loaded with clay dipped in something that holds colour the way old things hold colour: permanently, quietly, without needing to be told. Each portrait shows a wombat in a stance of work — packing a wall, pressing an ear to the earth, hands deep in substrate. Below each portrait, in script that predates the Tally's standard characters, a name. Most names can still be read. Some can't. The wall has been Grouted over at least four times. The portraits come back through each layer, the clay pigment migrating upward, the faces pressing through the sealant the way a face presses against glass.

Tatebat's Glow-Squad has standing orders to repaper this section with billboards on sight. The billboards never stay. The portraits always return.

---

## III. Brookborow (The Grotto)

*"Melborow's most exciting emerging district. Investment opportunities available. Structural stability: ongoing assessment."*
— Tatebat's Official Development Prospectus, Year 7

### The Landscape

The Gray Grotto smells of rust and something living that the rust hasn't reached yet.

This is Brookborow's particular quality — not the beauty of the Core or the spectacle of the Sprawl, but the specific atmosphere of a place that hasn't decided to stop being alive yet, despite the concerted efforts of the infrastructure around it. The working-class district where Hoebat was raised. Where the Lo Snout families who built Melborow in the first generation put down their clay tools and built their burrows and became, over time, the substrate on which the rest of the city was erected. Literally, in some cases: the lower-level residential tunnels of the Gray Grotto were surveyed after the fact for the Cathedral's foundation calculations, their structural properties entered into the load tables as *existing material*, their residents reclassified as *occupants of essential infrastructure* — a designation that sounds protective and prevents the Council from being obligated to maintain anything.

The Grotto's tunnels are unlined in the old sections, sagging-crowned in the middle, and exhibit what the maintenance reports call *"active seepage characteristics"* — which means that when the Bronxborow Mega-Pools overflow, which they do seasonally, the water finds the Grotto's walls the way water always finds its way: through the path of least resistance, which is the path the Council chose not to repair.

**Muskbat** has colonized the upper tiers of Brookborow with his tech infrastructure. The **Server Farms** — great stacked warrens of Frequency hardware that generate so much heat the tunnels above them run ten degrees warmer than the rest of the city — are installed behind the old industrial facades. The original industrial tunnels, dug by the founding families for root-storage and waterworks maintenance, now house the **Glow-Rooms**: data centers where Scribat's team runs the algorithmic infrastructure that keeps the Frequency calibrated, that monitors the seismic inputs from the Lo Snout labor zones, that generates the daily **Amendment Reports** that Vitabat uses to decide who gets a Ration-Advance and who gets a Corvée requisition.

Between the Server Farms, the **Hipster Diggers** have moved in: young Queensborow wombats priced out of the Sprawl's Social Equity market, attracted to the Grotto's *"authentic substrate texture"* and *"heritage industrial character."* They drink artisanal seep-water in Old Way-aesthetic tunnel bars, their fur treated to simulate the grey-brown of natural clay, their Tally-Stones loaded with just enough credit to make the aesthetic of poverty feel like a choice. Their presence has increased the Grotto's desirability index in the development models. It has not improved the drainage.

### The Social Architecture

Brookborow is the Borow of **technical debt**: the place where every system that powers the rest of the city is installed, maintained, and left to decay until it fails catastrophically. The Grotto's Lo Snouts are the maintenance class — not the Corvée laborers of the Wall, who work in the open under Rumbat's supervision, but the **Shadow Maintainers**: the creatures who fix the Frequency cables when they short, who clear the Server Farm ventilation before the heat becomes a fire, who pack the seepage walls between flood events without authorization or payment because if they don't, the flood comes through their own bedroom walls.

**Muskbat** rules Brookborow through the architecture of dependency. The Frequency infrastructure is his. The Glow-Panels are his. The real-time seismic monitoring that tells the Council where to dispatch the Corvée requisitions — his. He designed the Grotto's power grid so that it runs through a central relay node that he controls personally, which means that *Section 2.4 (Temporal Cropping)* — the rolling shutdown of non-essential services in low-Tally districts — can be executed from his Observatory with a single switch. The streetlights go dark. The heating panels cycle off. The Frequency dims to a frequency specifically tuned to increase mild disorientation. Residents are not told why. Residents are told, through the automated Womb-Alert system, that *"service interruption is due to essential infrastructure upgrade"* and that *"affected residents may apply for Emergency Ration-Advances through the standard Amendment process."*

The standard Amendment process takes six weeks and adds a notch.

The **Ghost-Diggers** are the Grotto's immune response: unlicensed repairers — exiles, expelled Academy students, Lo Snouts who reached the end of their Credit and went underground rather than reporting for Corvée — who perform unauthorized maintenance on the infrastructure the Council has decided to let decay. They work at night. They use scavenged materials. They fill seepage cracks with hand-packed clay. They clear drains with their bare paws. Nobody pays them. Nobody knows their names. When they are caught by Safety Inspectors, they are charged with *Unauthorized Structural Interference* and their repairs are Grouted over and their Tally-Stones — if they still have Tally-Stones — are notched for the Council's *remediation costs.*

The Council's remediation costs are consistently higher than the Ghost-Digger's original repair would have been.

### The Wrong Note

In the service corridor behind Server Farm 7 — the one that Scribat's maintenance maps don't include because it predates the Frequency infrastructure by sixty years and was accidentally paved over in the original installation — there is a junction where three old root-channels meet. They've been inactive for decades, the roots long dead, the channels dry as bone.

Except they aren't quite dry anymore.

In the last two seasons, something has been moving through those channels: a moisture, faintly violet-tinged, carrying a scent that the Lo Snout maintenance workers describe in their unofficial reports (the ones they keep on their own clay tablets, the ones that never reach the official maintenance log) as *"like a storm coming, but underground."* The Server Farm hardware in that section runs three degrees cooler than its operating specifications. The Frequency cables in the junction corridor have started producing a secondary harmonic. Not a malfunction. A response.

Scribat knows. He has been logging the anomaly for eight months. He has not told Muskbat. He isn't sure why. He only knows that the anomaly falls outside every predictive model he has, and that the last time he ran the dampening protocol to suppress it, the system bounced back harder, and he sat in the server room for a very long time afterward with the specific feeling of a creature who has just tried to tell a river to stop.

## IV. Bronxborow (The Hard Earth)

*"We don't have a slogan. If you need a slogan to know where you are, you're in the wrong Borow."*

### The Landscape

Bronxborow doesn't pretend.

This is its defining characteristic — not the rough sandstone tunnels, not the thick buttressed archways, not the deep-reinforced bunkers where the Tally servers run their calculations behind walls thick enough to survive the geological events the Council publicly insists will never occur. What defines the Bronx is the absence of the performance that the other Borows sustain. In the Core, everything is meaning. In the Sprawl, everything is appearance. In the Grotto, everything is the gap between the technology that claims to serve you and the infrastructure that actually does. In Bronxborow, everything is just what it is. The debt is debt. The enforcers are enforcers. The walls are walls — not monuments, not sanctuaries, not canvases. Just stone between you and the place where the stone has decided to stop.

The tunnels here are dug on the old principles: crowned arch at the springline, thick buttressing at the footings, geometry chosen for how it distributes load rather than how it photographs. A Bronxborow tunnel is the most structurally honest thing in Melborow. The arches flex under pressure rather than shattering. The walls are unskinned sandstone, rough enough to grip, porous enough to breathe, unpretty in a way that reveals what it is: substrate that has been shaped by work and holds its shape because the work was done correctly. Ghost-Diggers who have worked in all five Borows consistently report that Bronxborow's infrastructure is the most survivable in a flood. Nobody has investigated why.

**Vitabat** does not rule Bronxborow so much as he *owns* it — the way a creditor owns a building: not by living in it but by holding the instrument that can empty it overnight. The **Tally Vaults** are here, buried in the deepest bunkers, the split-stones of ten million wombats stored in climate-controlled rock faces whose precise location is known to Vitabat and to four officials of the Board of Revenue and to nobody else. The Council-Halves and Debt-Halves of every Tally in the city live in these vaults. Which means the future of every creature in Melborow lives in these vaults. Which means Bronxborow, whatever else it is, is the room where the city keeps its hostages.

### The Social Architecture

Bronxborow runs on a **meritocracy of honesty** — the only genuine meritocracy in the city, and the most brutal one, because what it rewards is not intelligence or creativity or status performance but the ability to see clearly and act on what you see.

The **Dingo Packs** are the dominant presence here. They have been since the Board of Revenue began using them as enforcement — first as debt-collectors, then as territorial monitors, then as the informal police force that the official Magistrates rely on to do the enforcement work that official records can't afford to show. The Dingoes of Bronxborow are not the Lost Dingoes of the Grotto's Dead Zones — those are the Pack-Broken, the desperate, the creatures whose covenant with the Pack structure collapsed and left nothing in its place but hunger. The Bronxborow Dingoes are **Pack-Intact**: organized, hierarchical, operating by the Dingo Code with all its brutal precision. They know the Tally-Stones by smell. They know which creatures are current on their debt and which aren't. They know the difference between a wombat who is late on a payment and a wombat who has decided to stop paying, and they treat these situations differently because the Code requires precision.

**Pokero** moves through Bronxborow as a specific kind of authority — not the Council's kind, not Vitabat's kind, but the kind that accrues to a creature who has seen the full architecture of a place and survived it with his understanding intact. He is the Pack's connective tissue with the other Borows, the creature who carries intelligence between the Westside and the rest of the city, who reads the Tally-Debt patterns for what they actually are (a map of which Lo Snout families the Council intends to Corvée in the next fiscal cycle) rather than what they claim to be (a record of voluntary obligation).

The **Wombat laborers** of Bronxborow have a different relationship with debt than those of the other Borows. In the Core, debt is spiritual — you owe it to the community, to the Star, to the principle of Harmonic Security. In the Sprawl, debt is aesthetic — it is managed as part of the status performance, hidden or displayed according to its social value. In Bronxborow, debt is simply physical. The notch on the stone means your body. Your body goes to the Wall. The Wall is Trum-Bat's project. The Wall requires your labor. This is the sentence, fully parsed, with no passive voice and no institutional euphemism to soften the grammar.

The Lo Snouts of Bronxborow have the highest rate of **Tally-flight** in the city — creatures who walk off their debt-assignment and go underground rather than report for Corvée. They have also the highest rate of recapture, because the Vault algorithms can locate a wombat's Debt-Half within a forty-meter radius if they stay in the city, and the Dingo enforcement network can close that radius to five meters given sufficient motivation.

The ones who disappear entirely — who exit the Tally system completely, who stop being findable by any algorithm — are the ones who go to the Ghost networks. Who learn the Old Ways. Who find Hangbat's kind of silence and carry it with them.

### The Wrong Note

The Tally Vault in the deepest bunker — Vault 7, the oldest, dug before the current cataloguing system, housing stones from the original Mutual Aid period when the Tally was still a gift-record — has a problem.

The stones in Vault 7 are singing.

Not audibly. The Magistrates who perform the quarterly inventory describe it as a vibration they feel in their paws when they lift the stones, a resonance that shouldn't be there in carved rock stored in a sealed chamber. The stones in Vault 7 are the oldest in the city — some of them predate the Debt-conversion, predate the Imperial Interest, predate the whole apparatus that turned the gift into the instrument. They still carry the original notation: *Here, surplus. Given freely. No return required.*

Vitabat has ordered the vault sealed pending investigation. The investigation has been pending for three years. Nobody has been sent inside since the last Magistrate came out with clay on his paws, sat down in the corridor, and wept for forty minutes without being able to say why.

---

## V. Statborow (The Reach)

*"If the Council visits your Borow, you have a problem. If the Council never visits your Borow, you are a problem they have chosen not to solve yet."*

### The Landscape

Statborow is reached by crossing the Shattered Gorge, which is the Narrows, which is the world's most geological metaphor: a rift in the substrate where the organic meets the crystalline and neither has won, where the northern face is rough and root-threaded and alive and the southern face is smooth geometry and finished silence, and between them is air and depth and the particular sound of something enormous in the process of deciding.

The crossing is made via the **Narrows Bridge** — a Council-built structure of Safety Grout and recycled Frequency cables that the High-Noses use infrequently and that every Lo Snout who has ever had business in Statborow has crossed with the particular alertness of a creature who knows that the bridge is maintained by the same Board of Works that maintains the Gray Grotto's relief drains. The Bridge is reinforced annually. The reinforcement is conducted by Corvée crews. The inspection reports are filed by officials who live in Queensborow and have never seen the Gorge. The Bridge holds. Probably.

Statborow itself is not a district that announces itself. After the density and noise and the Frequency's constant pressure in the other four Borows, Statborow feels like a room with the sound turned down. The tunnels are older here than anywhere else in the city — some dating to the Time Before, when the area was the edge of the Well-Field system's outer ring, when the nine-square grid still governed the land and the Common Squares still fed the Umbilicals and the Umbilicals still listened for what the Nico Star was saying. These pre-Tally tunnels are narrow, curved, shaped by paws that were following the grain of the substrate rather than the dictates of a load table. They smell of old water and something the Grotto wombats call *"deep time"* — the mineral scent of substrate that has never been Grouted, that has been breathing slowly for so long it has developed opinions about it.

**Zuckbat** rules Statborow without being present in it. He rules it the way the Tally rules every wombat: through the accumulation of observation, through the notation of discrepancy, through the quiet authority of a creature who knows exactly what you did on every day that you thought nobody was watching.

The **Archive** is here — the Council's formal memory, the storage facility for historical Tally records, decommissioned surveillance hardware, outdated policy documents, the official records of every Consecration ever performed. The Archive is Statborow's primary industry, its primary employer, and its primary reason to be periodically useful to the rest of the city. Archive workers are Statborow's only credentialed class. They carry special Credits that mark them as *Essential Records Infrastructure*, which means their Tally-Debt is deferred rather than collected — not forgiven, never forgiven, but deferred in the way that useful things are preserved while they are useful.

### The Social Architecture

Statborow has no dominant class in the usual sense. Its social structure is determined not by Credit or status-performance but by **proximity to the Closing Node** — the geological fold at the Borow's deepest point where the substrate curves back on itself, where the theories of Hangbat's **Loop Logic** are not theories at all but observable fact: you can stand at the Closing Node and feel the earth folding, feel the depth that isn't a floor but a return, feel the vertigo of a topology that was built for something other than the Cardinal Law of Down is Down.

Most of Statborow's population knows the Closing Node exists. Most of Statborow's population gives it a wide berth. The **Archivists** who work closest to the deep levels — the ones who descend into the lowest storage tiers for the quarterly inventory, who handle the oldest Tally-Stones — develop, over time, a specific quality of attention. They become very still. They listen more than they speak. They have the paw-sensitivity of Ghost-Diggers despite never having been outside the Archive. Something in the substrate down there teaches the body what the Academy's curriculum refused to.

Zuckbat surveils Statborow more heavily than he surveils any other district, which is notable given how little ostensibly happens here. The **Observation Posts** — small nodes of Frequency-monitoring hardware disguised as decorative Glow-Panel fittings — are installed in every tunnel junction, every Archive entrance, every crossing point of the old Well-Field tunnels. The surveillance feed runs directly to the data-scrolls. He monitors for **Dissonant Noise** — any deviation from the approved Frequency pattern, any resonance that matches the archived signatures of banned Well-Field songs, any vibration at the specific harmonic of the **Watcher's Frequency** that Hangbat stole from the Baram archives years before he was exiled.

The surveillance is why the Old Ways survive here. The High-Noses rarely come. The surveillance hardware is read by Zuckbat alone, and Zuckbat, for all his omniscience, has one consistent blind spot: he can see everything the Frequency records, and the Old Ways do not operate on the Frequency. They operate on Arnam, which is older than the infrastructure that monitors it, and which the Archive's deep-substrate tunnels still carry, faintly, the way a very old house carries the smell of everyone who ever lived in it.

**The Waste Processing Facility** — where the Grout-production cycle's chemical byproducts are filtered and the excess Static-ore is processed before it becomes too volatile for the upper-city operations — sits at Statborow's edge, beside the Gorge. Its workers are the lowest-Tally class in the city, creatures whose debt has been notched so deep that the algorithms have reclassified them from *Obligated* to *Permanent Asset*. They process waste that the production documentation acknowledges is hazardous and that the safety briefings describe as *"within acceptable exposure parameters."* The parameters were set by Vitabat. Vitabat set them by calculating the replacement cost of a Lo Snout worker against the cost of improved safety equipment. The parameters have not been revised.

### The Wrong Note

At the Closing Node, at the deepest point in Statborow, at the place where the substrate folds back on itself — there is a wall.

Not a Council wall. Not Grout, not structural reinforcement, not a foundation component of any archive or vault or transit tunnel. It is an old wall, made of packed clay and small stones, built in the Old Way: curved, narrow courses, hand-pressed, following the natural contour of the substrate around it. It is, by the structural assessment of any creature who examines it, unnecessary. The geological fold is stable. The wall serves no load-bearing purpose. It was built for something else.

It has been there longer than Melborow has had a name.

On the wall's surface — if you stand very close in the Glow-Panel's off-cycle, when the light drops to its dim setting and the Frequency follows it — you can see marks. Not the carved notches of a Tally-Stone. Not the angular glyphs of the official script. Curved marks. Flowing. The kind of marks a paw makes when it is recording a *feeling* rather than an *obligation*. The Archive's most senior Archivist — a wombat who has spent forty years in the deep levels and who is therefore very still and very quiet and not given to dramatic statements — has looked at these marks and said only this: they are not writing. They are not pictures. They are the impression of paws. Many paws. Pressing the same spots in the wall over many generations, as if touching something they needed to remember was there.

The Closing Node was not always a geological curiosity. It was a door. Nobody in the current city remembers what it opened to. But the wall remembers every paw that came to touch it. And sometimes, in the Frequency's dim hour, the marks pulse faintly violet.

Just once.

Then the Frequency rises again, and the light goes flat, and the Archive continues its work of recording what the city is willing to admit happened.

## Appendix: The Sump Line (Transit Between Worlds)

The five Borows are connected by the **Deep Sewer** — Council-bored tunnels running below grade, lined with Safety Grout, housing the **Sump Line** climate-controlled transit pods that the High-Noses ride between the Cathedral and Queensborow in sealed comfort, insulated from the substrate's vibration, ferried through the same geological layers that the Lo Snout maintenance crews enter on foot every shift.

The Sump Line is the city's most honest infrastructure in the sense that it cannot lie about its function: it moves the right creatures quickly and the wrong creatures not at all. The fare from Bronxborow to Melborow Central is calibrated to a Credit threshold that excludes any creature whose stone carries active Corvée-debt. This is not stated as policy. The fare machine simply declines the stone and generates an advisory suggesting the bearer *"consider alternative transit modes,"* which is the machine's way of saying *walk*.

Below the Sump Line, in the service tunnels that run parallel to the transit rails, the Platypus Ghost Network flows. Invisible. Unacknowledged. Keeping the water moving through pipes whose maintenance budget was reallocated to the Cathedral's Glow-Panel upgrade seven years ago.

They don't take fares. They don't take notice. They do the work that keeps the whole machine running, in the dark, in the gaps between the infrastructure the city has decided it officially has.

The city has decided it officially doesn't have them.

They're fine with this. They were never interested in official.
