# The Cathedral / *Ondoyána*

*The elite district. Candle-lit chambers carved from the densest, most resonant stone. Where Muskbat and the High-Noses reside. The walls are thick. The walls do not crack. The walls do not know what is happening below.*

## Physical Description

Not a religious building in the human sense—no nave, no altar, no iconography of worship. The Cathedral is a district, a volume of particularly resonant stone that the earliest settlers recognized as special and the current elite have made their own.

**The Stone:** Dense, warm, responsive. The substrate here is different—older, more compacted, with acoustic properties that make whispered conversations carry and shouted arguments reverberate into music. The Council did not choose this location by accident. The stone itself amplifies authority.

**The Ceilings:** High. Higher than the Grotto's sagging crowns by an order of magnitude. A wombat can stand fully upright, can stretch, can dig vertical shafts without the claustrophobia that defines life below. The height creates a psychology: space as privilege, air as status.

**The Chambers:** Carved with precision. Not the organic curves of the Grotto but geometric forms—arches, domes, the occasional perfect circle. The architecture speaks of planning, of resources, of time. These chambers were not dug by families in spare hours. They were excavated by Corvée labor under professional direction.

## The Northern Face

A sheer wall of polished substrate that Cooroo uses as an echo-surface for his frequency checks.

The Face is the Cathedral's acoustic masterpiece. Sound directed at it returns with perfect fidelity, the reflections combining in ways that reveal the Cathedral's internal state. Cooroo knows the Face's moods—the particular quality of echo when the Frequency is stable, the particular distortion when something is wrong.

The blueprints for the Melborow Frequency were drawn here. The wall does not remember. The wall only reflects.

## The Glow Room / *Calasambë*

Beneath the Cathedral, a phosphorescent chamber where bioluminescent fungi are cultivated.

**The Natural Light:** Warm, amber, organic. The fungi grow in ordered rows on stone shelves, fed by mineral solutions, harvested when their glow peaks. The light quality is imperfect—flickering, variable, dependent on the fungi's health. But it is alive.

**The Synthetic Replacement:** The High-Noses have been gradually replacing the fungi with light panels powered by the Melborow Frequency. The synthetic light is brighter. More consistent. More controllable.

It is also the wrong color. The panels produce a white-blue light that makes the stone look dead, that makes flesh look bloodless, that erases the shadows where secrets live.

The transition is gradual. One shelf at a time. The Cathedral's residents do not notice the change, or claim not to, or prefer the consistency of the new light to the warmth of the old.

## The Freeze Room / *Ringasambë*

Sub-Level 4. A super-cooled chamber beneath the Cathedral where Vitabat and Zuckbat conduct their audits.

**The Temperature:** Four degrees. Cold enough to preserve data integrity. Cold enough to remind everyone present that warmth is a resource the Council controls.

**The Function:** Server farm for the Tally. The split-stones are stored here, the records of every wombat's debt, the algorithmic calculations of labor value and Advance rates. The cold slows the stone's resonance, prevents degradation, maintains the precision of the notches.

**The Psychology:** Entering the Freeze Room requires preparation. You feel the cold before you feel the data. By the time you are presented with the Tally records, your body has already understood: this is a place of preservation, not life.

## Sensory Texture

**Touch:** The walls are smooth, polished, maintained. No weep here—the drainage is engineered, functional, invisible. The stone feels different from Grotto clay: harder, more resonant, responsive to pressure in ways that suggest structure rather than yielding.

**Sound:** Amplified. A whisper carries. A footstep echoes. The Cathedral's acoustic design makes privacy difficult and authority easy—the Council's voices fill the chambers, while dissent must be conducted in the specific dead zones that Cooroo has mapped but not shared.

**Smell:** Clean. Filtered air, circulated through systems the Lo Snouts cannot access. The faint mineral smell of resonant stone. The absence of mold, of weep, of the organic decomposition that marks the Grotto.

**Sight:** The synthetic light, increasingly. The amber fungal glow, decreasingly. The candle-light that the High-Noses favor for private chambers—ostentatious in its waste, performative in its warmth.

## Cultural Resonance

The Cathedral is the Crown—the literal and symbolic center of Melborow's hierarchy. To live here is to have arrived. To work here is to have proximity to power. To visit here from below is to understand, in your body, the difference between the Lo Snouts and the High-Noses.

**The Ritualized Life:** Life in the Cathedral is performance. The Frequency Dancers perform the manufactured Spiral-Step for audiences who know it is manufactured. The Council meets in chambers designed to amplify their voices. The architecture itself is a constant reminder: you are here because you matter, and you matter because you are here.

**The Golden Cage:** The High-Noses cannot leave easily. Their status requires presence. TheirFiltered Frequency requires proximity to the Cathedral's resonant stone. They are imprisoned by their privilege, and they call it home.

## Drip Elements

**Fragments:** The blueprints for the Melborow Frequency, stored in a chamber that hums at a specific pitch. The candle-light tradition, which younger High-Noses find quaint and older ones find essential. The specific dead zone where Cooroo conducts his private frequency checks.

**Contested Claims:**
- Muskbat: "The Cathedral's stone is the foundation of our civilization. Its resonance is what makes the Frequency possible."
- Hangbat (via Hoebat's memory): "The Cathedral was built on the Dust-Bearers' sacred ground. The resonance they honored, the Council exploits."
- The Lo Snouts: "The Cathedral takes our water, our Arnam, our labor. It gives back the Frequency and calls it fair trade."

**What the reader feels:** The space of authority. The amplification of voice. The cold that preserves rather than nurtures. The specific emptiness of a place that has optimized for control and lost something unnamed in the process.
