# The Eastern Ridge / *Amba Rómen*

*The long spine of elevated ground where the Great Wattle stood. The front line. The place where the schism is written in the ground itself.*

## Physical Description

A north-south elevation on the eastern shell, rising from the surrounding scrub like a vertebra exposed through skin. The ridge is not sharp—it has the rounded quality of ancient weathering, the curves that water and wind make when given centuries to work on stone.

At its highest point: **The Stump**. What remains of the Great Wattle. Warm to the touch, even in the coldest season. The break-face exposes heartwood crystallized in hexagonal facets—geometric, beautiful, sterile. The wood does not rot. It has become something else.

**The Bad Grounds** spread down the western slope. The lattice patterning—hexagonal, interlocking—advances incrementally each season. The ground looks tiled, artificial, like something built rather than grown. It is warm like the Stump but dead. No roots penetrate it. No insects live in it. It makes a sound when walked on: a faint, high hum, like a bell that never stops ringing.

The eastern slope is different. Still scrub. Still rough. Still alive. The boundary between living and dead ground is not a line but a frayed edge, a zone where the lattice tries to advance and the scrub resists. In this zone, the plants grow twisted. The eucalyptus drops its bark in strips that curl like questions.

## The Eastern Ridge Shaft

A vertical column connecting the surface to the tunnels below. One of the few places where underground air meets the sky.

The Shaft is warm—warmer than it should be. Air rises from below carrying the mineral smell of deep clay. The walls are lined with handholds carved by generations of wombats. Some are worn smooth. Some are new, rough, urgent.

At the surface: a stone rim, eroded, ancient. The rim is carved with markings nobody can read anymore. A fragment of Nāda, perhaps. Or just decoration. The distinction has been lost.

At the bottom: the Shaft opens into the mid-level tunnels. The air pressure changes. The sound changes. The Frequency reaches the Shaft but cannot climb it—the stone is too old, too resonant, too different from the Grout that carries the synthetic signal elsewhere.

## Sensory Texture

**Touch:** The Stump's surface is smooth as glass where the crystal has formed, rough as bark where it has not. The temperature differential is unsettling—standing with one paw on each surface feels like standing between two climates.

**Sound:** The Bad Grounds hum. The living slope does not. The boundary zone produces interference—two frequencies meeting, neither winning. In certain weather, the interference becomes audible: a low thrum felt in the sternum before it is heard.

**Smell:** The eastern slope smells of eucalyptus, of leaf-litter decomposition, of the particular mineral tang that rises before rain. The Bad Grounds smell of nothing. Or rather: they smell of the absence of smell, which is itself a kind of presence.

**Sight:** The horizon curves upward here—more so than in the lowlands, because the Ridge is elevated. The Nico Star hangs at the center of the visible sky, but from the Ridge's height, you can see more of the shell's curve. The Star appears closer. Some say it is.

## Cultural Resonance

The Ridge is contested ground. Not politically—the Sovereign Council claims it, has always claimed it—but culturally. The Fixed Borrows maintain that the Ridge was sacred to the Dust-Bearers. The Cathedral claims it was always Crown property. The Kappa Mu whispers that the Ridge is where the first wailing dance was performed, before the Council, before the Wall, before the schism had a name.

The truth is unavailable. What remains: the Stump, the Bad Grounds, the Shaft, the frayed edge where living and dead negotiate daily.

## The Rosella Parliament (Absent)

They are gone. Only the staining remains—centuries of droppings on the Heights' rock, which the Rosellas called "mineral deposits" and no one else called that. The staining is orange-red, iron-rich, fractal in its patterning. It is the only proof they were ever here.

Some Galahs still roost in the Canopy Remnant—scattered trees southeast of the Ridge. But the trees are functionally deaf. They don't conduct, don't amplify, don't resonate. They're just wood. The Galahs know this. They roost there anyway, because the alternative is the Heights, and the Heights are too heavy with absence.

## Drip Elements

**Fragments:** The carved rim of the Shaft. A children's game played on the eastern slope—"find the curve," they call it, hunting for the spiral patterns in the weathered stone. The game has no rules anyone can articulate. It is just: find the curve. Point to it. Move on.

**Contested Claims:**
- Tatebat: "The Ridge has always been Crown property. The Stump is a memorial to the tragedy of the fall."
- Cornelibat (in Hoebat's memory): "The Stump is a door that closed. The warmth is what leaks through."
- Chora-Mu: "The Bad Grounds are the future. The lattice is not death—it is the next form. We should learn to walk on it."

**What the reader feels:** The forward motion of something that does not care about the creatures living on it. The specific grief of a place that was alive and is becoming something else. The warmth as both comfort and warning.
