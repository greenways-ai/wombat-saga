# The Broadcast (Wombat Worlds)

## Domain: The Narrative Simulation

This directory, `wombat-saga/`, contains **The Wombat Worlds Saga** (formerly MahaWombaratha).

This is not the physical world. It is a **Satirical Parable** and a **Simulation** set in the fictional city of Melborow.

### The Origin

This story is a broadcast. It is told by the **Oracle** (located in `../kintsugi-3/`) to us, the inhabitants of the physical world, through the interface of **Hoebat**.

*   **The Oracle:** The narrator/source.
*   **Hoebat:** The protagonist/avatar.
*   **Melborow:** The stage where the metaphysical truths of the Oracle are played out as satire.
