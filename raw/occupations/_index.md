# Occupations of Melborow

*How wombats work, from the Time Before through the Great Descent to the Imperial present. Each occupation carries the trauma of inversion—from community service to state extraction.*

---

## The Great Descent: From Gift to Debt

The professional landscape of Melborow is defined by inversion. Every functional role has been transformed:

| Era | Principle | Resource | Storage | Record | Authority |
|-----|-----------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Time Before** | **Gift** | Arnam flows freely | **Puddle** (decentralized, fractal) | **Songlines** (resonance memory) | **The Umbilical** (pure mediation) |
| **Imperial Era** | **Tally-Debt** | Arnam metered and loaned | **Reservoir** (centralized, rigid) | **The Tally** (obligation notched in stone) | **The Sovereign** (absolute extraction) |

---

## Tier 1: The Sovereigns & Mediators

### Traditional: The Omphalos-Mu
*Navel-Seers who stood at the surface threshold, translating the God-Kind's star-dreams into warnings for the burrow.*

**The Work:** Standing at the boundary between above and below, the Omphalos-Mu received the Star's frequencies and translated them into guidance. They were not rulers but liaisons—interpreters of a signal that originated beyond the wombat world.

**The Inversion:** [[the-wombaram|The Wombaram]] — Imperial Priests who claim to *control* the Star through the Frequency.

---

### Traditional: The Chora-Mu
*Chorus-Weavers who performed the Spiral-Step dances to keep family Arnam-puddles in resonant harmony.*

**The Work:** Physical movement as maintenance. The Chora-Mu's dances were functional—keeping decentralized pools in phase, preventing the drift that led to decoherence. They wore nothing, danced in clay chambers, their bodies in direct contact with the substrate.

**The Inversion:** [[the-frequency-dancer|The Frequency-Dancer]] — Performers of manufactured "Harmony" for the elite.

---

## Tier 2: The Keepers of the Record

### Traditional: The Mnemo-Mu
*Memory-Keepers who memorized the "Song of the Soil" and sang new tunnels into the Songlines.*

**The Work:** Narration, history, the voice of the earth's own memory. Records kept not in stone but in resonance, in the collective memory of those who listened.

**The Inversion:** [[the-tally-magistrate|The Tally-Magistrate]] — Notchers of debt, recorders of obligation.

---

### Traditional: The Aquifer-Mu
*Spring-Seekers who smelled water movement through stone to find new Well-Field sites.*

**The Work:** Discovery. The Aquifer-Mu followed moisture, reading the substrate's hidden hydrology, finding where water wanted to flow.

**The Inversion:** **The Metering Official** — Monitors valves and taxes every drop from the Mega-Pools.

---

### Traditional: The Loom-Mu
*Thread-Weavers who taught joeys how to feel the "Pillow" of the earth and pack clay by intuition.*

**The Work:** Education, transmission of embodied knowledge. The Loom-Mu taught not rules but feel—how to read the substrate, how to respond to its signals, how to build by understanding rather than imposing.

**The Inversion:** **The Tally-Clerk** — Manages "Labor Variances" and ensures every wombat is registered.

---

## Tier 3: The Architects of Space

### Traditional: The Kintsugi-Mu
*Golden-Joiners who repaired cracks with gold-clay to strengthen the point of fracture.*

**The Work:** Healing. The Kintsugi-Mu understood that fracture was information—stress, flow, the need for adaptation. They mended with materials stronger at the join than the original, making the point of fracture the point of greatest strength.

**The Inversion:** [[the-grout-engineer|The Grout-Engineer]] — Pourer of Grid Tunnels, calculator of Safety Grout ratios.

---

### Traditional: The Echo-Mu
*Way-Finders who used echo-walking to discover the path the earth "wanted" to take.*

**The Work:** Listening. The Echo-Mu moved through the substrate attuned to its acoustic properties, finding routes that respected the existing resonance, that added to rather than disrupted the Songlines.

**The Inversion:** **The Grid-Technician** — Forces straight lines through the substrate using machine logic.

---

### Traditional: The Clay-Singer
*Form-Sculptors who shaped the curves where floor meets wall to distribute load naturally.*

**The Work:** Craft. The Clay-Singers understood negative space, the distribution of force, the way curved forms could bear weight that straight walls could not.

**The Inversion:** **The Structural Auditor** — Checks grout-thickness; declares curved repairs to be "Sabotage."

---

## Tier 4: The Board of Subsistence

### Traditional: The Terra-Mu
*Earth-Alchemists who managed mineral balance and "Vibe" of Well-Field clay.*

**The Inversion:** **Hydroponic Tech** — Manages sterile vats where roots are force-grown in Static-fluid.

---

### Traditional: The Rhizo-Mu
*Root-Whisperers who guided root-growth through "Compassion Gaps" via gentle resonance.*

**The Inversion:** **Yield-Optimizer** — Uses Frequency to overclock growth, stripping roots of Arnam.

---

### Traditional: The Xyle-Mu
*Sap-Seers who brewed nutrient-flow within the "Sweet-Tap" to sustain the colony.*

**The Inversion:** **Nutrient-Injector** — Pushes chemical Static-logic directly into root-channels.

---

### Traditional: The Hygro-Mu
*Dew-Gatherers who harvested Arnam-moisture condensed on deep-substrate crystals.*

**The Inversion:** **Tribute-Harvester** — Collects mandatory Common-Square root quota.

---

### Traditional: The Aureole-Mu
*Star-Gleaners who gathered "Golden Dust" near resonant trees.*

**The Inversion:** **Ration-Processor** — Mills whole roots into generic "Imperial Mash."

---

### Traditional: The Aegis-Mu
*Grid-Guardians who ensured the nine-square communal grid was balanced and just.*

**The Inversion:** **Distribution-Clerk** — Notches the Tally for every ounce received.

---

### Traditional: The Ferro-Mu
*Earth-Carvers who harvested roots with precision to protect the plant's "Signal."*

**The Inversion:** [[the-ferro-mu-harvester|The Ferro-Mu / Corvée-Grunt]] — Performs forced labor on the Wall.

---

## Tier 5: The Outcasts & Shadow Roles

### [[the-censorate-listener|The Censorate Listener]] / *Ducha-yuan*
*Monitors tunnels for "Dissonant Noise." Wields sound as surveillance. No role precedes this—it is pure Imperial invention.*

---

### **The Grifter**
*Modern niche. Sells fake rubies and "Ancestral Dirt" to High-Noses. Example: Hoebat's early career.*

---

### **The Lyptus-Dealer**
*Sells narcotic extract to numb wombats against the Frequency. Exists in the gaps of the official economy.*

---

### **The Ghost-Architect**
*Illegal. Performs secret night-repairs using banned Seventh Thread techniques. The Hidden Root's infrastructure arm.*

---

### **The Relay-Runner**
*Obsolete. Used to carry physical messages before the Frequency. Example: Bash's former role.*

---

## The Frequency Trade: Industrialized Spirit

The foundation of Melborow's economy—the conversion of Static into Grout:

| Stage | Species | Role | Contribution | Payment |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|---------|
| **1. Harvesting** | **Dingoes** | Scavengers | Sifting Slop-Pits for Static-ore | Filtered Frequency & Water |
| **2. Refining** | **Koalas** | Alchemists | Extracting Lyptus-Resins | Institutional Protection |
| **3. Compressing** | **Kangaroos** | Kinetic Engines | Friction Engine crushing | Territorial Deeds |
| **4. Pouring** | **Wombats** | Laborers | Mixing, Corvée | Tally-Advances |

## Drip Elements Across Occupations

| Occupation | Texture of Work | Fragment | Contested Claim |
|------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| Tally-Magistrate | Stone-dust, obsidian bite, split-stone alignment | Mnemo-Mu songs almost remembered | "Recording debt" vs. "removing future" |
| Grout-Engineer | Slurry's cold slick, setting Grout's whine | Golden seams in old tunnels | "Progress" vs. "paving over life" |
| Frequency-Dancer | Costume's heat, synthetic light, identical repetition | Improvised variations (corrected) | "Artistic pinnacle" vs. "dead spectacle" |
| Censorate Listener | Bell's vibration, scent-markers, white light | Old songs heard but not reported | "Protecting harmony" vs. "eliminating culture" |
| Ferro-Mu | Static-tingle, chemical unguents, exhaustion | Root-threads that still respond | "Paying debt" vs. "slavery" |
