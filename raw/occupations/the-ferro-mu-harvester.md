# The Ferro-Mu / Harvester

*Once the Earth-Carvers who harvested roots with precision to protect the plant's "Signal." Now: the Corvée-Grunt, performing forced labor on the Wall to pay off Tally-notches. From craft to slavery.*

## The Work

**The Wall:** The Great Retaining Wall rises through the substrate, a vertical plane of Grout that divides the Grotto from the sectors beyond. The Ferro-Mu—those who work the Corvée—dig its foundations, pour its sections, maintain its structural integrity. They do not design it. They do not choose to build it. They work because their Tally-Stones demand it.

**The Labor:** Heavy, repetitive, dangerous. The Ferro-Mu move Static-laden substrate, mix Grout components, pour the slurry into molds that will become the Wall's next section. The work requires strength, endurance, the capacity to continue when the body wants to stop. The Corvée does not accommodate injury, illness, exhaustion. The Tally-notch requires payment. The body must provide.

**The Rotation:** Most Corvée labor is rotating—shifts of workers moving through different tasks, different locations, spreading the burden. But the Wall is permanent. The Ferro-Mu assigned to it may spend months, even years, in the same sector, performing the same motions, watching the Wall grow incrementally toward its designed height. They know the Wall's texture better than their own burrow walls.

## The Sensory World

**Touch:** Static-laden substrate produces a specific sensation—not pain, exactly, but interference. The hands tingle. The paws feel distant, as if belonging to someone else. The Grout slurry is cold, slick, chemical. It dries the skin, cracks the pads, requires constant treatment with Council-provided unguents that smell of medicine and failure.

**Sound:** The Wall's construction produces its own acoustic signature—the pour's liquid rush, the setting Grout's faint whine, the rhythmic impact of tools against hardened sections. But beneath these sounds, the Ferro-Mu hears the substrate. Or rather: hears what the substrate has become. The root-networks are severed here. The Arnam is absent. The earth does not respond to digging as it should.

**Smell:** Static has a smell, or perhaps the nose interprets its interference as smell—metallic, sharp, like lightning or blood. The Grout has its chemical scent. The Ferro-Mu's own body, exhausted, produces odors of stress and exertion. The combination is the smell of the Corvée: industrial, desperate, relentless.

**Sight:** The Wall dominates vision—gray, vertical, featureless except for the construction joints that mark each pour. Above: the tunnel ceiling, sagging, weeping. Below: the trench that will become the next section's foundation. Around: other Ferro-Mu, similarly marked by labor, similarly focused on tasks that require attention but not thought.

## The Inversion

**What Was:** The Ferro-Mu were Earth-Carvers, practitioners of a craft that required precision, knowledge, respect for the root-networks they harvested. They understood that roots conducted Arnam, that careless cutting severed signal, that the colony's nourishment depended on their skill. They were artisans, not laborers—valued for their judgment, their technique, their capacity to read the substrate and respond appropriately.

**What Is:** The Corvée-Grunt requires no skill. Strength, endurance, compliance—these are the qualifications. The Wall does not require judgment. It requires effort. The Ferro-Mu of today dig not for nourishment but for debt-payment. Their labor produces not sustenance but structural elements that serve the Council's purposes. They are not craftsmen. They are raw material.

**The Trauma:** Some Corvée workers remember, or were taught, the old techniques. Their families were Ferro-Mu before the Tally, before the Corvée, before the Wall. They know that the roots they sever now are the same roots their ancestors harvested with care. They know that their labor is destructive where their ancestors' was sustaining. They dig anyway. The Tally-Stone requires it.

## Daily Life

**The Morning Roll:** The Ferro-Mu gather at designated muster points, present their Tally-Stones, receive their assignments. The roll is efficient, impersonal, designed to process large numbers quickly. Names are less important than numbers. Bodies are less important than labor units. The system functions.

**The Shift:** Typically twelve hours, though overtime is common and mandatory when the Wall's schedule requires acceleration. Breaks are brief, regulated, insufficient for genuine rest. Food is provided—Imperial Mash, the generic nutrient paste that sustains without satisfying. Water is metered. The body is maintained at functional minimum.

**The Injury:** Common, expected, poorly treated. The Corvée provides basic medical care—sufficient to return the worker to labor, insufficient to address underlying damage. Chronic injuries accumulate. Older Ferro-Mu move differently, their bodies adapted to pain, their movements optimized around limitation. They work until they cannot. Then they are replaced.

## Psychological Texture

**The Count:** Days remaining until the Tally-Debt is paid. Hours remaining in the current shift. Notches on the stone that represent the future already spent. The count is constant, obsessive, necessary. Without the count, the work becomes endless. With the count, it is merely long.

**The Dream:** Sleep, when it comes, is heavy, dreamless, insufficient. But occasionally—particularly in newer workers, particularly when exhaustion produces altered states—the Ferro-Mu dreams of the old ways. Of roots harvested with care, of the substrate responding to skill, of work that produced nourishment rather than structure. They wake to the Wall, the Grout, the Corvée. The dream is worse than no dream at all.

**The Defense:** "I am paying my debt. I took the Advance. I accepted the terms. This is not slavery—it is obligation. Once the notches are cleared, I will be free. The system is fair. The system is fair. The system is fair."

## Drip Elements

**Fragments:** The occasional root-thread that responds to touch, that seems to conduct something despite the Static, that suggests the Arnam is not entirely absent. The old techniques remembered by older workers, passed surreptitiously to younger ones, performed furtively when supervisors are not watching. The specific resonance of certain Wall sections, different from the Grout's usual scream, that suggests variation in the construction.

**Contested Claims:**
- The Council's Corvée administration: "The Ferro-Mu are paying legitimate debt through legitimate labor. The Wall benefits all Melborow. The terms are clear and fair."
- The Kappa Mu: "The Tally-Debt is designed to be unpayable. The Ferro-Mu are slaves by another name. The Wall serves only the Council's power."
- The Ferro-Mu themselves: "We work. We survive. We count the days. What other claims matter?"

**What the reader feels:** The weight of labor—the body's exhaustion, the repetition, the sense of time transformed into obligation. The specific dignity of work performed under compulsion. The distance between craft and survival.
