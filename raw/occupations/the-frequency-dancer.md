# The Frequency-Dancer / *Wombiki*

*Once the Chora-Mu, Chorus-Weavers who performed the Spiral-Step to keep family Arnam-puddles in resonant harmony. Now: the performer of manufactured movement in the Cathedral, mimicking "Harmony" for the elite, the body made into propaganda.*

## The Work

**The Performance:** Every cycle, the Dancers gather in the Cathedral's resonant chambers to perform the Spiral-Step. The movement is ancient—curved, spiraling, the body following paths that never repeat exactly. But the performance is new. The Frequency that accompanies it is synthetic, manufactured, filtered from the Static that drowns the true Arnam.

**The Costume:** The Dancers wear garments that amplify their movements—flowing fabrics that catch the air, create visible trails, make the body's paths legible to observers at a distance. The colors are specific: gold for the lead Dancer, silver for the chorus, the occasional flash of violet for moments of scripted intensity. The costumes are heavy, hot, restrictive. They are not designed for the Dancer's comfort but for the audience's perception.

**The Audience:** High-Noses. The Fixed. Occasionally, a visiting official from another district. They do not participate. They observe. The Dancers perform *for* them, their bodies a demonstration of the Council's success, the Frequency's efficacy, the harmony that supposedly pervades Melborow's upper levels.

## The Sensory World

**Touch:** The costume fabric is synthetic, produced in Council manufactories. It does not breathe. It traps heat, moisture, the Dancer's own exertion. Under the costume, the Dancer's fur is matted, uncomfortable, constantly damp. The sensation becomes normal over time—the Dancer forgets what it felt like to move in natural fur, to feel air on skin, to be unencumbered.

**Sound:** The Frequency. Constant, rhythmic, artificial. It is not the Arnam's subtle vibration but a manufactured pulse, loud enough to be unmistakable, regular enough to be predictable. The Dancer moves *to* it, their body's rhythm synchronized to its beat. The true Spiral-Step responded to subtler frequencies—to root-growth, to moisture movement, to the substrate's own song. The Frequency Dancer responds only to what is broadcast.

**Smell:** The Cathedral's filtered air, scrubbed of organic traces, scented with mild chemical fresheners. The Dancer's own sweat, trapped by the costume, becoming familiar. The absence of root-smell, of clay, of the organic decomposition that marked the old performances' settings.

**Sight:** The Cathedral's polished stone, reflecting the Dancers' movements in distorted arcs. The audience, seated in rows, their faces illuminated by synthetic light. The other Dancers, synchronized, uniform, their individual variations smoothed by rehearsal into collective precision.

## The Inversion

**What Was:** The Chora-Mu performed the Spiral-Step for function, not display. Their dances maintained the resonant harmony of family Arnam-puddles, kept the small decentralized pools in phase with each other, prevented the drift that led to decoherence. They danced in clay chambers, wearing nothing, their bodies in direct contact with the substrate that received their vibration. The performance was sanctification—the body as instrument, the movement as prayer.

**What Is:** The Frequency-Dancer performs for observation. Their movement is choreographed, rehearsed, identical from performance to performance. They dance in the Cathedral's resonant stone, elevated, separated from the substrate by floors of Grout. The performance is spectacle—the body as display, the movement as advertisement for a harmony that does not exist.

**The Trauma:** Some Dancers remember, or sense, the difference. Their bodies know that the Spiral-Step should vary, should respond, should be alive. They feel the wrongness of identical repetition, the deadness of performance without function. They dance anyway. The costumes are expensive. The training is extensive. The alternatives are the Corvée, the Grotto, the Tally-Debt.

## Daily Life

**The Rehearsal:** Hours each day, perfecting synchrony. The lead Dancer sets the pattern; the chorus follows. Individual variation is error. The Frequency provides the beat; the Dancers match their movement to its pulse. The rehearsal is physical labor—exhausting, repetitive, demanding. The Dancers' bodies are strong, flexible, disciplined. They are also hurting, always, from the strain of maintaining positions that look beautiful but feel wrong.

**The Performance Schedule:** Regular performances for the Cathedral's residents, special performances for Council events, occasional tours to other districts where the Frequency reaches. The schedule is determined by the Council's needs, not the Dancers' capacities. Injuries are common. Injured Dancers are replaced. The show continues.

**The Retirement:** There is no formal retirement. Dancers continue until injury or age makes them unable to perform the required movements. Former Dancers become instructors, choreographers, costume maintainers—still within the performance system, still dependent on its continuation. Few escape entirely. The skills do not transfer. The body is marked by the training.

## Psychological Texture

**The Applause:** The audience's response—measured, polite, never enthusiastic enough to disrupt the performance's dignity. The Dancers learn to read this applause, to distinguish genuine appreciation from obligation, to know when they have succeeded in creating the impression of harmony. The applause is their validation, their proof of worth, their reminder that they are seen.

**The Mirror:** Rehearsal spaces have mirrors—polished metal, expensive, showing the Dancers their own movements from outside. The mirror is the Dancer's primary training tool. They learn to see themselves as audience, to evaluate their bodies' appearance rather than their movement's felt quality. Over time, they lose the capacity to feel without seeing.

**The Defense:** "The old dances were primitive. They served small pools, small families, small purposes. Our performances serve the entire colony—they demonstrate the Frequency's power, the Council's success, the harmony that our civilization has achieved. We are artists. We are necessary. We are seen."

## Drip Elements

**Fragments:** The occasional variation—a Dancer who improvises, who lets their body respond to something other than the Frequency, who introduces a curve that the choreography did not specify. These variations are corrected, punished, eliminated. But they happen. The body remembers what the training suppresses.

**Contested Claims:**
- The Council's culture ministry: "The Frequency-Dancers are the pinnacle of wombat artistic achievement. Their performances demonstrate the harmony that the Council's governance makes possible."
- The old wombats: "They are not dancing. They are posing. The Spiral-Step was never meant to be identical twice. It was meant to respond, to adapt, to live."
- The Dancers themselves: "We are skilled. We work hard. What we do is difficult and beautiful. Does it matter if it is different from what came before?"

**What the reader feels:** The physical strain of performance—the heat of the costume, the repetition of rehearsal, the body's rebellion against identical movement. The specific sadness of someone skilled at something that should be alive but is dead. The distance between sanctification and spectacle.
