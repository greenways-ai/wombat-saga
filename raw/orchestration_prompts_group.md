# Orchestration Prompts for Group Shots

## 🏛️ The Cathedral Shot (The 5 Sovereigns)

**[GLOBAL STYLE START]:**
"A panoramic, cinematic Chibi Anime illustration. Style: High-fashion dystopian editorial (Vogue meets Metropolis) mixed with religious iconography. Color Palette: Gold, White, Black, Electric Blue, and Moss Green. 8k resolution, wide-angle lens, symmetrical composition."

**[CHARACTER BIBLE]:**
"Characters: The 5 Sovereign Wombats, lined up like the Olympic Rings (overlapping circles of power).

1.  **Center (Earth):** **Trumbat**. Radiant white fur, deep purple eyes, golden mitre, silky gold robes. He stands tallest, arms raised in a priestly blessing.
2.  **Left Inner (Water):** **Vitabat**. Scarred, wearing a tailored white suit with an ice-blue tie. His metal robotic left arm is resting ominously on a frozen ledger. He looks cold and menacing.
3.  **Right Inner (Metal):** **Tatebat**. Manicured purple fur, shutter shades, oversized Yeezy-style robes. He is striking a manic 'Visionary' pose, holding a glowing Arnam-Mic like a sceptre.
4.  **Left Outer (Fire):** **Muskbat**. Twitchy, wearing a sleek black batsuit with an Inspector Gadget-style jetpack and AR goggles. He is hovering slightly off the ground, surrounded by holographic error messages.
5.  **Right Outer (Wood):** **Zuckbat**. A hooded figure in a dark green robe/hoodie. Static blue and red math equations are growing out of his pockets like magical vines. He is looking down at a datapad, ignoring the camera."

**[PAGE-SPECIFIC ACTION]:**
"Scene: The five Sovereigns are standing on the balcony of the High-Bureau, overlooking the sprawling, smog-filled city of Melborow. Behind them, the Great Retaining Wall rises like a mountain. The lighting is 'Golden Hour' sunset, casting long, dramatic shadows. They represent the 5 Elements (Earth, Water, Metal, Fire, Wood) twisted into a knot of control."

**[GLOBAL STYLE END]:**
"Aesthetic: Symmetrical composition, lens flare, high-contrast textures (silk, metal, ice, hologram), 'The Oligarchy' atmosphere, masterpiece quality."
