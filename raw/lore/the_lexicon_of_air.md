# The Avian Lexicon of Air (Vilya-Lambë)

**"A bird who knows only 'Wind' is a bird who belongs to the ground."**
— *Keerik, Elder Galah*

To the birds of Hún Nico—the Galahs, Rosellas, and the predatory Wedgies—the air is not a void. It is a complex, multi-layered geography of texture, temperature, and speed. Accurate navigation depends on the precise naming of these conditions.

## 1. The Foundational Strata (The Pillars of the Sky)

| Term | English Equivalent | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Thúlë Lunga** | The Heavy Breath | The dense, humid, mud-scented air near the surface (0-2km). High lift, high drag. |
| **Súrë Axan** | The Law-Wind | The mid-level atmosphere (2-50km). Flows in perfect, laminar sheets. Geometric and cold. |
| **Lusta Ómëa** | The Frequency Void | The thin, stripped air near the Nico Star (>100km). Pure vibration, no oxygen. |

## 2. Navigational Textures (Flow and Chaos)

| Term | English Equivalent | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Axan-Vilya** | Laminar Flow | Air moving in perfect sheets. "Tiled air." The habitat of the Static-aligned Wedgies. |
| **Raca** | Turbulence | "Broken Air." Where the Law-Wind shatters against gnarled terrain or fractal objects. |
| **Omentiel** | Convergence | Where two air masses meet, forced upward into a "Wall of Lift." |
| **Halla-Hwë** | Wind Gradient | The rule that wind velocity increases with altitude. |
| **Ristë** | Wind Shear | A sharp boundary between two winds of different directions. Danger of "snapping." |

## 3. The Art of the Rise (Thermal and Dynamic Lift)

| Term | English Equivalent | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arnam-Ringa** | Thermal Lift | A column of rising warm air. Traditionally fueled by Arnam; now by Static reflections. |
| **Amba-Túcë** | Ridge Lift | Mechanical lift generated when wind hits a vertical face (e.g., Windbreak Cliffs). |
| **Anar-Nirë** | Anabatic Wind | Warm air rising up the heart-slopes during the "Swell Phase." |
| **Isil-Nirë** | Katabatic Wind | Cold, heavy air sliding down into the valleys during the "Dim Phase." |
| **Palar-Tinta** | Thermal Trigger | A "Hot Spot" on the plains (dark rock or crystal pool) where thermals break loose. |

## 4. Currents and Directionality

| Term | English Equivalent | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Andunë-Sírë** | West-Flow | The prevailing wind flowing from the Western Shell to the Eastern Ridge. |
| **Rómen-Sírë** | East-Flow | The rare, moist "Return Wind" from the Jacaranda territory. |
| **Hwindi-Oira** | The Eternal Spin | The toroidal vortex circulating inside the Heart-Cavity. |
| **Gargantua** | The Venturi | Air accelerated through narrow gaps, specifically the Shattered Gorge. |
| **Napa-Tië** | Beak-Path | Heading (where the beak is pointing). |
| **Talan-Tië** | Ground-Path | Track (where the bird is actually moving across the dirt). |
| **Lasta** | The Drift | The lateral offset caused by crosswinds. |

## 5. Topographical Features

| Term | English Equivalent | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ramba-Nirë** | Wall-Push | Constant lift found on the windward side of a cliff. |
| **Rotor** | The Tumbler | Violent, vertical air vortices found on the lee side (Shadow) of a cliff. |
| **Roto-Súrë** | Cave-Breath | Low-pressure air huffing out of wombat tunnels. |
| **Tië-Ringa** | Cloud Street | A line of thermals allowing for "Highway" gliding without flapping. |

## 6. Avian Slang (The Cockpit Voice)

*   **"Glass-Air"**: Highly laminar air in the Law-Wind.
*   **"The Wash"**: The wake turbulence left behind by a squad of hunting Wedgies.
*   **"Coring"**: Finding the exact center (**Yá**) of a thermal to maximize ascent.
*   **"Getting Vectored"**: Being locked into a Wedgie's Vector-Sight probability cone.
*   **"The Grout"**: Air so still and heavy it feels like flying through stone.
*   **"The Sink" (**Unq**)**: The downdraft area surrounding a thermal core.
