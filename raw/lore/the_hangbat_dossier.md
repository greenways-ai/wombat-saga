# The Hangbat Dossier: A Council Threat Assessment

**Subject:** Hangbat (The Beggar / The Trickster)
**Classification:** **Category 5 Systemic Threat** (Cognitive Hazard)
**Status:** *Liquidated (Officially) / At Large (Suspected)*

The State (The Five-I's Council) did not fear Hangbat because he was strong. They feared him because he was **Funny**. In a system built on the gravity of "Serious Grout," a creature who treats the walls as a joke is a structural liability.

Here are the four primary reasons why the **High-Noses** dragged Uncle Hangbat into the dark and tried to erase his name from the Ledger.

## 1. The Linguistic Breach (The Dingo Code)
**The Crime:** *Unauthorized Interspecies Communication.*

The stability of Melborow relies on the **"Fortress Logic"**: Wombats are the Diggers, Dingoes are the Eaters. Fear of the "Wild Dog" keeps the population paying their Grout-Taxes and staying inside the Wall.

Hangbat broke the narrative. He didn't just survive the Dingoes; he **talked** to them.
*   **The Threat:** By learning the **Dingo-Tongue** and the **Watcher's Frequency**, Hangbat proved that the "Enemy" was actually a "Neighbor."
*   **The Implication:** If the Dingoes are not mindless monsters, then the Wall is not necessary. If the Wall is not necessary, the Council's primary justification for power dissolves. Hangbat didn't just learn a language; he dismantled the border.

## 2. The Frequency Sabotage (The Jar of Silence)
**The Crime:** *Resonance Terrorism.*

The **Melborow Frequency** is the heartbeat of the State. It keeps the population calm, productive, and unaware of the crumbling substrate.
*   **The Myth:** The legend says Hangbat spilled a "Jar of Silence" from the Platypus.
*   **The Reality:** Hangbat discovered **Anti-Resonance**. He identified the exact inverse frequency required to cancel out the Council's broadcast. He didn't create "silence"; he created **Null-Zones**.
*   **The Threat:** In these Null-Zones, wombats stopped working. They stopped marching. They started *thinking*. The Council realized that one unwashed wombat with a hollow log could crash the entire mood-grid of the city.

## 3. The Geological Heresy (The Klein Bottle Truth)
**The Crime:** *Denial of the Fixed Floor.*

The Council teaches **"The Solid Foundation."** The world is a bowl, and we are safe at the bottom.
*   **The Heresy:** Hangbat preached the **"Loop Logic."** He claimed the world wasn't a bowl, but a **Flow**. He taught that the "Bottom" (The Closing Node) wasn't a floor, but a drain.
*   **The Threat:** If the world is a drain, then "Safety Grout" is useless. You can't pave a vortex. Hangbat's geology suggested that the only way to survive was to *move* (Flow), not to *harden* (Grout). This challenged the entire construction industry of Melborow.

## 4. The Lineage Insult (The Machine Dream)
**The Crime:** *Sovereign Delegitimization.*

The Five-I's claim divine ancestry. They claim to be the pinnacle of Wombat Evolution.
*   **The Insult:** Hangbat openly laughed at the Sovereigns. He called **Trumbat** "The Wall waiting to crack" and **Muskbat** "The Battery waiting to die."
*   **The Secret Knowledge:** Hangbat knew the **Meta-Narrative**. He knew the Five-I's weren't evolved Wombats; they were **"Machine Dreams wearing Fur."** He saw them not as leaders, but as **glitches** in the Dreaming caused by the Tall-Ones' madness.
*   **The Fear:** A King can survive an assassin. A King cannot survive a Jester who knows he is made of tin.

## Conclusion: The "Madness" Strategy

The Council couldn't execute him publicly (he was too popular in the lower tunnels). So they branded him **"Mad."**
*   They claimed his Silence was "Catatonic Withdrawal."
*   They claimed his Dingo-Code was "Gibberish."
*   They pushed him into the shadows, hoping he would rot.

They didn't realize that by pushing him into the dark, they were sending him exactly where he needed to go to train the next generation.

**Hangbat wasn't hiding. He was waiting for Hoebat.**
