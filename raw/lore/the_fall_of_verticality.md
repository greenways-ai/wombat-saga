# The Fall of Verticality (The Coring Tree Failure)

## The Ancient Doctrine: Depth = Truth
For millennia, Arnamland operated on a vertical axis. The **Coring Trees** (Great Wattles, Red Gums) were the pillars of the world. Their taproots drilled kilometers into the substrate, bypassing the surface noise to drink from the **Deep Aquifer**—the "Source Water" closest to the Glass.
*   **The Wombat Duty:** The ancient **Tahl-Mu** (Tillers) believed their sacred duty was to protect these deep taproots. They dug vertical shafts to tend them. They believed that as long as the root touched the bottom, the tree would stand.

## The Catastrophe: The Poisoned Straw
When the **Static** (Crystalline Lattice) began to rise, it came from the bottom up—seeping from the 10km depth where the soil meets the Glass.
*   **The Infection:** The Coring Trees were the first to die precisely because they were the deepest. Their taproots acted as straws, sucking the concentrated geometric poison straight into their heartwood.
*   **The Wombat Failure:** The Wombats failed because they kept looking down. They saw the Static rising and tried to "brace" the deep roots with Grout. This was fatal. Bracing a tree that is turning to glass only ensures that when it shatters, it shatters explosively. The Wombats' obsession with **Verticality** blinded them to the fact that the Source itself had been corrupted.

## The Jacaranda Solution: The Horizontal Braid
The **Great Jacaranda** survives because it rejects the vertical doctrine.
*   **The Surface Web:** Its roots do not drill. They spread. They weave a massive, chaotic, horizontal web through the top 100 meters of soil—the "Messy Zone" where organic life, rot, and insects still disrupt the crystal lattice.
*   **The Interlocking Root (The Braid):** The Jacarandas are collectivists. Their vigorous roots do not just touch; they intertwine and fuse, creating a **Fractal Net** that links every tree in the grove. If one tree is hit by a Static surge, the energy is shunted across the web and diluted.
*   **The Raft:** The network does not try to anchor itself to the bottom of the world. It "floats" on top of the rising Static like a raft on ice. Its fractal root system breaks the surface tension of the crystal, creating **Compassion Gaps** (moisture pockets) simply by being too wide, too connected, and too messy to be tiled.

## The New Doctrine: Reach Out, Not Down
The **Kappa Mu** is built on this new geometry. The "Mu" (Gap) is no longer a vertical shaft; it is a horizontal connection.
*   **The Lesson:** The Deep Root is a trap. It connects you to a Source that has gone cold. The only way to survive the Crystallisation is to stop digging for a memory and start weaving a net with what remains.
*   **The Law of the Braid:** "The Wattle died because it wanted to be Deep. The Jacaranda lives because it wants to be Wide. Depth is a grave; Width is a world."
*   **The Shift:** The Wombats failed because they looked at the floor. The Kappa Mu succeeds because they look at each other.
