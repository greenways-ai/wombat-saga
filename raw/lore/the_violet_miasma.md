# The Violet Miasma (The Purple Haze)

**"It does not smell like rain. It smells like memory that has been left in the sun too long."**
— *Dingo Elder*

## The Phenomenon
The **Violet Miasma** is the atmospheric byproduct of the Great Jacaranda's transmutation process. It is the visible exhaust of the tree converting the **Static** (White Logic) into **Bio-Available Light** (Violet Life).

### 1. The Visual Aspect
*   **The Haze:** It manifests as a low-hanging, luminescent purple fog that clings to the floor of the Fractal Rainforest.
*   **The Filter:** It diffuses light. Inside the Miasma, there are no sharp shadows. Everything is soft-focus. To a Dingo (who relies on sharp edges to hunt), this is blinding. It creates a "Dream-State" visual field where distance is hard to judge.

### 2. The Olfactory Aspect
*   **The Scent:** It does not smell like the sharp, medicinal Menthol of the Eucalyptus.
*   **The Sweetness:** It smells cloying, floral, and impossibly sweet—like honey mixed with ozone.
*   **The "Choke":** To native creatures adapted to dry, dusty air, the Miasma feels thick in the lungs. It feels like breathing water. They describe it as a "perfumed suffocation."

### 3. The Psycho-Active Effect
*   **The Sedation:** The Miasma has a mild narcotic effect on creatures who are not used to it. It lowers aggression. It dampens the "Fight/Flight" response.
*   **The Threat:** The Anti-Jacaranda factions believe this is a weapon. They claim the tree is **drugging** the fauna into submission, making them too passive to resist the terraforming.
*   **The Reality:** The sedation is simply the effect of **High Empathy** particles in the air. For a creature addicted to the adrenaline of survival, peace feels like death.

## The Terraforming Agent
The Miasma is not just gas; it is a **Spore Cloud**.
*   **The Spread:** The Haze carries micro-particles that settle on the crystalline Static. Where they land, they "soften" the lattice, preparing the ground for the Jacaranda's roots.
*   **The Horror:** To the Traditionalists, the Miasma is the **"Breath of the Invader."** It precedes the roots. First the air turns purple, then the ground goes soft, then the history is erased.
