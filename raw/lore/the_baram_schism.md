# The Baram Schism: The Wombiki Sacrifices

**"They told us the Grout needed a soul to hold back the frost. We didn't realize they were the ones making the frost."**

Before the Five-I's, before the walls, and before the madness, there was the **Wombiki Order**.

The schism between **Trumbaram** (Trumbat) and **Howlbaram** (Hangbat) was not sparked by a single murder, but by the discovery of an **Industrial Cover-Up**. Howlbaram found that the foundation of Melborow’s stability was built on the blood of its most gifted artists.

## The Wombiki and the Wombarams
Melborow was governed by two halves of the same heart:
1.  **The Wombarams:** The priestly administration and architects (led by Trumbaram). They managed the **Tallies**, the Grout, and the safety codes.
2.  **The Wombiki:** The ancient order of dancers. They performed the **Spiral-Step**—a rhythmic packing of the soil that maintained the organic integrity of the burrows.

## The Justification: "Stopping the Crystallization"
As the **Static** (the Great Crystallization) began to rise, the Wombarams introduced a terrifying new doctrine: **The Living Foundation**.

They told the public that the only way to "bond" the Grout against the crystalline lattice was to anchor it with **Resonant Sacrifice**. They claimed that a Wombiki dancer, entombed within the wet Grout while performing their final Spiral-Step, would create a "Soul-Anchor" that the Static could not penetrate.

## The Discovery: The Efficacy Gap
As the High Priest of Rites, **Howlbaram** (Hangbat) was tasked with the spiritual oversight of these events. But when he looked for the results, he found a void.

1.  **No Documentation:** There were no **Tallies** tracking the "Stabilization Rates." No scientific evidence that a sacrificed dancer actually slowed the lattice spread.
2.  **The "Hope" Metric:** When he confronted Trumbaram, the response was chillingly pragmatic. Trumbat didn't claim the sacrifices worked; he claimed they were **Necessary for Morale**.
    > *"A wombat who believes their neighbor died to save them will work ten hours longer without complaining about the cracks. We aren't selling safety, Howlbaram. We are selling Hope. And Hope requires a price."*
3.  **The Routine:** What Howlbaram thought was a rare, tragic necessity was actually a routine industrial process. Wombiki dancers were being "retired" into the concrete foundations of every new sector, regardless of the soil's actual health.

## The Night of the Revelation
Howlbaram discovered that **Vara**, his own student and the most promising Wombiki of her generation, was scheduled for the "Consecration of Sector 7." 

He realized that the Wombarams weren't trying to stop the crystallization; they were using the *fear* of it to liquidate the only group that could prove the Grout was unnecessary—the Wombiki themselves. By sacrificing the dancers, they were destroying the competition and the evidence of the Old Ways simultaneously.

## The Confrontation and the Mask
Howlbaram stormed the Council, but he saw the Static already glittering in their eyes. He realized that if he spoke as a sane priest, he would be documented, filed, and "sacrificed" into the next wall to silence him.

He chose the **Beggar’s Mask**.

*   **The Act:** He didn't issue a manifesto. He interrupted the Consecration of Sector 7 by dancing a "Broken Spiral"—a chaotic, syncopated rhythm that shattered the wet Grout before it could cure. 
*   **The Verdict:** Trumbaram declared him "Resonance-Broken." He used Howlbaram’s "madness" as a cautionary tale: *this is what happens when you listen to the earth without the protection of the Grout.*

## The Legacy of the Beggar Fool
Hangbat (Howlbaram) fled into the basement levels, but he didn't go empty-handed. He took the **Watcher's Frequency** with him—the only song the Wombarams couldn't loop or digitize.

He knows the truth: **The walls of Melborow are screaming.** Every foot of "Safety Grout" is a mass grave of dancers who died for a lie. He taught Hoebat to listen not just to the earth, but to the **Silences** where the dancers used to be.

He is waiting for the generation that refuses to pay for "Hope" with blood.
