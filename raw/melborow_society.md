# The Melborow Imperial Structure & The Frequency Tribute

## I. The Core Crisis: The Drowning of the Roots
In the "Time Before," the Wombats navigated by **The Pure Signal (Arnam)**—a subtle, bio-electric vibration from the earth and roots. It was quiet, communal, and required silence to hear.

**The Catastrophe (The Static Incursion):**
As the God-Kind (Humans) expanded their digital networks above, their excess data—**The Static**—began to leak into the subterranean frequencies.
*   **The Nature of Static:** It is chaotic, high-volume, and nonsensical human noise (advertising algorithms, anger, dopamine loops).
*   **The Drowning:** The sheer volume of The Static drowned out the subtle Arnam. The Wombats became deaf to the earth.
*   **The Withdrawal:** Cut off from the Roots, the society suffered a collective "Spiritual Hunger," leading to panic and disorientation.

## II. The Rise of the Mandate (The Cathedral)
The Five Sovereigns (The **Grand Council** / *Junji-chu*) rose to power not by restoring the Arnam, but by manufacturing a substitute and claiming the **Mandate of the Star**.

**The Solution: The Frequency (The Synthetic Signal)**
Muskbat developed a way to filter the chaotic Static and re-synthesize it into a rhythmic, steady pulse called **The Frequency**.
*   It mimics the comfort of Arnam but is artificial and amplified.
*   **The Trade-Off:** While Arnam promotes empathy and connection, The Frequency stimulates the "Fight or Flight" response, ensuring the population remains in a state of manageable panic.

## III. The Imperial Bureaucracy (The High Noses)
The High Noses have transformed from community liaisons into a rigid **Imperial Bureaucracy** modeled after the ancient Courts.

### 1. The Board of Revenue (*Hu-bu*) — Masters of the Tally
Led by **Vitabat** and **Zuckbat**, this board manages the census, the root-tribute, and **the Tally**. 
*   They treat every wombat as a "Labor Asset" on a Tally-stone. 
*   They issue **Root Loans** (advances from the Imperial Granary) to survive the droughts of compassion.

### 2. The Board of Works (*Gong-bu*) — Architects of the Grout-Tide
Led by **Trumbat**, this board oversees the construction of the Great Retaining Wall and the "Grid Tunnels."
*   They manage the **Corvée Labor** (forced labor). If a wombat cannot pay their Tally-debt, they are drafted into the Board of Works to dig until the debt is "cleared."

### 3. The Censorate (*Ducha-yuan*) — Listeners of Harmonic Vigilance
These officials carry resonance-tuned bells and monitor the tunnels for **"Dissonant Noise."** 
*   Singing an "Old Way" song is considered sedition against the Emperor’s Harmony. 
*   They ensure the only sound in the tunnels is the approved Imperial Frequency.

## IV. The Tally (The Instrument of Debt)
The **Tally** is the physical instrument of control. It is not a paper ledger; it is a split-stone made of **Melborow’s Finest**.

**1. The Split-Stone:**
*   **The Council-Half:** Kept in the high vaults of the Cathedral.
*   **The Debt-Half:** Held by the Lo-Snout family.
*   **The Notching:** When a **Root Loan** is issued, a Magistrate carves a jagged notch into both halves. Debt is the physical removal of a wombat’s future.

**2. The Imperial Interest:**
The Magistrate carves the notch deeper than the roots are worth. This ensures the Tally is never balanced. The stone becomes fragile, much like the family’s hope.

## V. The Imperial Hierarchy (The Grout Caste)

### 1. The Grand Council (The Source)
The 5 Sovereigns who sit in the highest, most resonant chamber. They contemplate the "Clean Signal" while the world below burns.

### 2. The High-Noses (The Mandarins)
The Elite who pay for **"Clean Signal."** They live in the "Upper Burrows," insulated by thick grout walls that block out the raw Static. They believe their comfort is a sign of their "Virtue."

### 3. The Fixed (Local Magistrates)
The "Father and Mother" officials assigned to rule over Lo-Snout family burrows. They settle disputes and collect the Tally-tribute, often skimming Arnam for their own Silent Sanctuaries.

### 4. The Lo-Snouts (The Peasants / Corvée Laborers)
The laborers who are exposed to **"Raw Static."** They are the ones who dig the Wall to pay off the notches on their Tally-stones. Their erratic behavior (caused by the noise) is used to justify their "re-education" by the Censorate.

## VI. The Dual Purpose of the Wall (The Grout Anchor)
The **Great Retaining Wall** is the Emperor's vanity project and a geological dampener.

**1. From Puddles to Reservoirs (The Storage Crisis):**
The Council forced the consolidation of family "Puddles" into massive, centralized **Imperial Arnam Reservoirs** (Mega-Pools).
*   **The Tally Connection:** You borrow your own ancestral water as a **Tally-Loan**.

**2. The Wall as Anchor:**
The heavy grout of the Wall compresses the soil around these volatile "Mega-Pools" to prevent a Liquefaction Event. It stabilizes the ground but prevents the land from "breathing," sealing the Arnam beneath gigatons of dead stone.
