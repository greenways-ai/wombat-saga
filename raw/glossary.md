# Wombat Saga Glossary

*   **Arnam:** The "Wetness" or "Compassion" that binds the world together. The essential frequency of life. The opposite of the Dry/Static.
*   **Arnamland:** The name of the world/continent.
*   **Bad Grounds, The:** Areas of the surface that have been fully tiled by the Lattice (120-degree hexagonal prisms).
*   **Chorus, The (Spectrum Song):** The harmonic choir of the Rosellas that broadcast the health of the ecosystem. Formerly known as the Spectrum Song.
*   **Compassion Gaps:** Micro-fissures in the Crystal where organic life can still grip.
*   **Elen-Nico:** The central star hanging in the middle of the heart-void. It pulses with a "beat" (Day/Night cycle) determined by the emotional state of the Tall-Ones.
*   **Emus (The Shogunate):** The warring tribes of the Southern Shell. They follow a strict code of honor and isolation.
*   **Famine Protocol:** The extreme energy conservation (gliding/geometry) practiced by predators like Wedge-tailed Eagles in response to the collapse of the food chain.
*   **Frequency Void (Lusta Ómëa):** The highest atmospheric layer near Elen-Nico. A vacuum of pure resonance where feathers change color.
*   **Galahs (The Witnesses):** A bird species known for volume and stubbornness. They possess no specific "covenant" other than witnessing reality.
*   **Glass, The (The Outer Boundary):** The impenetrable, mirrored barrier 10km beneath the surface. The edge of the known world.
*   **Grout, The:** A synthetic, geometric substance poured into the substrate by wombats to seal the "Psychic Leak" from the Tall-Ones.
*   **HA (Mahatahto):** The second syllable of the Great Truth. Represents the Wombat Foundation (The Ground/The Paws).
*   **Heavy Breath, The (Thúlë Lunga):** The lowest atmospheric layer (0-10km). Thick, warm, moisture-rich.
*   **Hún Nico (The Heart of Nico):** The heart-shaped world where the saga takes place. It is a concave world ("The Inside").
*   **Jacaranda, The (The Transplant):** An invasive, pot-bound species that survives because its roots don't touch the poisoned deep substrate.
*   **Lattice, The:** The hexagonal crystalline structure replacing the organic world.
*   **Lattice Song, The:** The single, pure auditory frequency of the crystal. It seduced the Rosellas by sounding "already resolved."
*   **Law-Wind, The (Súrë Axan):** The middle atmospheric layer. Thin, cold, and orderly.
*   **MA (Mahatahto):** The first syllable of the Great Truth. Represents the Human Feed (The Dream/The Downward).
*   **Mahatahto:** The Three-Fold Truth (Symmetry) transmitted by the Jacaranda: MA, HA, TAHTO.
*   **Morning Glory (The Bearer):** A "Resource Parasite" weed that acted as the final vessel for the Wattle's memory.
*   **Noble Noise (Laica Róma):** The Galah scream. A form of emotional/structural echolocation.
*   **Rosellas (The Synthesis):** A bird species whose job was to braid all separate truths of the world into one Song.
*   **Spiral, The:** The non-repeating path Emus run to generate kinetic energy and claim territory.
*   **Substrate, The Deep:** The geological layer between the topsoil and the Glass. This is where the Lattice originates.
*   **TAHTO (Mahatahto):** The third syllable of the Great Truth. Represents the Dog Spirit (The Witness/The Float).
*   **Tall-Ones, The:** The giants (humans) who exist outside the Glass. Their emotions/dreams leak through as weather and light.
*   **Vector Sight:** The Eagle's ability to see future trajectories and probability cones as geometric lines.
*   **Wattle, The Great (Coring Tree):** The ancient giants whose taproots maintained the connection between the surface and the deep source.
*   **Wedge-tailed Eagles (The Sky-Logicians):** Predatory geometricians who view the sky as a series of calculable vectors.
*   **Wombats (The Builders):** The species responsible for the engineering of the substrate.
*   **Yellow Monsters:** Visual/emotional hallucinations of the Tall-Ones that appear when the Dreaming is too strong.

## Wombat Infrastructure Lexicon

### Tunnel Anatomy
*   **The Crown:** The ceiling or roof of a tunnel. A "sagging crown" indicates imminent collapse.
*   **The Springline:** The point where the curved crown meets the vertical sidewall. Critical for load distribution.
*   **The Invert:** The floor of a tunnel. Well-built tunnels have a "dished" (concave) invert to channel water.
*   **The Heading:** The working face of an excavation—the active digging front.
*   **The Bench:** The lower level of a tunnel, below the springline, where debris accumulates.

### Water Management
*   **The Sump:** A low point where water collects and is pumped out.
*   **The Weep:** Seepage through a tunnel wall—a warning sign of substrate saturation.
*   **The Seepage Wall:** A porous section allowing groundwater to enter slowly.
*   **The Relief Drain:** An emergency overflow channel (often capped by the Council).
*   **The Collection Sump:** A drainage basin for gathering water before pumping.
*   **Perimeter Redistribution:** Council euphemism for flooding poor districts.

### Council Infrastructure
*   **The Deep Sewer:** Council-bored transit tunnels lined with Safety Grout.
*   **The Sump Line:** The climate-controlled transit system in the Deep Sewer.
*   **The Service Chase:** A utility corridor running parallel to main tunnels.
*   **The Utility Conduit:** A channel carrying Frequency cables.
*   **Safety Grout:** The Council's synthetic concrete lining—cold and rigid.
*   **Yellow Monsters:** Human excavating machinery.

### Wombat Craft
*   **The Clay Pack:** Traditional method of sealing cracks using hand-worked clay.
*   **The Compassion Gap:** A micro-fissure left unfilled, allowing the tunnel to flex.
*   **The Hairline:** A surface crack—the first warning.
*   **The Fracture Line:** A deeper crack indicating structural stress.
*   **Dead Tissue:** A section of tunnel abandoned to decay.
