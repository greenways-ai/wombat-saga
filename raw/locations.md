# Locations of Arnamland

*For the complete topographical survey, see [[locations/the_world_map|The World Map]].*

The world of **Arnamland** is the inner surface of a heart-shaped sphere (Klein Bottle topology), curving inward toward the **Nico Star** at its center.

## 1. The Crown Region (Ríë Oira)
The "top" of the heart, closest to the Star.
*   **The Mountrich Perches:** Granite ridges where the Mountrich Kangaroos patrol.
*   **The Great Wattle:** The ancient Radiant Antenna (now fallen).
*   **The Eastern Ridge:** The front line of the schism. Home to the **Bad Grounds** (hexagonal lattice spreading down the slope).

## 2. The Eastern Shell (Rómen Pata)
*   **Melborow (Osto Tumba):** The central wombat metropolis, located underground beneath the Ridge.
    *   **The Cathedral:** The elite district (High-Noses).
    *   **The Gray Grotto:** The working-class district (Lo Snouts) in Brookborow. A warren of unlined tunnels with sagging crowns and weeping walls, currently being crushed between the Great Retaining Wall and the human skyscraper foundation above. The Council calls it "perimeter redistribution." The Lo Snouts call it drowning.
    *   **The Freeze Room:** Sub-Level 4, below grade. The server farm for the Liquid Ledger, housed in a climate-controlled vault with a dish-shaped invert to channel condensation.
*   **The Windbreak Cliffs:** Red sandstone cliffs, former Galah roosts.
*   **The Rosella Heights:** Abandoned rock outcrops, once the parliament of the Rosellas.

## 3. The Western Shell (Númen Pata)
*   **The Salt Pan:** A white, blinding expanse used by Dingoes for trading.
*   **The Dry Channels:** Ancient riverbeds following the Rainbow Serpent's spine.
*   **The Lone Borows:** Scattered dwellings of the "Hippie Wombats" and exiles.
*   **The Eucalyptus Groves:** The marginal zone where the **Jacaranda** grows.

## 4. The Southern Shell (Hyarmen Pata)
*   **The Crystal Plains:** The endgame. A vast expanse where the **Static** lattice has fully tiled the surface. Beautiful, perfect, and dead.
*   **The Shattered Gorge:** A geological fracture that the lattice cannot tile across. Training ground for **Kappa Mu**.
*   **The Closing Node:** The "bottom" tip of the heart-sphere where the world folds through itself. The crossing point to other worlds (like **Sydborow**).

## 5. The Atmospheric Strata (The Sky)
*   **The Heavy Breath (Thúlë Lunga):** The living air closest to the surface.
*   **The Law-Wind (Súrë Axan):** The high, patterned winds where the Emus glide.
*   **The Frequency Void (Lusta Ómëa):** The near-vacuum surrounding the Nico Star, where the "Noble Noise" resonates best.

## 6. The Deep Underground
*   **The Root Cathedral:** Ancient ceremonial chamber shaped by Coring Tree roots, not paws. Its crown is living wood, its invert packed with resonant clay.
*   **The Static-Pits:** Pools of concentrated geometric frequency where the substrate has fully crystallized.
*   **The Grid Tunnels:** The new Council infrastructure—straight-line passages poured in **Safety Grout**, lacking springline curvature, prone to shear failure.
*   **The Deep Sewer:** Council-bored transit tunnels lined with Grout, running below grade. Home to the **Sump Line** transit system.
*   **The Seep-bed:** The last natural aquifer beneath the Gray Grotto, threatened by the Great Retaining Wall. Its weep keeps the unlined tunnels alive.
*   **The Service Chase:** Utility corridors running parallel to main tunnels, housing the Frequency conduits and weep lines.
*   **The Collection Sumps:** Drainage basins designed to gather groundwater before pumping—now clogged with silt in the peripheral borows.
*   **The Relief Drains:** Emergency overflow channels (capped by the Council to make room for utility conduits).

## 6. The Human World ("The Above")
*   **The Tall-Ones' Sky:** The external reality. Invisible to wombats, but its weight (skyscrapers, excavators) is felt as "Natural Disasters."
