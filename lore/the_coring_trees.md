# The Coring Trees (Alda Tumba)

**"A tree that drinks from the bottom holds up the sky—and reaches for the Heart next door."**
— *Ancient Galah Proverb (Full version)*

The Coring Trees are the "Pillars of the World." In the heart-shaped topology of Hún Nico, they are the only biological entities that connect the **Surface** to the **Deep Source** (10km down) and beyond.

## The Function: The Vertical Anchor
Unlike the wide-rooted flora (like the Jacaranda), a Coring Tree sends a single, massive taproot straight down through the substrate.
*   **The Connection:** The taproot bypasses the soil layers to drink directly from the **Deep Aquifer** (The Source Water) located just above the Glass boundary.
*   **The Transmission:** They act as "Coaxial Cables," pulling raw Arnam (empathy-energy) from the deep source and radiating it out through their canopy to nourish the local colony.
*   **Structural Support:** They physically pin the organic soil layer to the deep crystalline substrate. Their presence prevents the "Structural Rigidity" of the Static from surfacing.

## The Secret Function: The Root Bridges
The true importance of the Coring Trees lies in their role as **Inter-World Conduits**. 
*   **Topological Breaching:** In the time before the Static, the taproots of the greatest Coring Trees did not stop at the Deep Aquifer. They were designed to push through the **Closing Node** (The Fold) and emerge into the substrate of an adjacent Heart-World.
*   **The Network:** This created a physical, biological bridge between worlds. Nutrients, information, and even tiny travelers could pass along the surface of these "World-Roots," linking the many breaths of the God-Kind into a single, living forest.
*   **The Wombat Monopoly:** Only the Wombats knew this. As the **Substrate-Natives**, they were the only species capable of traversing these deep root-bridges. They traveled between worlds, sharing architectural secrets, soil recipes, and cultural wisdom with the Wombat Guilds of other Hearts. This "Inter-World Sharing" is the source of the Wombats' immense historical knowledge and technical skill—they didn't invent it all in one hole; they aggregated it from a thousand worlds.

## The Five Pillars of Hún Nico
In the Glory Days, there were exactly five great Coring Trees, corresponding to the key pressure points of the heart-shape.

| Tree Name | Species | Location | Status | History / Cause of Fall |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Malinalda Arata** | Golden Wattle | **The Crown** (The Inner Apex) | **SHATTERED** | The King Tree. Shattered generations ago. Its taproot was the primary bridge to the Crown of the next world. |
| **2. Carnialda** | River Red Gum | **The Western Shell** (Dry Channels) | **DEAD** | Standing but hollow. Its bridge to Sydborow is severed and dry. |
| **3. Sinda-Taurë** | Ironbark | **The Southern Shell** (Emu Steppe) | **CALCIFIED** | Turned entirely to stone. The bridge it once held is now a solid, cold plug of crystal. |
| **4. Nén-Alda** | Paperbark | **The Gorge** (The Waist) | **MISSING** | Swallowed by the earth. Its inter-world root was likely snapped during the Rending of Stone. |
| **5. The Silver Wattle** | Silver Wattle | **The Eastern Ridge** | **SHATTERED** | The "Last Prince." Shattered recently. It was the final tree attempting to hold a bridge open to the neighboring Heart. |

## The Vertical Failure
The Wombats' failure to protect these trees stemmed from a theological error: they believed that as long as the taproot was deep, the tree was safe. They did not realize that the **Static** was rising from the bottom up. By reinforcing the deep roots, the Wombats unknowingly created a direct conduit for the crystalline poison to reach the heart of the trees and, more catastrophically, to cross the bridges into other worlds.

The shattering of the **Silver Wattle** marks the end of the Age of Verticality and the final severing of the natural inter-world bridges.
