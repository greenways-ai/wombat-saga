# The Wallaby Network (The Social Graph)

**"A signal that doesn't move is just noise. Pass it on."**

The **Wallaby Network** represents the Fourth Thread (**Integration**). They are the messengers, the gossips, and the nervous system of Greater Arnam.

## The Philosophy of the Hop-Link

The Wallabies believe that **Isolation is Death**. A single animal is vulnerable; a connected network is invincible.

*   **The Graph:** They view the forest not as trees and rocks, but as a "Graph of Relations." Every animal is a node, and the Wallabies are the packets of data moving between them.
*   **The Mirroring:** They practice "Radical Empathy." A Wallaby does not just listen to you; they *become* you for the duration of the conversation. They mirror your posture, your twitch, and your fear to ensure the data transfer is lossless.

## The Practice: The Relay

The Wallaby practice is kinetic and social. They are never still, for a stopped Wallaby is a dropped packet.

*   **The Thump-Code:** They communicate through a complex language of foot-thumps that vibrates through the ground. A single "Thump" can carry a warning, a joke, or a coordinate, depending on the frequency.
*   **The Panic-Flash:** When a threat is detected, the Wallabies execute the "Panic-Flash"—a synchronized scatter pattern that confuses predators and uploads the threat data to every node in the vicinity instantly.

## Role in Greater Arnam

The Wallaby Network serves as the **Internet Service Providers** and **Union Representatives**.

*   **The Connectors:** If the Emu (Systems Logic) needs to talk to the Wombat (Hardware), they send a Wallaby. The Emu speaks "Map," the Wombat speaks "Mud," and the Wallaby speaks both.
*   **The Early Warning System:** They are the first to know when the water is drying up or when the High-Noses are planning a clearing.
*   **The Gluestick:** They hold the "Social Fabric" together. They organize the gatherings, spread the rumors that enforce social norms, and ensure that no one is truly alone (even if they want to be).
