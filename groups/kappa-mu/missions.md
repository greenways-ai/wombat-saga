## Mission History

### 1. Operation "Shattered Gorge" (Training / COMPLETED)
**Objective:** Navigate the Gorge without sight using the **[[../../lore#The Threads (The Sutras)|Ninth Thread]]** (Systems Logic).
**Result:** Squad passed. Bond forged. Oath sworn.
**Tactical Note:** This trial established the cross-species sensing protocol — Pokero on vibration/intent, Cooroo on aerial echo-return, Merl on substrate mapping, Bash on comms relay, Hoebat on structural analysis. The protocol remains our primary operational framework.

### 2. Operation "Silent Architecture" (Maintenance / COMPROMISED)
**Objective:** Conduct covert structural repairs across Gray Grotto Sectors 7-12 using Old Way clay-pack techniques to prevent cascade failure.
**Duration:** Three years continuous.
**Status:** COMPROMISED as of Day One of the Wall. The Great Retaining Wall foundation trench has severed four of eleven major repair connections. Zuckbat's ledger analysis has identified the "Ghost Capital" surplus. He has maintained a surveillance gap over our operations but his cooperation is conditional and unguaranteed. Parrin's engineering report has flagged the unauthorized modifications to Trumbat.
**Tactical Note:** The repairs remain the only thing preventing immediate structural collapse of Sectors 7-12. Their exposure does not change this fact.

### 3. Operation "Cloud-Break" (Infiltration / PENDING)
**Objective:** Infiltrate and dismantle the Koala-run Eucalyptus Lab to sever the supply chain of synthetic "Liquid Asset."
**Status:** PENDING — deferred due to Wall crisis. Lab remains operational. Muskbat continues to source synthetic Arnam from Koala refiners.
**Tactical Note:** Cloud-Break is strategically important but not time-critical. The Wall is both.

## Current Mission: Operation "Soft Ground"

**Objective:** Prevent the Great Retaining Wall of The Grout from triggering cascade structural failure across the Gray Grotto.

### Phase 1: REPAIR-AHEAD (In Progress)
**Lead:** Hoebat.
**Task:** Reinforce remaining repair connections ahead of the pour. Build redundant load-distribution web using accelerated clay-pack technique.
**Status:** Seven of eleven connections intact. Material supply from seep-bed at 30% reserve. Pace is insufficient — the pour is advancing faster than the repairs.

### Phase 2: PARALLEL TRACK (In Progress)
**Lead:** Pokero.
**Task:** Direct community engagement with Lo Snout workers. Establish trust through presence, not rhetoric. Undermine Trumbat's "Dingo threat" narrative through sustained, non-threatening proximity.
**Status:** Initial contact made at Sector 10 worker's camp. Children engaged. Adult workers observing but not hostile. The mirror is working. Slowly.

### Phase 3: SIGNAL INTERCEPT (In Progress)
**Lead:** Bash.
**Task:** Monitor Council comms for pour schedule changes, inspection orders, and threat assessments. Exploit buffer overflow in Muskbat's encryption codec. Relay intercepts to squad via root-network vibration code.
**Status:** Full intercept capability. Critical intelligence obtained — Trumbat has ordered accelerated pour despite engineering recommendation to halt. The Council knows the wall will damage the repairs. They are pouring anyway.

### Phase 4: CONTINGENCY (Standby)
**Lead:** Hoebat (all squad).
**Task:** If repair-ahead fails and cascade failure becomes imminent — full exposure. The ghost steps forward. Hoebat reveals the repairs to the Lo Snout population and physically opens the wall at the fracture point to enable evacuation.
**Status:** STANDBY. Trigger condition: imminent cascade failure confirmed by Merl's substrate readings and Cooroo's aerial harmonics.

## Threat Assessment: The Five-I's Sovereign Council

| Sovereign | Element | Threat Level | Assessment |
|-----------|---------|-------------|------------|
| [[../../characters/antagonists#Trumbat (The Priest)|Trumbat]] | Earth | CRITICAL | The Priest. Driving the wall. Will not stop. Interprets structural data through political lens. Declared unauthorized repairs "sabotage." Will order Vitabat to "collect" us if squad is exposed. |
| [[../../characters/antagonists#Muskbat (The Tech/Batman)|Muskbat]] | Fire | MODERATE | Tech/Batman. Focused on minting the wall as a PR asset. His Frequency broadcast is the primary tool keeping Lo Snouts compliant. Vulnerable if Frequency is jammed. Not directly hostile — hostile by omission. Retreating into abstraction. |
| [[../../characters/antagonists#Tatebat (The Pimp)|Tatebat]] | Metal | VARIABLE | The Pimp. Runs the Glow Room — "Drip Seminars" that sell young wombats a gilded cage. His stable of influencers controls the visual culture of the Grotto. However: Tatebat has NOT reported the Ghost repair found in his Glow Room wall. His ceiling depends on it. Potential fracture point in Council unity. Wants to "rebrand" the Resistance, not destroy it. |
| [[../../characters/antagonists#Vitabat (The Enforcer)|Vitabat]] | Water | HIGH | The Enforcer. Collection arm. Kevlar-weave suit, scarred paws, cold violence. His audit with Zuckbat confirmed the Ghost Capital is structurally beneficial. However: Trumbat's orders override his pragmatism. When told to collect, he collects. Will pursue the squad on Trumbat's command. |
| [[../../characters/antagonists#Zuckbat (The Ledger)|Zuckbat]] | Wood | VARIABLE | The Ledger. Merged surveillance and financial records into a single panopticon. Has maintained surveillance gap over our operations for eleven months. His dependency graph says we are infrastructure. Knows the squad is five members, not one. May protect us from self-interest, but Zuckbat's loyalty is to Zuckbat's network. If the cost-benefit shifts, he will sacrifice us without hesitation. |
