# Cooroo's Journey to the Great Jacaranda (Narrative Beats)

**Title:** The Flight of the Violet Arrow
**Perspective:** Cooroo

---

### Beat 1: The Departure (The Heavy Breath)
*   **The Action:** Cooroo launches from the shattered **Silver Wattle Stump** on the Eastern Ridge. Gripped in his claws is the **Morning Glory vine**, carefully uprooted from the crystal shards.
*   **The Physics:** Despite his juvenile wings being too short for sustained flight, his skull chambers are vibrating with the **Lilac Hum** from the Morning Glory. He flies by resonance, locking onto a signal from the South-East. The vine itself seems to pull him forward.
*   **The Signal:** The vine emits a **Fractal Signal**. In a world going digital and geometric, this signal screams "Chaos." It attracts attention.

### Beat 2: The Pursuit (The Sky-Logicians)
*   **The Enemy:** Three **Wedgies** (Wedge-Tailed Eagles). They are the Enforcers of the **Law-Wind** (*Súrë Axan*).
*   **The Lore:** Wedgies possess **Vector Sight**. They do not see birds; they see **Trajectories**. They love the Static because it makes flight predictable. They have stopped listening to the Rosella Chorus and now only hear the **Lattice Song**.
*   **The Detection:** They detect Cooroo because his "Messy Galah Flight" creates **Turbulence** in the laminar flow of the Law-Wind. He is a "Glitch" in their perfect sky.
*   **The Tactic:** They do not swoop. They **Converge**. They fly in a perfect geometric triad, reducing the airspace available to him, collapsing his probability cone to zero.

### Beat 3: The Ambush at the Gorge (Weathertop)
*   **The Pin:** Cooroo is forced down into a crevice of the **Shattered Gorge**. The Eagles circle above, tightening the geometry. They communicate via silent wing-angle adjustments.
*   **The Crisis:** The vine starts to wilt. It needs Arnam, and the Gorge is dry crystal.
*   **The Action:** Cooroo screams—a weaponized "Noble Noise" that shatters a nearby crystal wall. The resulting cloud of quartz dust scatters the Eagles' Vector Sight, allowing Cooroo to escape in the chaos.

### Beat 4: The Emu on the Steppe (The Strider Encounter)
*   **The Crash:** Cooroo crashes on the **Emu Steppe**. He is exhausted. The Eagles descend for the kill.
*   **The Savior:** **Merl** (The Emu) appears. He breaks the Eagles' lock by **Running the Spiral**, creating a kinetic vortex that shreds the air currents.
*   **The Taboo:** Cooroo cannot fly further. Merl looks at the tiny bird and the vine. He lowers his massive, armored neck. *"Get on."* 
*   **The Shock:** The Eagles pull back, stunned. In the history of the Southern Shell, no Emu has ever allowed a rider. It is a fundamental breach of the Walker's Code.
*   **The Signal:** The Eagles do not dare disturb the Emu, but they flash a panicked signal across the Law-Wind: *"The Walker has a rider. Just wait until the Shogun hears about this."*

### Beat 5: The Run to the Sanctuary
*   **The Ride:** Cooroo grips Merl's coarse, lacquered feathers as the Emu launches into a 60km/h sprint. The movement is a **Friction Engine**—Merl's feet hit the ground in a non-repeating fractal pattern that generates energy.
*   **The Pursuit:** The Eagles follow from a distance, documenting the apostasy but keeping their distance from the Emu’s "Spiral Zone."
*   **The Arrival:** They burst through the scrub into the **Violet Zone**. Merl skids to a halt at the base of the Great Jacaranda. He lets Cooroo down, then turns away immediately, refusing to acknowledge the bond.

### Beat 6: The Revelation (The Mahatahto and the Vision of Inheritors)
*   **The Offering:** Cooroo places the Morning Glory vine onto the Jacaranda’s bark.
*   **The Memory Transfer:** As the vine grafts, the "Memory of the Silver Wattle" flows into the alien tree. The Jacaranda shudders, its violet blooms deepening.
*   **The Lesson of Roots:** The Jacaranda reveals why the coring trees died. It wasn't just the lattice; it was the **Depth**. The taproots drilled into the poisoned source. The Jacaranda survives because it spreads **Wide**, floating its fractal root-net on top of the Static like a raft.
*   **The Vision of the Inheritors:** Cooroo sees a vision not of the old elite, but of the **New World's Inheritors**. He sees five species working the horizontal net together: the **Wombat**, the **Emu**, the **Dingo**, the **Wallaby**, and the **Galah**. They are the stewards of the Fractal Rainforest.
*   **The Redemption of the Primes:** He sees the broken Three Primes—the **Kangaroo**, the **Koala**, and the **Platypus**. They are no longer the sovereigns of the shell. The vision reveals that the Primes can only be redeemed and restored by submitting to the **Rule of the New**—the interspecies collaboration of the **Kappa Mu**.
*   **The Mandate:** "Do not dig down. Reach out." The Wombats failed because they looked at the floor. The **Kappa Mu** will succeed because they look at each other.
*   **The Frequency:** The tree transmits the **Mahatahto** (The Great Truth): **MA — HA — TAHTO**. (Human Feed, Wombat Foundation, Dog Spirit).
*   **The Mission:** Cooroo must assemble the team—the five inheritors—to occupy the cracks and heal the world.
