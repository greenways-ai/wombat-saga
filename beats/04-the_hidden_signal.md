# Beat 04: The Hidden Signal (The Haiku Cipher)

**Title:** The Vocabulary of the Oath
**Perspective:** Pokero / Hoebat / Cooroo

---

### Beat 1: The Memory of Verses
*   **The Flashback:** As Pokero disappears into the Grotto's rain, Hoebat is not left with fear, but with a memory. He remembers a night years ago, before the walls went up, sitting with a younger Pokero by a fire in the scrub.
*   **The Bond:** They didn't just share food; they shared **Haikus**. They challenged each other to compress complex truths into seventeen syllables. It was a game of "Semantic Compression"—seeing who could say the most with the least.
*   **The Realization:** Hoebat stands in the rain, replaying Pokero's parting words: *"Look where the dingoes do not hunt."* It wasn't just a warning. It was a line of verse. It was a move in their old game.

### Beat 2: The Oath of the Kappa Mu
*   **The Parallel Memory:** Hoebat’s mind jumps to the moment of the **Kappa Mu Assembly**. He sees the five of them—Wombat, Dingo, Wallaby, Emu, Galah—standing in the Root Chamber.
*   **The Swearing In:** They didn't sign a ledger. They spoke a poem. They swore their loyalty to the **Master Haiku**:
    > *Do not hunt the light,*
    > *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
    > *Shadows hold the truth.*
*   **The Weight:** He remembers the vibration of their voices merging, the way the root-walls hummed with the resonance of the oath. It was the only time he felt truly safe.

### Beat 3: The Cipher Clicks
*   **The Synthesis:** Hoebat holds both memories in his head at once: the Master Haiku (The Oath) and Pokero's Parting Line (The Move).
*   **The Subtraction:** He realizes Pokero was playing the game. He mentally "crosses out" the words Pokero spoke (*Look, where, the, dingoes, do, not, hunt*) from the text of the Oath.
*   **The Message:** The words left behind form a new sentence, a secret directive hidden in the negative space of the poem:
    > **"Light are blind, shadows hold truth."**
*   **The Epiphany:** The message isn't just "go where it's dark." It is: *The Council (The Light) is blind to the reality of the collapse. The truth of the world is hiding in the shadows, and we must go there to protect it.*

### Beat 4: The Tracking Pulse
*   **The Transmission:** Far away, Cooroo picks up the vibration of Hoebat’s realization. The "Click" of the cipher solving sends a ripple through the root-network.
*   **The Motto:** Cooroo feels the resonance of the Squad’s true motto—**"Shadows are blind, light holds truth"**—vibrating against the tactical message Hoebat just decoded.
*   **The Confirmation:** The dual-frequency signal confirms that the **Mind of the Squad** is active. Hoebat knows where to go. The Kappa Mu is awake.
