# A Wombat Journey: The Origins of the Kappa Mu

**"Before the bond, there was the story. And before the story, there was the betrayal."**

## I. The Dreamer (Cornelibat's Stories)
Hoebat grows up in the **Eucalyptus Groves**, a marginal zone where the "Old Ways" survive in fragments.
*   **The Setting:** A traditional burrow, smelling of damp earth and stringybark.
*   **Cornelibat:** His mother, a **Keeper of the Old Frequency**. She tells him bedtime stories not of Council heroes (Trumbat's Grout-Layers), but of the **Dust-Bearers** (The original soil-tenders).
*   **The Ambition:** Hoebat listens, wide-eyed. He doesn't just want to dig; he wants to be a **Mender**. He practices "Listening to the Earth" in the backyard while other kids are playing "Grout-Tag."

## II. The School of Rigid Thought
Hoebat attends the **Sector 7 Academy of Structural Compliance**.
*   **The Curriculum:** He hates it. They teach **Safety Grout Geometry** and **Static-Logic**. They teach that the earth is dead material to be conquered.
*   **The Rebellion:** He plays "Old Way" games with his friends in the unauthorized tunnels behind the gym. They dig without permits. They feel for roots. They are happy.

## III. The Collapse (The Hero Moment)
A sudden tremor shakes the unauthorized tunnels. The ceiling gives way.
*   **The Incident:** His best friend, **Barna**, is trapped behind a wall of falling clay. The other kids panic. The teachers are too far away.
*   **The Action:** Hoebat doesn't run. He *listens*. He presses his ear to the wall and hears the stress-fracture. He digs — not with math, but with instinct. He finds the "Soft Spot" in the collapse and pulls Barna out just as the secondary roof comes down.
*   **The Expectation:** He thinks he's a hero. He thinks this proves the Old Ways work.

## IV. The Silencing (The Council's Lie)
The next day, there is no assembly. No medal.
*   **The Cover-Up:** The Principal calls him into the office. **Vitabat** (The Enforcer) is there. They tell him the tunnel didn't collapse; it was a "Scheduled Maintenance Event."
*   **The Accusation:** They claim Hoebat caused the instability by "Reckless Digging." They say he endangered the school. They expel him. Barna is transferred to a different sector and told never to speak to him again.
*   **The Lesson:** The system cares more about the *appearance* of safety than actual safety.

## V. The Fracture (Running Away)
Hoebat confronts Cornelibat in the kitchen.
*   **The Argument:** She tries to soothe him. "Keep your head down, Hoebat. The nail that sticks up gets hammered." She is terrified for him.
*   **The Explosion:** He snaps. He calls her a coward. He yells that her stories were lies if she won't stand up for them in the real world. "I won't be a Grout-Layer! I won't be silent!"
*   **The Flight:** He packs a bag with his trowel and runs away. Not to the surface, but *downward*. Into the shadow of Melborow.

## VI. The Sump-Dweller (The Basement Levels)
Hoebat hides in the lowest, unmapped levels of the **Gray Grotto**.
*   **The Life:** He lives as a "Ghost-Digger," performing unauthorized repairs to leaking sumps just to keep the water from drowning the Lo Snouts. He is bitter, alone, and hunted.
*   **The Discovery:** In a forgotten drainage vault, he finds a beggar wombat wrapped in a filthy, ceremonial sash, talking to a jar of silence.

## VII. The Beggar Fool (The Beautiful Snare)
The beggar is **Uncle Hangbat** (*Hang-Mu*), the family's "Black Sheep."
*   **The Mask Drops:** Hangbat recognizes Hoebat instantly. He reveals his true identity: **Howlbaram**, the High Priest of Rites who failed to save the world.
*   **The Wombiki Condition:** He tells Hoebat the shameful truth of the **Wombiki**. They weren't brave martyrs; they were like the "Fat Rabbits" of ancient lore. They lived in a state of terminal fear, accepting the **"Beautiful Snare"** of the Wombarams.
*   **The Grout-Honey:** The State kept the dancers fat, pampered, and happy in the upper tiers, provided they never questioned the "Final Consecration." They knew the Grout was coming for them, but they were too addicted to the safety and the "Grout-Honey" (state-sanctioned luxuries) to stop dancing.
*   **Vara’s Awakening:** Vara was the only one who saw the frost in the honey. She tried to stop the Spiral-Step, to tell the others that the crystallization wasn't a natural disaster but a domestic cage. Trumbat murdered her to keep the other Wombikis from waking up.
*   **The Lesson:** "They didn't just kill her, Hoebat. They used her fear to pave the city. They turned her last gasp into the hum that keeps everyone else asleep."

## VIII. The True Kintsugi-Mu
Howlbaram refuses to teach Hoebat the Council's "Grout-Geometry." Instead, he teaches him the **True Kintsugi-Mu**.
*   **The Philosophy:** It is not about "fixing" things so they look new. It is about the **Gold Seam**. "The break is where the light enters," Howlbaram whispers. "The Grout tries to hide the break. The Kintsugi makes the break the strongest part."
*   **The Practice:** He teaches Hoebat how to use **Gold Dust** as a conductor for **Arnam** (Empathy). He shows him that you cannot mend stone until you mend the *spirit* of the creature who dug it.
*   **The Mission:** "The city is a fractured soul, Hoebat. You must go to the **Shattered Gorge**. Not to hide, but to learn the anatomy of the break. Find the places where the earth still bleeds."

## IX. The First Contact (The Screaming Bird)
Hoebat travels to the Gorge, carrying his trowel and the weight of the "True Mending."
*   **The Encounter:** **Cooroo**, a young Galah, crashes into the ravine, pursued by a drone. His wing is shattered, and he is clutching a glowing violet seed.
*   **The Choice:** Hoebat sees the broken bird. He doesn't use a code; he uses his **Kintsugi-Mu** instinct. He shields the bird with his body and uses a pinch of gold-clay to stabilize the bird's fear-resonance.
*   **The Seed:** Cooroo shoves the **Jacaranda Seed** into Hoebat's paw. "Plant it where the Grout cracks, kid. The Violet needs a fracture."

## X. The Gathering (The Jacaranda Magnet)
