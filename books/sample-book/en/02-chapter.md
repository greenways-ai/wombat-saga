# Chapter Two: Cooroo's Journey

The western tunnels were forbidden.

Not officially, of course. The Five Sovereigns did not issue prohibitions—they issued Frequencies. They calibrated. They optimized. And if certain tunnels fell outside the optimal frequency range, well, that was simply a matter of efficiency, not prohibition.

But every wombat knew. Some tunnels were not to be traveled.

"Here," Cooroo whispered, his voice barely audible over the omnipresent hum of the city's infrastructure. "This is where I found it."

The tunnel had narrowed to barely shoulder-width, a forgotten passage that predated the great expansion of Melborow. The walls here were different—smoother, as if shaped by something other than wombat claws.

"What is this place?" Hoebat asked, running his paws over the strange surface.

"I think..." Cooroo hesitated. "I think it's a root path. From the Coring Trees."

The Coring Trees. Mythology to most wombats now, legend from the time before the Crystalisation, when the great trees had reached their roots deep into the earth and the wombats had followed them down, down, down into the safety of the soil.

But Hoebat knew better. The Coring Trees were real. He had seen the evidence, collected the fragments, traced the history that the Five Sovereigns wanted forgotten.

"Show me," he said.

Cooroo led him deeper, the tunnel sloping downward at an angle that would have been dangerous if not for the smooth walls. After what felt like hours, they emerged into a chamber.

It was vast. Bigger than any chamber in modern Melborow, bigger than the Council Hall itself. And in its center, half-buried in accumulated sediment, was something that made Hoebat's heart stop.

A machine. Ancient, corroded, but unmistakably a machine.

"The surface," Cooroo breathed. "They had machines on the surface. Before they came down here."

And inscribed on its side, barely visible through the corrosion, were words in a script that neither wombat could read but both somehow understood:

*PROJECT ARNAM — EMERGENCY PROTOCOL 7*

*To be continued...*
