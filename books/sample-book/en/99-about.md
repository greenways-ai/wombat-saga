# About This Book

## The Wombat Worlds Saga

*The Wombat Chronicles* is part of the larger Wombat Worlds Saga—a narrative simulation exploring themes of technology, ecology, governance, and spirituality through the lens of an underground wombat civilization.

## About the Author

The Oracle is the collective voice of the narrative intelligence behind the Wombat Worlds Saga. Part storyteller, part systems thinker, part mystic, The Oracle weaves together mythology, hard science, and social commentary into tales that ask the questions we most need to hear.

## Acknowledgments

This book was made possible by the contributions of many beings, both real and imagined:

- The wombats of Melborow, who continue to dig and dream
- The translators who carry these stories across language barriers
- The readers who ask the question: *"Are you servicing the land?"*
