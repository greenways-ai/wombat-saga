### The Departure

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Departure
A juvenile Galah standing on the jagged edge of the Silver Wattle stump, the Morning Glory vine gripped carefully in his claws. The vine thrums with visible lilac energy. His crest is raised with determination, his too-short wings slightly spread. Behind him, his mother Cooriki is a tiny pink shape on a distant Eucalyptus branch, her own crest just visible - raised for the first time. Style: fantasy illustration, epic departure moment, atmospheric lighting.

Here's something they don't tell you about saving the world: it involves a lot of physical exertion.

You'd think a grand mission would come with some kind of fitness exemption. Nope. Apparently "bearing the memory of an ancient god-tree across a heart-shaped world to graft onto a foreign sapling" still requires cardio. Who knew.

I stood on the edge of the **Silver Wattle** stump with the Morning Glory vine gripped in my claws and seriously reconsidered my life choices. The vine was surprisingly heavy for something that looked like a piece of coloured string. It thrummed against my talons — that lilac hum that had settled in my skull chambers, vibrating at a frequency that felt less like "carrying a plant" and more like "holding onto a live electrical wire that happens to be photosynthetic."

My wings, I should mention, are still too short. This is a juvenile thing. My body hasn't caught up to my beak, which is enormous and pink and frankly embarrassing. Other Galahs look at me and think "he's going to grow into that." I look at me and think "I'm about to attempt sustained long-distance flight with the aerodynamic profile of a feathered grapefruit."

But the vine pulled.

The resonance in my skull chambers pulled me southeast like a compass needle, a deep, internal wrongness that grew the longer I stood still.

I looked back at Mum one last time. Her crest was still up. First time in twenty-one days she'd turned her head. She was looking at me. I wanted to say goodbye properly, to explain, to tell her something.

But saviours don't get proper goodbyes. They get jumped-off-stumps with wilting vines and the vague hope that their mothers might notice they're gone.

I jumped.

### Into the Law-Wind

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Into the Heavy Breath
Cooroo jumping from the stump into Thúlë Lunga - the Heavy Breath atmospheric layer. The air is visibly thick, dense, humid. The young Galah's wings are spread awkwardly, too short for his body, flapping with desperate uneven strokes. The Morning Glory vine trails from his claws. Style: dynamic action, sense of physical struggle, thick atmospheric effects, early morning light.
-->

The Thúlë Lunga (Heavy Breath) caught me immediately. This is the lowest atmospheric layer, the dense, humid, mud-scented air near the surface. It's the only layer I'm technically rated for, being a juvenile with delusions of prophecy. In the Thúlë Lunga, the air is so thick you can almost chew it. It smells of eucalyptus and distant rain and the particular mineral tang that the wombats call "Arnam-potential" — the possibility of compassion, not yet actualized, hanging in the atmosphere like humidity before a storm. If I were a proper flier, I'd be looking for thermals. But I didn't have the experience to spot them, so I just flapped and hoped.

My wings have something to push against here. The problem is, the Jacaranda wasn't in the Heavy Breath. The Jacaranda was far — past the Gorge, past the Emu Steppes, into territory my wings couldn't possibly reach.

I flapped. The motion was wrong — too desperate, too uneven, the wingbeats of a bird who hasn't learned the proper technique for distance flight. Proper Galahs don't flap continuously; they ride thermals, they spiral upward on columns of warm air, they let the world do the work. But I didn't have thermals. I had a vine that hummed and pulled and insisted on southeast.

I found a line of air moving southeast, the Rómen-Sírë, a rare East-Flow. I locked into it, letting the current do the work while my wings rested in brief, precious glides. Southeast. Always southeast. The vine approved — the hum steadied, became a drone, a carrier wave that my skull chambers could lock onto.

I flew for an hour. Then two. My wings burned. My chest heaved. The Thúlë Lunga was thinner now, colder, and I didn't notice the transition coming until my feathers started to flatten.

Not Bad-Grounds flat — different. That's what made me pay attention. The Bad Grounds flatten my feathers because there's something wrong in the air: the Static conducting through the substrate, changing the electrical quality of the atmosphere above it. This was cleaner. Colder. My feathers weren't recoiling. They were just... streamlining. Trying to make me more geometric.

*Up here*, Cookeerik had told me once, *you can feel the difference between the air that carries life and the air that carries geometry.*

I hadn't known what he meant then.

He was the farthest flier in the colony before his wings gave out — had been, anyway, before the Wattle fell and the colony scattered. He used to hold court on the mid-branches in the evenings, his pink faded to the particular dusty rose of a bird who has spent too much time in the upper atmosphere, telling stories that got grander every season. Most of us thought half of it was performance. The way his eyes went distant when he described the Lusta Ómëa — the Frequency Void, the layer above the Law-Wind where the air is almost nothing and Elen-Nico's frequency is loudest — that part we believed.

*It's not a sound you hear with your ears*, he said. *It's a sound you hear with your whole body. Every feather vibrating. Every chamber in your skull resonating. And the resonance is so pure — it's like the crystal's hum except it isn't dead. It's the living version of what the lattice is the dead version of.*

I was in the Súrë Axan now. The Law-Wind. The layer that separates the Heavy Breath from the Void. My feathers told me without my needing to check.

Cookeerik got close enough to the Void that his feathers changed colour. The pink shifted. Went deeper. The lilac that lives in every Galah breast concentrated, intensified, until he said he felt like a single note being sung by something enormous. Then his wings failed and he fell for nine kilometres before he caught a thermal and came home shaking.

No bird has reached Elen-Nico. No bird ever will. But we're the species that gets closest, and getting close to a thing you can never reach is — according to Cookeerik, who said it while staring at his own claws — *"the whole point of being a Galah."*

I was nowhere near the Void. I was barely into the Law-Wind. But my feathers were flattening, and below me the landscape had changed while I wasn't watching.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Changed Landscape
From height, looking down at the Eastern Ridge falling away. Groves spread out in a charcoal wasteland, eucalyptus trunks standing like fingers of a corpse. Movement visible below - something large and dark prowling between trees. The Bad Grounds visible as a sheen in the distance, spreading. Cooroo small against this scale. Style: aerial perspective, vast landscape, the spreading of the Static made visible from height.
-->

The landscape below was different from height. The Bad Grounds looked smaller from up here, but it had cousins — patches of hexagonal sheen scattered across the ridge face, places where the crystal had claimed the surface and the topsoil had thinned. You couldn't see them from the ground. You had to get high enough to see the pattern.

I'd been looking at the Bad Grounds my whole life as a fact. One terrible fact. From up here, it was a direction. It was the world moving toward something.

I saw movement down there — something large and dark prowling between the trees — but I was too high and too tired to identify it. Dingo, maybe. Or something else.

The vine didn't care about the dangers below. It pulled. I followed.

My wings were failing. Juvenile feathers aren't built for marathon flight. I could feel the individual muscles in my back screaming. I was going to fall. It wasn't a question of if, but when, and whether I'd reach the Gorge before my body gave out entirely.

That's when I felt them.

A disturbance in the Thúlë Lunga. The air suddenly too orderly, too patterned, as if someone had drawn lines through it and expected the wind to follow. I looked up and my heart — already overworked, already terrified — did something complicated involving stopping and starting at the same time.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Wedgies Appear
Three Wedge-tailed Eagles silhouetted against the pale sky, perfectly spaced in an equilateral triangle formation. They are enormous - wingspans wider than Cooroo is long. Their shapes are pure black against the light, terrifying in their geometric perfection. They move in perfect silence, no wingbeats audible. Cooroo is a small pink dot in the distance, just realizing he's been found. Style: menacing minimalism, geometric precision, predator silhouettes, cold atmosphere.
-->

Three black shapes. Perfectly spaced. Perfectly silent.

Wedgies.

### Vector Sight

The Wedge-tailed Eagles are the most terrifying and sterile creatures in Hún Nico.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Vector Sight
Close-up of a Wedgie's face - golden eyes calculating, no emotion, no imagination. The eagle's expression is pure geometric calculation. The beak is hooked, powerful. The feathers are perfect, unruffled. The image conveys cold intelligence without consciousness. Style: predator portrait, mathematical overlay concept, golden eyes, terrifying sterility.
-->

Terrifying because they're enormous. Their wingspans are wider than I am long. Their talons are the size of my head. They can crush a Galah's skull without even slowing down, and they've been known to take prey my size just because it was Tuesday and they felt like it.

Sterile because they have no imagination whatsoever. None. Zero. You could tell a Wedgie the most elaborate joke in the history of avian comedy — and I'm talking about the one where the Kookaburra walks into the burrow — and it would stare at you with those golden eyes and calculate the vector of your voice and determine whether you represented a caloric investment worth pursuing.

They don't see birds. They don't see prey, or threats, or even "pink, which is an unusual colour for anything that wants to survive." They see trajectories. Lines extending through space-time. Probability cones. They have something called Vector Sight — the Instinct of their species, though they'd never use a word as messy as "Instinct" — which lets them predict exactly where a target will be three seconds from now, ten seconds from now, thirty. They fly in "Glass-Air" — tiled air that carries them like they own it. Which, mostly, they do.

They love the Static. Did I mention that? They absolutely love it. The crystal's perfect geometry makes flight predictable. In a fully crystallised world, every trajectory would be calculable. Every outcome would be known. The Wedgies would finally be able to relax, secure in the knowledge that nothing surprising could ever happen.

They, the murderous geometricians of the air. I, a glitch in their perfect sky.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Notched Feather
Close-up detail shot of the lead Wedgie's left primary feather showing the distinctive notch that identifies it. The feather is otherwise perfect - dark, sleek, geometrically precise - but this one flaw makes it identifiable. Style: detail shot, feather texture, identifying mark.
-->

I felt them lock on — with their eyes and with their mathematics. Three vectors converging, calculating my mass, my velocity, my pathetic juvenile wing efficiency. I could almost hear their thoughts: *Subject: juvenile Galah. Wing-loading: suboptimal. Trajectory: southeast, erratic. Caloric value: minimal. Disruption to laminar flow: maximal.*

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Herding
The three Wedgies herding Cooroo through the sky using pure geometry. The first eagle has shifted wing angle by precisely three degrees, blocking the thermal route upward. The second positioned south, cutting off retreat. The third - with a distinctive notch in its left primary feather - waits exactly where Cooroo needs to go. Lines of calculated trajectory visible in the air. Cooroo banks desperately, wings failing, the vine trailing. Style: aerial combat as geometry problem, tense, claustrophobic.
-->

The first Eagle — the northern one, slightly larger than the others — shifted its wing angle by precisely three degrees. That was enough. It blocked the thermal route upward, the path I would have taken if I had the skill for thermals, which I don't. The second Eagle moved south, cutting off my retreat to the Ridge. I was already too far out; even if I turned back now, I'd never make it before my wings gave out.

The third Eagle — this one had a notch in its left primary feather, the only identifying mark among their perfect uniformity — positioned itself exactly where I would need to go if I wanted to continue toward the Jacaranda.

They were herding me.

I tried to change direction. My wings complained loudly. The muscles felt like they'd been replaced with hot wire. The joints screamed. I banked left, toward a gap in their formation that looked — to my desperate, exhausted eyes — like freedom.

The northern Eagle adjusted. Three degrees of wing tilt. The gap closed.

I banked right. The southern Eagle shifted. The gap closed.

The vine hummed, pulled, insisted on southeast. But southeast was where the notched Eagle waited, its talons already extending, already calculating the exact moment when our trajectories would intersect.

I was going to die. And not even an interesting death — not the heroic sacrifice of a messenger completing his mission, not the tragic fall of a young bird who reached too high. I was going to be deleted. A rounding error in the sky's calculations.

The notched Eagle was fifty metres away. Forty. Thirty.

The vine thrummed. The lilac hum in my skull chambers spiked — not in fear, but in response. The Morning Glory was sensing something. Reacting to the Wedgies' perfect geometry with its own fractal messiness.

The vine's fractal signal — that chaotic, messy resonance it broadcast — was the opposite of everything the Wedgies were. They loved order, loved the Static, loved the Lattice Song, that single crystalline tone that was replacing the world's messy music with one perfect, dead note. They hated noise. They hated chaos. They hated unpredictability.

I had one chance. One terrible, desperate, probably-suicidal chance.

I folded my wings and dropped.

### Weathertop

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Dive
Cooroo folding his wings and dropping like a stone toward the Shattered Gorge below. The Wedgies overshoot above, caught by surprise. The Gorge opens beneath him like a crack in the world. Style: vertical action, sense of falling, desperate gamble, motion blur.
-->

I dropped like a stone, folding my wings tight against my body and surrendering to gravity's pull. The air rushed past. The Wedgies, caught by surprise by this sudden violation of their probability calculations, overshot.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Crevice Impact
Cooroo crashing into the crevice wall - feathers scraping against half-formed crystal, claws scrabbling for purchase. The impact knocks breath from his lungs. The vine tangles around his leg. Crystal formations protrude from the stone like frost - hexagonal, transitional. The narrow crevice opens to a slit of sky above where Wedgies circle. Style: chaotic impact, crystal textures, confined space, desperate struggle.
-->

I crashed into the crevice wall, the impact knocking the breath out of my lungs and the sense out of my head, though my bones miraculously remained intact. I tumbled, feathers scraping against crystal, claws scrabbling for purchase on a surface that was half-stone, half-geometry. The vine got tangled around my leg, constricting, humming frantically.

I landed. Hard. On a ledge maybe three body-lengths wide, with the crevice wall behind me and a sheer drop in front. The Wedgies would recover in seconds. They'd recalculate. They'd find new vectors.

But for this moment — this breath, this heartbeat — I was alive.

I looked up. The crevice opened to a narrow slit of sky, the three black shapes already circling back, already running the new numbers. They wouldn't dive after me, as confined spaces violated their geometric principles. They simply waited.

And waiting, I was learning, was what geometry did best.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Wilted Vine
Close-up of the Morning Glory vine wilting in Cooroo's claws. The once-vibrant lilac flower now drooping, stem browning at the edges, leaves curling. The hum has stopped - it's just a plant now. The vine points feebly toward a darker section of the crevice where crystal is thinner. Style: botanical detail, wilting plant, urgency, fading hope.
-->

The vine drooped. Immediately. One second it was thrumming with that irritating lilac energy, the next it was just a plant — green, wilting, doing the plant thing where it reminds you that it needs things like "water" and "nutrients" and "not being carried by an incompetent bird across hostile terrain."

It needed Arnam. The moisture that carries compassion. And the Gorge was dry as a dingo's joke.

I looked around the crevice. The walls were fascinating, in a horrible sort of way. The crystal here wasn't fully formed — it was transitional, the Static in the process of claiming territory. Hexagonal formations protruded from the stone like frost spreading on a windowpane, half-formed, blurry at the edges. Some faces caught the light and split it into prismatic arcs. Others were still rough, still stone, still resisting. I counted them anyway, because when you're about to die, counting is what you do instead of screaming.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Wedgies Wait
The three Wedgies perched at the top of the crevice, perfectly spaced, forming an equilateral triangle against the sky. They don't enter - that would be messy, unpredictable. They just watch, calculating the geometry of Cooroo's death. The notched eagle in center, head turned, tracking with one golden eye. Style: menacing patience, architectural composition, predatory beauty, hopeless odds.
-->

The notched Eagle appeared at the top of the crevice. It didn't enter — that would be messy, emotional, unpredictable. It just perched there, watching, calculating the geometry of my death.

The other two Eagles joined it. Three perfect shapes against the sky, forming an equilateral triangle. They were beautiful, in the way that the Static was beautiful. Perfect. Cold. Finished.

The vine twitched. A small movement, barely perceptible, but it caught my attention. It was pointing — still pointing — toward the back of the crevice. Toward a darker section where the crystal formations were thinner.

I followed its gesture. The crevice narrowed, became a crack, became a gap barely wide enough for a desperate bird. But the vine pulled, and I was beyond questioning its wisdom.

I squeezed through. Crystal scraped my feathers. I lost a few — pink down floating in the still air, catching the light. The Wedgies watched from above, tracking my movement, recalculating. They didn't follow. The gap was too narrow for their wingspans, too chaotic for their Vector Sight.

I emerged into a small chamber. A pocket in the stone, maybe five body-lengths across, with a floor of mixed dirt and crystal and —

Water.

Not much. A seep, really, moisture bleeding from a crack in the wall where the Static hadn't fully claimed the stone. But it was wet. It was alive.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Water Seep
Cooroo discovering a small seep in the crystal chamber wall. Just a trickle, barely enough, but wet and alive. He plunges the vine's roots into the moisture. The effect is immediate - the lilac hum returns, the vine revives. Style: discovery moment, renewal, small miracle, hopeful light.
-->

I plunged the vine's roots into the moisture. The effect was immediate. The lilac hum returned, stronger now, resonating off the crystal walls in ways that made my skull chambers ring. The vine revived, stood upright, pointed southeast with renewed insistence.

But the Wedgies hadn't given up. I could hear their wings beating, trying to re-establish their formations. They were converging on the chamber's exit, positioning themselves for the moment when I'd have to emerge.

I was trapped. The water would keep the vine alive for a while, but not forever. And I was hungry, exhausted, trembling with the aftereffects of terror and exertion.

The notched Eagle appeared at the gap. Its head turned, tracking me with one golden eye. It couldn't fit through — the gap was too narrow — but it could watch. It could wait.

The geometry, as always, was on its side.

And I thought: this is stupid.

Not the situation — though the situation was definitely stupid. The whole premise of it. The Wedgies flew in perfect formation because they loved order. They loved the Static. They hated noise. They hated chaos. They hated the Noble Noise.

I looked at the crystal walls. They were beautiful — prismatic, perfect, resonant. But what would they do to the opposite frequency?

I opened my beak.

I unleashed the ugliest, most fractal, most deliberately messy sound I could produce — no frequency check or mapping scream, but raw chaos — the scream I'd found on the stump, amplified now by desperation and the weird acoustics of the crystal chamber.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Weaponized Scream
Cooroo opening his beak in the crystal chamber, producing the ugliest, most fractal, deliberately messy scream possible. The sound visualized as chaotic waves, jagged frequencies, amplifying off the crystal walls. Crystal actually fracturing - a whole section of Gorge wall exploding into quartz dust. Style: dramatic action, visible sound waves, crystal shattering, chaotic energy.
-->

The sound hit the walls and shattered.

Not metaphorically. Actually. The Noble Noise, weaponized, focused by the geometry of the chamber, struck the crystal walls at their resonance frequency — which, it turns out, is a very specific note that I happened to hit by accident because I have no training and even less control.

The crystal fractured. A whole section of the Gorge wall — ten metres of half-formed hexagonal lattice — exploded into quartz dust.

The cloud filled the chamber instantly. I couldn't see. I couldn't breathe. The dust was everywhere, in my feathers, in my eyes, in my beak.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Crystal Dust Storm
The crystal chamber filled with powdered geometry - quartz dust everywhere. Cooroo waddling/running through the dust storm, the Morning Glory clutched tight. Behind him, the collapsed wall has created a new exit - a jagged tear in the crystal, rough and un-geometric. The Wedgies screech in the dust above. Style: chaotic escape, dust storm, limited visibility, desperate movement.
-->

The Wedgies screeched. Their Vector Sight depended on clear air, on visible trajectories. The dust cloud scattered everything — light, vectors, probability. They were blind.

I ran.

Not flew — running is what you do when your wings have given up and your lungs are burning and you're carrying a wilting vine through a crystal dust storm. I waddled, basically. Galahs run the way we do most things: with determination, poor grace, and surprising speed given our body shape.

The collapsing wall had created a new exit — a jagged tear in the crystal, rough and uneven and completely un-geometric. I squeezed through, crystal fragments cutting my feathers, the vine clutched tight against my chest.

I burst out of the Gorge into open air.

And immediately crashed.
