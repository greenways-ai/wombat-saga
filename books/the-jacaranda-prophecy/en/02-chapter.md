### The Departure

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Departure
A juvenile Galah standing on the jagged edge of the Silver Wattle stump, the Morning Glory vine gripped carefully in his claws. The vine thrums with visible lilac energy, vibrating against his talons. His crest is raised with determination, his too-short wings slightly spread. Behind him, his mother Cooriki is a tiny pink shape on a distant Eucalyptus branch, her own crest just visible - raised for the first time. The curved world of Hún Nico rises in the background, Elen-Nico burning at the center. The light is the swell phase, golden and warm. Mood: reluctant heroism, the weight of mission, leaving without goodbye. Style: fantasy illustration, epic departure moment, atmospheric lighting.
-->

Here's something they don't tell you about saving the world: it involves a lot of physical exertion.

You'd think a grand mission would come with some kind of fitness exemption. Nope. Apparently "bearing the memory of a dead god-tree across a heart-shaped world to graft onto a foreign sapling" still requires cardio. Who knew.

I stood on the edge of the **Silver Wattle** stump with the Morning Glory vine gripped in my claws and seriously reconsidered my life choices. The vine was surprisingly heavy for something that looked like a piece of coloured string. It thrummed against my talons — that lilac hum that had settled in my skull chambers, vibrating at a frequency that felt less like "carrying a plant" and more like "holding onto a live electrical wire that happens to be photosynthetic."

My wings, I should mention, are still too short. This is a juvenile thing. My body hasn't caught up to my beak, which is enormous and pink and frankly embarrassing. Other Galahs look at me and think "he's going to grow into that." I look at me and think "I'm about to attempt sustained long-distance flight with the aerodynamic profile of a feathered grapefruit."

But the vine pulled.

The resonance in my skull chambers pulled me southeast like a compass needle, a deep, internal wrongness that grew the longer I stood still.

I looked back at Mum one last time. She was still on her Eucalyptus branch, still staring at the void where the Silver Wattle used to be, but her crest had gone up when I screamed. That was something. That was a crack in her internal sanctuary, a hairline fracture in the crystal of her grief. I wanted to say goodbye properly, to explain that I was carrying the Silver Wattle's memory to a new tree, to tell her that the Noble Noise had a return again if she would just listen for it.

But world-saviours don't get proper goodbyes. They get jumped-off-stumps with wilting vines and the vague hope that their mothers might notice they're gone.

I jumped.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: Into the Heavy Breath
Cooroo jumping from the stump into Thúlë Lunga - the Heavy Breath atmospheric layer. The air is visibly thick, dense, humid, carrying scents of eucalyptus and distant rain. The young Galah's wings are spread awkwardly, too short for his body, flapping with desperate uneven strokes. His beak is enormous and pink, comically oversized for his juvenile head. The Morning Glory vine trails from his claws, its leaves streaming in the wind. Below, the Eastern Ridge falls away - the crystalline Bad Grounds gleaming. Style: dynamic action, sense of physical struggle, thick atmospheric effects, early morning light.
-->

The Heavy Breath — Thúlë Lunga — caught me immediately. This is the lowest atmospheric layer, the dense, humid, mud-scented air near the surface. It's the only layer I'm technically rated for, being a juvenile with delusions of prophecy. In the Heavy Breath, the air is so thick you can almost chew it. It smells of eucalyptus and distant rain and the particular mineral tang that the wombats call "Arnam-potential" — the possibility of compassion, not yet actualized, hanging in the atmosphere like humidity before a storm. If I were a proper flier, I'd be looking for Arnam-Ringa — thermal columns rising from warm patches below — but I don't have the experience to spot the Palar-Tinta, the thermal triggers, so I just flapped and hoped.

My wings have something to push against here. The problem is, the Jacaranda wasn't in the Heavy Breath. The Jacaranda was far. Past the Burnt Scrub, past the Gorge, into territory my wings couldn't possibly reach.

I flapped. The motion was wrong — too desperate, too uneven, the wingbeats of a bird who hasn't learned the proper technique for distance flight. Proper Galahs don't flap continuously; they ride thermals, they spiral upward on columns of warm air, they let the world do the work. But I didn't have thermals. I had a vine that hummed and pulled and insisted on southeast.

The vine hummed louder. And somehow — I still don't understand the physics of this — the hum translated into lift.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: The Fractal Signal
Cooroo rising through the atmosphere on chaotic, resonance-driven flight. The Morning Glory vine broadcasts a Fractal Signal - visualized as jagged, lilac-colored turbulence in the air around him. Unlike the elegant thermal-riding of proper Galahs, this is messy, chaotic, Súlë Arnan (Breath of Chaos). Raca - broken air - fractal turbulence patterns visible as distortions in the atmosphere. The vine hums with energy that translates into unnatural lift. Background: the thinning Heavy Breath giving way to colder air. Wedgies visible as distant dark shapes. Style: magical flight, chaotic energy patterns, unconventional propulsion, sense of rule-breaking.
-->

Not normal lift. Not the elegant thermal-riding that proper Galahs do, finding the Yá of a rising column and circling upward with the grace of creatures who belong in the sky. This was messy, chaotic, resonance-driven flight. The vine was broadcasting something — a Fractal Signal. In a world going digital and geometric, this signal screamed "Chaos." The old Galah term for it is *Súlë Arnan*, the Breath of Chaos, but that makes it sound poetic and intentional. It wasn't. It was Raca — broken air — fractal turbulence in an atmosphere that was learning to prefer Axan-Vilya, the laminar flow.

It would attract attention. But it was the only way to fly.

I rose. Slowly, jerkily, like a kite being pulled by a child who hasn't quite figured out how wind works. The Eastern Ridge fell away beneath me — the stump where I'd spent five weeks in silence, the Bad Ground with its hexagonal sheen, Mum's tiny pink shape on her Eucalyptus branch. I wanted to call out to her, but I needed every breath for flight, every heartbeat for keeping my wings moving.

The Heavy Breath got colder as I climbed. That's the thing about heart-shaped worlds — up means toward the center, toward Elen-Nico, and the center is 140 kilometres away. The air thins gradually, not all at once. You don't hit a wall; you just notice, gradually, that your wings are working harder for less result.

I found a line of air moving southeast, the Rómen-Sírë, a rare East-Flow carrying moist air from the Jacaranda territory. I locked into it, letting the current do the work while my wings rested in brief, precious glides. My Talan-Tië — my actual track across the ground — was southeast, even if my Napa-Tië — where my beak pointed — kept drifting with the Lasta, the lateral offset of crosswinds.

The vine approved. The hum steadied, became a drone, a carrier wave that my skull chambers could lock onto. It was pulling me toward the Rómen-Sírë — the East-Flow from the Jacaranda territory, a wind that shouldn't exist in the normal circulation of Hún Nico, but did. It was like having a map written directly into my nervous system. Southeast. Always southeast. If I were a better flier, I might have found a Tië-Ringa — a Cloud Street, a highway of thermals allowing for long glides without flapping. But I didn't have the skill to read the air that way. I just followed the hum.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Burnt Scrub Below
Aerial view of the Burnt Scrub - a charcoal wasteland of dead eucalyptus, the blackened trunks standing like the fingers of a corpse. Bark still dropping from skeletal branches. The landscape is grey and black, devoid of green. From high above, movement visible between the trees - something large and dark prowling, possibly a dingo or something worse. The ground is ash and crystallized patches. Cooroo's small pink form flies high above, vulnerable and exposed. Light: harsh, unforgiving, midday. Style: post-apocalyptic landscape, aerial perspective, desolation, threat implied.
-->

I flew for an hour. Then two. My wings burned. My chest heaved. The Heavy Breath was thinner now, colder, closer to the Law-Wind layer where the real fliers — the Wedgies, the Eagles, the predators who owned the sky — made their territory.

Below me, the landscape changed. The Burnt Scrub spread out in a charcoal wasteland, eucalyptus trunks standing like the fingers of a corpse, still dropping bark, still waiting for fires they couldn't survive. I saw movement down there — something large and dark prowling between the trees — but I was too high and too tired to identify it. Dingo, maybe. Or something worse.

The vine didn't care about the dangers below. It pulled. I followed.

My wings were failing. Juvenile feathers aren't built for marathon flight. I could feel the individual muscles in my back screaming, the joints where wing met body protesting every stroke. I was going to fall. It wasn't a question of if, but when, and whether I'd reach the Gorge before my body gave out entirely.

That's when I felt them.

A disturbance in the Heavy Breath. The air suddenly too orderly, too patterned, as if someone had drawn lines through it and expected the wind to follow. I looked up and my heart — already overworked, already terrified — did something complicated involving stopping and starting at the same time.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: The Wedgies Appear
Three Wedge-tailed Eagles silhouetted against the pale sky, perfectly spaced in an equilateral triangle formation. They are enormous - wingspans wider than Cooroo is long. Their shapes are pure black against the light, terrifying in their geometric perfection. They move in perfect silence, no wingbeats audible. The air around them seems too orderly, too patterned, as if drawn with straight lines. Cooroo is a small pink dot in the distance, just realizing he's been found. The Law-Wind layer - cold, thin, sterile. Style: menacing minimalism, geometric precision, predator silhouettes, cold atmosphere.
-->

Three black shapes. Perfectly spaced. Perfectly silent.

Wedgies.

### Vector Sight

The Wedge-tailed Eagles are the most terrifying and sterile creatures in Hún Nico.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: Vector Sight
Close-up of a Wedgie's face - golden eyes calculating, no emotion, no imagination. Visible overlay suggestion of Vector Sight - probability cones extending from the eagle's gaze, trajectory lines predicting where Cooroo will be. The eagle's expression is pure geometric calculation: "Subject: juvenile Galah. Wing-loading: suboptimal. Trajectory: southeast, erratic." The beak is hooked, powerful. The feathers are perfect, unruffled. Behind, the other two Wedgies maintain formation. The image conveys cold intelligence without consciousness. Style: predator portrait, mathematical overlay concept, golden eyes, terrifying sterility.
-->

Terrifying because they're enormous. Their wingspans are wider than I am long. Their talons are the size of my head. They can crush a Galah's skull without even slowing down, and they've been known to take prey my size just because it was Tuesday and they felt like it.

Sterile because they have no imagination whatsoever. None. Zero. You could tell a Wedgie the most elaborate joke in the history of avian comedy — and I'm talking about the one where the Kookaburra walks into the burrow — and it would stare at you with those golden eyes and calculate the vector of your voice and determine whether you represented a caloric investment worth pursuing.

They don't see birds. They don't see prey, or threats, or even "pink, which is an unusual colour for anything that wants to survive." They see trajectories. Lines extending through space-time. Probability cones. They have something called Vector Sight — the Instinct of their species, though they'd never use a word as messy as "Instinct" — which lets them predict exactly where a target will be three seconds from now, ten seconds from now, thirty. They fly in "Glass-Air" — that's what the old lexicon calls the high Law-Wind — tiled air that carries them like they own it. Which, mostly, they do.

They love the Static. Did I mention that? They absolutely love it. The crystal's perfect geometry makes flight predictable. In a fully crystallised world, every trajectory would be calculable. Every outcome would be known. The Wedgies would finally be able to relax, secure in the knowledge that nothing surprising could ever happen.

They, the murderous geometricians of the air. And I, a glitch in their perfect sky.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 30: The Notched Feather
Close-up detail shot of the lead Wedgie's left primary feather showing the distinctive notch that identifies it. The feather is otherwise perfect - dark, sleek, geometrically precise - but this one flaw, this imperfection, makes it identifiable. Against the sky, the feather catches light. A reminder that even perfect predators have marks, histories, identities. The notch is small but significant - the only way to tell this eagle from its perfectly uniform companions. Style: detail shot, feather texture, identifying mark, subtle characterization, natural history illustration.
-->

I felt them lock on - with their eyes and with their mathematics. Three vectors converging, calculating my mass, my velocity, my pathetic juvenile wing efficiency. I could almost hear their thoughts: *Subject: juvenile Galah. Wing-loading: suboptimal. Trajectory: southeast, erratic. Caloric value: minimal. Disruption to laminar flow: maximal.*

They converged with geometric precision, their movement deliberately sterile and calculated.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The Herding
The three Wedgies herding Cooroo through the sky using pure geometry. The first eagle has shifted wing angle by precisely three degrees, blocking the thermal route upward. The second positioned south, cutting off retreat to the Ridge. The third - with a distinctive notch in its left primary feather - waits exactly where Cooroo needs to go to reach the Jacaranda. Their formation is an evolving geometric puzzle with Cooroo as the piece that cannot fit. Lines of calculated trajectory visible in the air. Cooroo banks desperately, wings failing, the vine trailing. Style: aerial combat as geometry problem, tense, claustrophobic, mathematical precision vs organic desperation.
-->

The first Eagle — the northern one, slightly larger than the others — shifted its wing angle by precisely three degrees. That was enough. It blocked the thermal route upward, the path I would have taken if I had the skill for thermals, which I don't. The second Eagle moved south, cutting off my retreat to the Ridge. I was already too far out; even if I turned back now, I'd never make it before my wings gave out.

The third Eagle — this one had a notch in its left primary feather, the only identifying mark among their perfect uniformity — positioned itself exactly where I would need to go if I wanted to continue toward the Jacaranda.

They were herding me.

I tried to change direction. My wings, already overworked from carrying both my body weight and a sacred burden, complained loudly. The muscles felt like they'd been replaced with hot wire. The joints screamed. I banked left, toward a gap in their formation that looked — to my desperate, exhausted eyes — like freedom.

The northern Eagle adjusted. Three degrees of wing tilt. The gap closed.

I banked right. The southern Eagle shifted. The gap closed.

The vine hummed, pulled, insisted on southeast. But southeast was where the notched Eagle waited, its talons already extending, already calculating the exact moment when our trajectories would intersect.

I was going to die. And not even an interesting death — not the heroic sacrifice of a messenger completing his mission, not the tragic fall of a young bird who reached too high. I was going to be deleted. A rounding error in the sky's calculations. "Subject eliminated due to Raca in Axan-Vilya." Locked into their probability cone, my Talan-Tië diverging from my Napa-Tië until there was nowhere left to fly.

The notched Eagle began its approach. A gradual adjustment of velocity and angle, closing the distance at exactly the speed required to intercept me at exactly the moment when my wings would be too tired to evade.

I looked down. The Burnt Scrub was far below. Too far to fall into, not that falling into charcoal wasteland was an improvement. The Gorge was visible in the distance — a crack in the world, a place where the crystal had failed to tile properly. But I couldn't reach it. The geometry was wrong.

The geometry was always wrong when you were a Galah.

The notched Eagle was fifty metres away. Forty. Thirty.

The vine thrummed. The lilac hum in my skull chambers spiked — not in fear, but in response. The Morning Glory was sensing something. Reacting to the Wedgies' perfect geometry with its own fractal messiness.

As the vine's lilac hum spiked in response to the Wedgies' perfect geometry, it became my weapon. A weapon with no instructions but I still understood: the vine's fractal signal — that chaotic, messy resonance it broadcast — was the opposite of everything the Wedgies were. They loved order, loved the Static, loved the Lattice Song, that single crystalline tone that was replacing the world's messy music with one perfect, dead note. They hated noise. They hated chaos. They hated unpredictability.

The vine created Raca — broken air, turbulent chaos. That was the weapon. But to use it, I had to become chaotic too. I had to do something their Vector Sight couldn't predict, something that violated their geometric calculations entirely.
I had one chance. One terrible, desperate, probably-suicidal chance.

I folded my wings and dropped.

### Weathertop

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The Dive
Cooroo folding his wings and dropping like a stone toward the Shattered Gorge below. His body is a compact pink-grey blur, the Morning Glory vine clutched tight. The Wedgies overshoot above, caught by surprise by this violation of their probability calculations - their vectors extending into empty air where the Galah should have been. The Gorge opens beneath him like a crack in the world - a jagged tear where crystal meets stone. Air rushing past, feathers flat against his body. Style: vertical action, sense of falling, desperate gamble, motion blur, vertical composition.
-->

I dropped like a stone, a purposeful dive, folding my wings tight against my body and surrendering to gravity's pull. The air rushed past. The Wedgies, caught by surprise by this sudden violation of their probability calculations, overshot.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 9: The Crevice Impact
Cooroo crashing into the crevice wall - feathers scraping against half-formed crystal, claws scrabbling for purchase on a surface that is half-stone, half-geometry. The impact is hard, knocking breath from his lungs. The vine tangles around his leg, constricting. Crystal formations protrude from the stone like frost on a windowpane - hexagonal, transitional, blurry at the edges. Some faces catch light and split into prismatic arcs. Others are still rough stone, resisting geometry. The narrow crevice opens to a slit of sky above where Wedgies circle. Style: chaotic impact, crystal textures, confined space, desperate struggle, prismatic light effects.
-->

I crashed into the crevice wall. Not hard enough to break bones, but hard enough to knock the breath out of my lungs and the sense out of my head. I tumbled, feathers scraping against crystal, claws scrabbling for purchase on a surface that was half-stone, half-geometry. The vine got tangled around my leg, constricting, humming frantically.

I landed. Hard. On a ledge maybe three body-lengths wide, with the crevice wall behind me and a sheer drop in front. The Wedgies would recover in seconds. They'd recalculate. They'd find new vectors.

But for this moment — this breath, this heartbeat — I was alive.

I looked up. The crevice opened to a narrow slit of sky, the three black shapes already circling back, already running the new numbers. They wouldn't dive after me. Diving into confined spaces violated their geometric principles. But they didn't need to dive. They just needed to wait.

And waiting, I was learning, was what geometry did best.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 11: The Wilted Vine
Close-up of the Morning Glory vine wilting in Cooroo's claws. The once-vibrant lilac flower now drooping, stem browning at the edges, leaves curling. The hum has stopped - it's just a plant now, reminding him it needs water, nutrients, not being carried by an incompetent bird. The vine points feebly toward a darker section of the crevice where crystal is thinner. The background shows the dry crystal chamber, the Wedgies visible as silhouettes above. Urgent need for Arnam - the moisture that carries compassion. Style: botanical detail, wilting plant, urgency, fading hope, intimate close-up.
-->

The vine drooped. Immediately. One second it was thrumming with that irritating lilac energy, the next it was just a plant — green, wilting, doing the plant thing where it reminds you that it needs things like "water" and "nutrients" and "not being carried by an incompetent bird across hostile terrain."

Arnam. It needed Arnam. The moisture that carries compassion, the substrate of organic connection. And the Gorge was dry as a dingo's joke.

I looked around the crevice. The walls were fascinating, in a horrible sort of way. The crystal here wasn't fully formed — it was transitional, the Static in the process of claiming territory. Hexagonal formations protruded from the stone like frost spreading on a windowpane, half-formed, blurry at the edges. Some faces caught the light and split it into prismatic arcs. Others were still rough, still stone, still resisting. The angles varied — some near 120 degrees, others tilted, knocked askew by the rock's stubborn refusal to become geometry. I counted them anyway, because when you're about to die, counting is what you do instead of screaming.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 10: The Wedgies Wait
The three Wedgies perched at the top of the crevice, perfectly spaced, forming an equilateral triangle against the sky. They don't enter - that would be messy, unpredictable. They just watch, calculating the geometry of Cooroo's death. The notched eagle in center, head turned, tracking with one golden eye. They are beautiful in their perfection - the beauty of skeletons, all structure and no mercy. The crevice walls frame them like a geometric gateway. Below, Cooroo is a tiny figure on a narrow ledge. Style: menacing patience, architectural composition, predatory beauty, hopeless odds.
-->

The crevice in the Shattered Gorge wasn't a hiding place. It was a trap I chose voluntarily, which is different in technical terms but feels remarkably similar in practice. The Gorge was a Gargantua — the Venturi, where air accelerates through narrow gaps — and I was leading the wedgies straight into it.

The notched Eagle appeared at the top of the crevice. It didn't enter — that would be messy, emotional, unpredictable. It just perched there, watching, calculating the geometry of my death.

The other two Eagles joined it. Three perfect shapes against the sky, forming an equilateral triangle. They were beautiful, in the way that the Static was beautiful. Perfect. Cold. Finished.

I looked at the vine. It was dying. The leaves were curling, the stem browning at the edges. All that way, all that flight, all that screaming — and the Silver Wattle's memory was going to die in a crystal crevice because I couldn't find water.

The Wedgies waited. They had time. Their wings were built for soaring, for efficient hunting, for maintaining position with minimal effort. My wings were built for... well, honestly, my wings were built for growing into, eventually, if I survived long enough to reach adulthood. Which wasn't looking likely.

The vine twitched. A small movement, barely perceptible, but it caught my attention. It was pointing — still pointing — toward the back of the crevice. Toward a darker section where the crystal formations were thinner.

I followed its gesture. The crevice narrowed, became a crack, became a gap barely wide enough for a desperate bird. But the vine pulled, and I was beyond questioning its wisdom.

I squeezed through. Crystal scraped my feathers. I lost a few — pink down floating in the still air, catching the light. The Wedgies watched from above, tracking my movement, recalculating. They didn't follow. The gap was too narrow for their wingspans, too chaotic for their Vector Sight.

I emerged into a small chamber. A pocket in the stone, maybe five body-lengths across, with a floor of mixed dirt and crystal and —

Water.

Not much. A seep, really, moisture bleeding from a crack in the wall where the Static hadn't fully claimed the stone. But it was wet. It was alive.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 12: The Water Seep
Cooroo discovering a small seep in the crystal chamber wall - moisture bleeding from a crack where the Static hasn't fully claimed the stone. Just a trickle, barely enough, but wet and alive. He plunges the vine's roots into the moisture. The effect is immediate - the lilac hum returns, the vine revives, standing upright. The chamber is small, five body-lengths across, with mixed dirt and crystal floor. Crystal walls show transitional formations - half-hexagonal, half-stone. The revived vine points southeast with renewed insistence. Style: discovery moment, renewal, small miracle, crystal chamber interior, hopeful light.
-->

I plunged the vine's roots into the moisture. The effect was immediate. The lilac hum returned, stronger now, resonating off the crystal walls in ways that made my skull chambers ring. The vine revived, stood upright, pointed southeast with renewed insistence.

But the Wedgies hadn't given up. I could hear their wings beating, trying to clear the air, trying to re-establish their formations. They were converging on the chamber's exit, positioning themselves for the moment when I'd have to emerge.

I was trapped. The chamber had no other exit. The water would keep the vine alive for a while, but not forever. And I was hungry, exhausted, trembling with the aftereffects of terror and exertion.

The notched Eagle appeared at the gap. Its head turned, tracking me with one golden eye. It couldn't fit through — the gap was too narrow — but it could watch. It could wait. It could calculate exactly how long a juvenile Galah could survive in a sealed chamber with limited water.

The geometry, as always, was on its side.

I looked at the vine. The vine looked at me, if vines can be said to look. It was alive again, humming, but we were still trapped. The Wedgies had all the time in the world. They were patient in the way that only perfect things can be patient — the patience of a crystal growing, of a hexagon tiling, of a pattern that never varies and never needs to.

And I thought: this is stupid.

Not the situation — though the situation was definitely stupid. The whole premise of it. The Wedgies flew in perfect formation because they loved order. They loved the Static. They loved the Lattice Song, that single crystalline tone that was replacing the world's messy music with one perfect, dead note.

They hated noise. They hated chaos. They hated the Noble Noise.

I looked at the crystal walls. They were beautiful — prismatic, perfect, resonant. The Lattice Song would love these walls. They would amplify the crystal frequency, make it louder, make it purer.

But what would they do to the opposite frequency?

I opened my beak.

This wasn't a frequency check. This wasn't a mapping scream or a data call. This was the ugliest, most fractal, most deliberately messy sound I could produce — the scream I'd found on the stump, the one that had cracked Mum's internal sanctuary, amplified now by desperation and the weird acoustics of the crystal chamber.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 13: The Weaponized Scream
Cooroo opening his beak in the crystal chamber, producing the ugliest, most fractal, deliberately messy scream possible. The sound visualized as chaotic waves, jagged frequencies, amplifying off the crystal walls. The Noble Noise weaponized - striking the walls at their resonance frequency. Crystal actually fracturing - a whole section of Gorge wall exploding into quartz dust. Ten meters of half-formed hexagonal lattice shattering. The feedback loop of chaos feeding on itself. Cooroo's feathers fluffed, crest fully erect, whole body engaged in the scream. Style: dramatic action, visible sound waves, crystal shattering, chaotic energy, intense moment.
-->

The sound hit the walls and shattered.

Not metaphorically. Actually. The Noble Noise, weaponized, focused by the geometry of the chamber, struck the crystal walls at their resonance frequency — which, it turns out, is a very specific note that I happened to hit by accident because I have no training and even less control.

The crystal fractured. A whole section of the Gorge wall — ten metres of half-formed hexagonal lattice, transitional geometry, frost-like tiling that hadn't quite finished becoming perfect — exploded into quartz dust.

The cloud filled the chamber instantly. I couldn't see. I couldn't breathe. The dust was everywhere, in my feathers, in my eyes, in my beak, coating everything with a layer of powdered geometry. The sound continued — my scream, reflected and amplified by the collapsing walls, becoming a feedback loop of chaos that fed on itself.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 14: The Crystal Dust Storm
The crystal chamber filled with powdered geometry - quartz dust everywhere, obscuring everything. Cooroo waddling/running through the dust storm, the Morning Glory clutched tight against his chest. He can't see, can't breathe, dust coating his feathers, in his eyes, his beak. Behind him, the collapsed wall has created a new exit - a jagged tear in the crystal, rough and un-geometric. The Wedgies screech in the dust above, their Vector Sight blinded, their perfect geometry disrupted by chaos. Pink down floats in the still air, catching light. Style: chaotic escape, dust storm, limited visibility, desperate movement, textured atmosphere.
-->

The Wedgies screeched. Actual emotion, how undignified. Their Vector Sight depended on clear air, on visible trajectories, on the ability to track lines through space. The dust cloud scattered everything — light, vectors, probability. They were blind.

I ran.

Not flew — running is what you do when your wings have given up and your lungs are burning and you're carrying a wilting vine through a crystal dust storm. I waddled, basically. Galahs run the way we do most things: with determination, poor grace, and surprising speed given our body shape.

The dust was my cover. The collapsing wall had created a new exit — a jagged tear in the crystal, rough and uneven and completely un-geometric. I squeezed through, crystal fragments cutting my feathers, the vine clutched tight against my chest.

Behind me, the Wedgies were recovering. I could hear their wings beating, trying to clear the air, trying to re-establish their formations. But the dust was too thick, the chaos too complete.

I burst out of the Gorge into open air.

And immediately crashed.

### Strider

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 15: Crash on the Steppe
Cooroo hitting the ground of the Emu Steppe with all the elegance of a thrown rock. The Morning Glory cushions his impact slightly before being squashed beneath him. He lies there, wings sprawled, feathers frayed, utterly exhausted. The sky curves up around him in all directions - the bowl of Hún Nico's inner surface. His juvenile wings are done - finished, muscles spasming, joints screaming. He's a flightless bird in a world designed for fliers. The Steppe grass is grey-brown, sparse. The Wedgies are visible as dark shapes emerging from the Gorge behind him. Style: impact moment, exhaustion, defeat, ground-level perspective, vulnerable protagonist.
-->

The Emu Steppe isn't a place you choose to land. It's a place you end up when better options have expired.

I hit the ground with all the elegance of a pink rock, the Morning Glory vine cushioning my impact slightly before being squashed beneath me. For a moment, I just lay there, contemplating the many ways in which prophecy was overrated. The sky was doing that thing where it curves up in every direction, the inner surface of Hún Nico wrapping around me like a bowl, and I was the pathetic little piece of debris at the bottom.

My wings were done. Finished. The juvenile feathers were frayed, the muscles spasming, the joints screaming in protest. I couldn't fly anymore. I could barely walk. I was a flightless bird in a world designed for fliers, carrying a dying plant to a tree I couldn't reach.

The Wedgies emerged from the Gorge. Three black shapes, no longer in perfect formation — I'd managed to disrupt their geometry, which I would have found satisfying if I wasn't about to be disassembled. They circled above, re-establishing their calculations, preparing for the final approach.

I stood up, wobbling, positioned myself between the Wedgies and the vine. It was a stupid gesture — the vine was a plant, it didn't need protection, and my body certainly couldn't provide any — but it felt important. The Silver Wattle's memory had come this far. It deserved to go the rest of the way.

The lead Eagle — I could tell it was the lead because it was slightly more geometric than the others — adjusted its wings and began the final descent.

Then the ground moved.

Not an earthquake. Not the static rising. An Emu.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 16: The Spiral Run Begins
The ground moving - not earthquake, but an Emu. Two meters of feathered dinosaur with no fear, armored scaled legs, sickle claws, dried-blood eyes. The Emu is running in a spiral pattern - a vast, looping, non-repeating trajectory that carves a groove in the Steppe grass. Each footfall lands where geometry says it shouldn't, generating pure chaos. Air twisting around the Emu, becoming turbulent, unpredictable - pure Raca (broken air). The Wedgies scatter in panic above, their formation torn apart by the wake turbulence. The Emu is grey-brown, the color of the Steppe, feathers coarse and lacquered like body armor. Style: dynamic action, spiral motion blur, sudden intervention, powerful creature, kinetic chaos visualized.
-->

If you've never seen an Emu up close, congratulations on your sensible life choices. They are enormous — two metres of bird that evolution designed by asking "what if a feathered dinosaur had no fear and even less patience?" Their legs are armored, scaled, built for running distances that would kill lesser creatures. Their claws are sickles, curved and sharp and designed to disembowel. Their eyes are the colour of dried blood and they look at you with an expression that says "I am considering whether you are worth the effort of killing."

This one was running. Not toward me — that would have been simple. It was running in a spiral, a vast, looping, non-repeating pattern that carved a groove in the Steppe grass and shredded the air currents with its passage.

The Emu's feet struck the earth in rhythms that made no sense — left, then right, then somehow both and neither — each step landing where geometry said it shouldn't, where prediction failed, where the neat lines of probability frayed into chaos. The air around it curdled, curdled and churned, tearing itself apart in the wake of that impossible gait. What had been Glass-Air — smooth, tiled, predictable — became Raca, became brokenness, became the kind of turbulence that laughed at vectors and mocked trajectories. The Wedgies' perfect mathematics crumbled before it, their calculated certainties dissolving into the swirling madness of the Emu's wake.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 17: The Walker and the Wedgies
The Emu standing absolutely still after its spiral run - one second a blur of motion, the next absolute coiled potential. Around it, the air still churns with the turbulence of its passing. The three Wedgies circle helplessly at the edge of visibility, unable to approach the Spiral Zone of pure unpredictability. Their Vector Sight cannot penetrate Raca - broken air. The Emu's dried-blood eyes track them without fear. The Steppe stretches in all directions. Cooroo is a small pink shape huddled nearby, watching this impossible bird disrupt the sky through sheer aggressive movement. Style: standoff, tense stillness after motion, predator intimidation, atmospheric disturbance, power dynamic.
-->

The Wedgies broke. Immediately. No calculation, no geometric adjustment — just pure, panicked evasion as the Emu's wake turbulence tore their formation apart.

The spiral tightened. The Emu wasn't just running; it was weaving chaos itself into the air, each impossible step churning the atmosphere into Raca — broken air, turbulent madness. The Wedgies' Vector Sight couldn't penetrate it. Their mathematics failed them here. You can't calculate the trajectory of Raca. The Spiral Zone was pure unpredictability, and the Wedgies kept their distance from it, circling at the edge like dogs afraid of fire.

I watched, beak open, vine forgotten, as this impossible bird disrupted the sky through sheer aggressive movement. The Emu was grey-brown, the colour of the Steppe itself, and its feathers — coarse, lacquered, evolution's answer to body armor — caught the light in a way that made it shimmer, made it hard to track, made it impossible to predict.

The Wedgies regrouped at a distance, circling, unwilling to approach. The Emu slowed, stopped — one second it was a blur of motion, the next it was absolutely still, coiled potential, a spring that had decided to wait.

It turned its head and looked at me.

Looked at the vine.

Looked at the Wedgies, circling helplessly above, unable to approach.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 18: The Offer
The Emu lowering its massive armored neck to Cooroo's level - a gesture unprecedented in the history of the Southern Shell. The great head with dried-blood eyes regards the small Galah with an unreadable expression. The posture says: "Get on. Or don't. I don't care. But decide." The Emu's feathers are coarse, each one the size of Cooroo's wing. The Wedgies still circle overhead, watching but unable to approach. Cooroo looks up at this impossible offer, the Morning Glory vine still clutched in his claws, confusion and hope mixed in his posture. Style: intimate moment between species, unprecedented connection, character interaction, dramatic lighting.
-->

Then it lowered its massive, armored neck — a gesture I had never seen in any natural history text, any field guide, any story told by any bird in any colony. The neck came down to my level, the great head with its dried-blood eyes regarding me with an expression I couldn't read.

"You're... offering me a ride?"

The Emu said nothing. Emus don't say things. They exist at a volume that makes speech redundant. The posture was clear: *Get on. Or don't. I don't care. But decide, because I have spirals to run.*

"That's not... that's not a thing. Emus don't give rides. That's a fundamental... there's a Code. The Walker's Code. Emus are solitary. They don't carry passengers. It's a violation of..."

The Emu shifted its weight. One massive foot lifted, came down. The ground vibrated. The message, if possible, became clearer: *Get on or get eaten by Wedgies. I have no preference. But the window for decision-making is closing.*

I looked at the Wedgies. They were regrouping, recalculating, finding new vectors. They wouldn't stay scared forever.

I looked at the vine. It was humming again, responding to the Emu's chaos, finding resonance in the turbulent wake of that impossible gait.

I got on.


### The Apostate

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 19: Riding the Spiral
Cooroo clinging to the Emu's back as they move at sixty kilometers per hour across the Steppe. The Galah is essentially a pink hat with opinions - claws dug into coarse lacquered feathers, body bouncing with each footfall. The Emu's spiral pattern is fractal, non-repeating, each footfall landing where prediction fails. The wind tears at Cooroo's feathers. The landscape blurs - grassland, scrub, occasional stone outcroppings. The vine revives in the chaos of the Emu's wake, its lilac hum stronger, pointing southeast. The Wedgies follow at a distance, keeping their distance from the Spiral Zone. Style: high-speed motion, blurred background, clinging for dear life, chaotic energy, partnership forming.
-->

Here's what they teach you in Galah school about Emus: nothing.

Absolutely nothing, because Galahs don't have school and even if we did, Emus wouldn't be on the curriculum. They exist in a separate category — the Walkers of the Southern Steppe, the creatures who patrol the land and others do the explaining for them. You don't learn about Emus. You stay out of their way and hope they've decided you're not worth killing today.

Riding one is not a thing.

It's like... okay. Imagine you're a small, loud, mostly useless creature — which, if you're a Galah, you don't have to imagine — and suddenly you're on the back of a feathered tank that's moving at sixty kilometres per hour across terrain that technically counts as "ground" only in the loosest sense. The Emu's feathers — coarse, lacquered, each one the size of my wing — chafed against my claws. Its back was too wide for a proper grip and too narrow for stability. I was essentially a pink hat that had opinions about theology.

I dug my claws in and tried not to scream. The Emu launched.

We moved. Not in a straight line — Emus don't do straight lines. The Emu swerved and looped with no pattern I could follow, each stride carrying us in a direction I didn't expect. The world blurred into streaks of grey-brown and green. My claws dug deeper, holding on as the ground beneath us seemed to tilt and roll like the surface of a storm-tossed sea. The air thickened, churned up by our passage, pressing against my feathers with a force that felt almost solid — something alive and electric, something the Wedgies couldn't see through and couldn't calculate.

The wind tore at my feathers. The landscape blurred — grassland, scrub, the occasional outcropping of stone. The Steppe wasn't flat; it rolled, undulated, rose and fell in patterns that the Emu navigated without slowing, without hesitation. Its feet knew the ground. Its body knew the pattern.

I risked a look back. The Wedgies were following — of course they were following, they were nothing if not persistent — but they kept their distance. Way back, circling at the edge of visibility, watching but not approaching.

They were afraid. Of the Emu, sure — everyone with sense is afraid of Emus — but also of what we represented. The Walker had a rider. In the history of the Southern Shell, in all the scrolls and songs and silent traditions that the Emus maintained without ever writing down, no Emu had ever allowed a rider. It was a fundamental breach of the Code. The isolation of the Steppe, the refusal of connection, the purity of the spiral — all of it violated by one Galah with a wilting flower.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 20: The Changing Landscape
The landscape changing color as the Emu runs - grey-brown of the Steppe giving way to scrubland, then to zones where crystal formations are visible but broken. The Static tried to claim territory here and failed. Fractured geometry, broken crystal tiles. The air carries moisture and scent from somewhere alive. Purple tints appear in the vegetation - the influence of the Jacaranda already disrupting the lattice, creating defects where life can grip. The Rómen-Sírë (East-Flow) strengthening. Cooroo looks ahead with hope, the vine humming urgently. Style: transition landscape, hope emerging, broken crystal vs living vegetation, purple tones entering palette, journey progression.
-->

I saw one of the Wedgies break formation, angle its wings toward the upper atmosphere. It was signaling — not to the others, but up, toward the Law-Wind, toward the Frequency Void where the big birds lived. The message was clear enough even for me to read: *"The Walker has a rider. Just wait until the Shogun hears about this."*

I didn't know who the Shogun was. I had a feeling I would find out.

But for now, we ran.

The Emu didn't acknowledge me. Not once. It ran as if I wasn't there, as if my weight was irrelevant, as if carrying a juvenile bird on a mission and a foreign vine across contested territory was just another Tuesday in a life spent refusing to explain itself.

The vine revived. The chaos of the Emu's wake — the non-repeating pattern, the fractal footfalls, the sheer aggressive unpredictability of its gait — woke it up. The lilac hum returned, stronger now, pointed southeast like a compass needle that had found magnetic north.

We passed through regions I didn't have names for. The Steppe gave way to scrubland, then to a zone where the crystal formations were visible at the surface — not the perfect tiling of the Bad Ground, but broken crystal, fractured geometry, places where the Static had tried to claim territory and failed. The Jacaranda's influence, I realized. The tree was already disrupting the lattice, already creating defects where life could grip.

The landscape changed color. The grey-brown of the Steppe shifted, became tinged with... I squinted against the wind. Was that purple? The Rómen-Sírë was strengthening, carrying moisture and scent from somewhere alive. Somewhere that shouldn't exist.

The Emu slowed. Not stopped — Emus don't stop for anything — but slowed to a canter, then a trot, then a walk. The spiral pattern tightened, became careful, precise. We were approaching something. Something the Emu recognized as significant.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 21: The Wall of Violet

The Jacaranda tree visible now - enormous, ancient, covered in cascades of violet blooms that pour from every branch like waterfalls of color. The Emu slows, spiral tightening, becoming careful and precise. Cooroo slides off, his claws touching actual soft grass. The Wedgies are far behind, unable to approach this chaos of life. Style: reveal moment, epic tree, violet color dominating, lush vegetation, arrival at destination.
-->

I looked ahead. The ground rose in a gentle slope, covered in vegetation that shouldn't exist — broad-leafed plants, flowering things, greenery that drank deep and grew tall. And at the top of the slope, visible now, impossible now:

A wall of violet.

The Jacaranda.

The Emu stopped. One final footfall, and then stillness — absolute, coiled, dangerous stillness. It lowered its neck, and I understood: this was my stop. The end of the line. The Emu had carried me as far as it would go, and now I had to walk the rest of the way alone.

I slid off. My claws touched grass — actual grass, soft and alive and nothing like the crystallized wasteland I'd left behind. I stumbled, caught myself, turned to thank the Emu.

It was already walking away.

"Wait — I didn't even — you didn't even tell me your —"

It didn't turn. Didn't pause. Just kept moving in that ground-eating stride, back toward the Steppe, back to its spirals, back to a life that had briefly intersected with mine and was now resuming its refusal to connect.

I called after it: "I'm going to remember this! When I tell the story, you're going to be in it! A hero! An Emu who —"

The Emu broke into a run. Not away from me, exactly, but definitely away from the conversation. I watched it go, diminishing into the grassland, until it was just a dot, then a memory, then the kind of thing you'd doubt if someone told you about it secondhand.

I turned around.

The Jacaranda filled the world.

### The Violet Zone

The Jacaranda was a heresy against the foundational logic of the Great Disconnection, a living break in the Structural Rigidity itself. It shouldn't have been here. It shouldn't have been alive. It shouldn't have been blooming.

It was enormous. Ancient. Its trunk was wider than the Silver Wattle had been — wider than any tree I'd ever seen. And it was covered in flowers. Not just covered — consumed. Cascades of violet blooms poured from every branch, spilling down in waterfalls of colour that caught Elen-Nico's light and held it, transformed it, sent it back into the world as something that wasn't gold and wasn't ember.

The pause between beats, made permanent. The concentrated sky, made wood.

The clearing around the tree was alive. Grass grew thick and soft. Flowers dotted the ground in colours I'd forgotten existed — yellow, white, the occasional brave red. The air was thick with scent, with moisture, with the weight of living things. It was like stepping into the past, into the Glory Days Mum remembered, into a world before the Static.

But the crystal was still here. I could see it at the edges of the clearing — hexagonal formations pushing upward like frost through soil, geometric intrusions that had tried to tile and failed. The Static was still trying to claim territory, still learning, still iterating. But it was stopped. Blocked. The Jacaranda's roots — shallow, wide, spreading laterally in patterns that never repeated — broke the lattice, created defects, made the ground too rough for perfect tiling.

I walked forward. My claws sank into soil that was soft, loamy, alive. The vine in my grip hummed — not pulled anymore, but matched, synchronized, finding its frequency in the tree's resonance.

The Jacaranda didn't speak as I approached. Trees don't, not in words. But it was aware. I could feel it — the weight of attention, the focused presence of something that had been waiting.

I reached the trunk. The bark was smooth, grey-brown, foreign. Nothing like the Silver Wattle's rough gold. I raised the Morning Glory vine — wilted now, barely alive, but the root ball was intact, still carrying the memory in its cells.

"I brought you something," I said, and my voice, though quiet, was clear. "It's the last living piece of the Silver Wattle's memory. The stories call the Morning Glory a parasite, a water-thief from the Glory Days. But this one... this one is a survivor."

The Jacaranda said nothing. The wind moved through its branches, making the violet blooms sway, but that was just physics. Wasn't it?

"But this one survived. When everything else was dying, when the Silver Wattle went crystal and the Rosellas scattered and the world started forgetting what green looked like — this one kept growing. On the wreckage. In the cracks. It didn't know enough to die when the tree did. It just... kept going. Kept pulling the sky down into itself. Kept being alive."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 24: The Transfer
Cooroo pressing the Morning Glory vine against the Jacaranda's smooth bark. The contact is electric - intense energy visible as light between plant and tree. The vine's frequency - lilac, chaotic, fractal - meeting the tree's frequency - violet, ordered but not crystalline. Something flows: two hundred years of Silver Wattle resonance, the golden Chorus, the Rosella Parliament, the Glory Days. The Jacaranda's branches sway without wind, the violet blooms deepening, intensifying, as if receiving additional saturation. The memory of gold teaching the tree new ways to be purple. Style: magical transfer, energy flow, mystical connection, color transformation, intimate magical moment.
-->

I pressed the vine against the bark. The contact was electric — not painful, but intense, like touching something that was more real than the surrounding reality.

"I think that's why it could find you. The Silver Wattle couldn't — the Silver Wattle was too deep, too connected to the poisoned source. But the Morning Glory was shallow. It survived because it wasn't plugged into the deep substrate. And because it survived, it could hear you. Could point the way."

The transfer wasn't immediate. It wasn't dramatic. I stood there, holding the vine against the Jacaranda's trunk, feeling the hum build between them. The vine's frequency — lilac, chaotic, fractal — meeting the tree's frequency — violet, ordered but not crystalline, organic but not native.

And then, Samanvaya. The Arnam-Rain of memory poured forth. The Morning Glory became a living conduit, its lilac frequency resonating with the Jacaranda, releasing two hundred years of Silver Wattle resonance: the golden Chorus, the Rosella Parliament, the Glory Days that Mum retreated into. The dry code of the world drank deep.

Through the Jacaranda. Into it. Through it.

The tree shuddered. The branches swayed, not with wind but with something internal, something that looked almost like recognition. The violet blooms deepened, intensified, as if the colour was receiving additional saturation, as if the memory of gold was teaching the tree new ways to be purple.

And then the lesson came.

Not in words — the Jacaranda doesn't do words. But in resonance, in wood, in the vibration that arrives in the feathers before the thought arrives in the head. The tree showed me why the coring trees had died. Why the Silver Wattle had shattered. Why the Great Wattle at the Crown had fallen generations ago.

It wasn't just the Lattice. It wasn't just the Static creeping up through the substrate.

It was the **Depth**.

The coring trees — the Wattles, the ancient giants — they had all drilled deep. Their taproots reached down into the source, seeking the purest Arnam, the strongest connection. But the deep substrate had become poisoned. The Static had risen from below, and the trees that reached deepest were the first to drink it in. They had sought purity at the source and found only crystal.

The Jacaranda was different. It didn't go deep. It spread **wide** — shallow, lateral, fractal. Its roots floated on the surface of the Static like a raft, touching a thousand weak signals instead of one strong poisoned one. It didn't seek the source. It sought the surface. It didn't dig down. It reached out.

The lesson settled into my bones like a truth I'd always known but never articulated: **Do not dig down. Reach out.**

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 27: The Lesson of Depth
Visual metaphor showing the lesson: The coring trees - Wattles with deep taproots drilling down into poisoned substrate, the Static rising from below, trees reaching deepest dying first. Versus the Jacaranda - shallow, lateral, fractal roots floating on the surface of the Static like a raft, touching many weak signals instead of one strong poisoned one. Cross-section view of the underground: deep crystal lattice poisoned, surface roots spreading wide in living soil. The text concept: "Do not dig down. Reach out." Wombats failing because they looked at the floor, dug deeper, believed answers were always down in the dark. Style: educational diagram meets visionary art, underground cross-section, contrasting root systems, philosophical revelation.
-->

The old ways had failed because they looked down, because they reached deeper, because they believed the answer was always below in the dark. But the world was dying from below. The Static was rising. And the only way to survive was to spread wide, to touch many, to build connections across the surface rather than plunging into the poisoned depths.

And then the vision came.

It wasn't a memory of the past. It was a projection of the future. The Jacaranda showed me the world not as it was, but as it could be.

I saw the **Fractal Rainforest**.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 25: The Vision - Fractal Rainforest
The vision of the Fractal Rainforest - the Jacaranda's projection of what could be. A violet canopy spreading, interlocking, creating a ceiling that blocks the harsh glare of Elen-Nico. Light filters down soft and diffuse, the killing fire of the Static dispersed into life. Moisture trapped in micro-clouds beneath the leaves, hanging like breath. Ancient ferns thriving in gaps between crystal tiles, their roots finding Compassion Gaps. Abundance through Dispersion - the Static not gone but broken, fractalized, turned from laser into rainbow. A world where life and crystal coexist through width, not depth. Style: visionary landscape, violet canopy, dappled light, utopian ecosystem, hope made visible.
-->

I saw the violet canopy spreading, interlocking, creating a ceiling that blocked the harsh glare of the Star. I saw the light filtering down, soft and diffuse, creating a twilight where the killing fire of the Static was dispersed into life. I saw moisture trapped in micro-clouds beneath the leaves, hanging in the air like breath. I saw ancient ferns — the ones that had been dying in the open — thriving in the gaps between crystal tiles, their roots finding the Compassion Gaps that the Jacaranda created.

It was a vision of **Abundance**. The Static wasn't gone — it was still there, the bone of the world — but it was broken, fractalized, turned from a laser into a rainbow.



Not the Primes. Not the Kangaroos bouncing on the hard ground, or the Koalas selling silence, or the Platypus vanishing into the paradox. I saw the **New World**.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 26: The Five Shapes
The vision of five abstract shapes moving through violet gloom in the Fractal Rainforest - not clear, not defined, but present. A digger of tunnels reaching sideways. A runner spiraling through chaos. A watcher at the edges. A carrier limping but moving. A screamer with pink and grey feathers. Five forms that together make a shelter. In the shadows beyond, diminished shapes of the old powers wandering, seeking refuge. Style: abstract visionary art, violet atmosphere, dreamlike composition, symbolic figures, new order emerging.
-->

And in the violet gloom, something moved — not forms, not creatures, but possibilities. A pressure in the earth, reaching sideways. A disturbance in the air, refusing pattern. A watching at the edges, where the light failed. A weight being carried, though by what I could not see. And a sound, rising, holding everything in vibration.

Five presences. Five resonances. Five notes that together made a chord.

Beyond them, at the edge of seeing, older harmonies faded — the great leaps, the deep silences, the swimming-between — all diminished now, their music threading through shadows. The forest did not reject them. It simply grew around them, offering shade where once they had offered shelter. A becoming-small. A resting. A waiting to be found.

*You are not here to fix the Song, Cooroo,* the tree vibrated. *You are here to scream the Truth.*

*The map stops here. But the world doesn't.*

I sat down in the grass. My wings were done. My claws were cramped. My skull chambers were ringing with frequencies I didn't have names for.

"So," I said to the tree. "What now?"

The Jacaranda didn't answer. Trees don't give instructions. They just grow, and bloom, and break the lattice, and hold the dirt together. But I understood.

I wasn't here to fix the Chorus. I was here to assemble the Kappa Mu.

I didn't know what that meant yet. I didn't know who they were, or how to find them. But the vision was clear. Wombat. Emu. Dingo. Wallaby. Galah.

I would find them. I would scream the truth until they heard me.

But first, I was going to take a very long nap.

The grass was soft. The air smelled of violet and possibility. And somewhere above, the Wedgies circled, waiting, calculating, but unable to approach the chaos of the Jacaranda's fractal roots.

I closed my eyes. The three-part vibration hummed in my skull chambers, the resonance of a world that was still, impossibly, alive.

Tomorrow, I would scream again. Tomorrow, I would find the others. Tomorrow, the Kappa Mu would begin.

But today, today I slept.
