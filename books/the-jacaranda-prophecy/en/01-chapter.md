### The Silent Galah

Here's something that shouldn't be possible: a Galah who can't scream.

I know. It's like saying "a river that can't flow" or "an emu that can't stare at you until you want to apologise for existing." Galahs scream. That's the whole deal. Other species have their talents — wombats dig, dingoes run, kookaburras laugh at things that aren't funny — but we scream. We scream the way the sun comes up: every day, no apologies, and usually before anyone's ready for it.

My name's Cooroo. I'm a juvenile, which means my wings are too short, my chambers are too big, and my mum reckons I got the loud gene from both sides of the family, which she says in a voice that's half proud and half "what have we done."

The Galahs call it the Noble Noise — Laica Róma. Not just screaming. Screaming is what you do when you're startled. The Noble Noise is what you do when you mean it: a call thrown outward that hits the world and comes back carrying information. You scream at a cliff-face and the echo tells you how far. You scream at a tree and the return tells you whether the wood is alive or dead, resonant or crystal. You scream at the swell and the whole world answers — every surface, every ridge, every root-threaded slope sending back a version of your voice changed by what it touched. The Noble Noise goes out as sound. It comes back as data. That's the deal. That's the covenant between a Galah and the world: you give it noise, it gives you knowledge.

IMAGE PROMPT: The Failed Scream
Close-up of Cooroo with his beak wide open at the swell - the moment when every Galah in Hún Nico screams at Elen-Nico. But from his beak comes only a ghost, a whisper, the shape of a scream without the sound. Visualized as faint wisps of pinkish air instead of the bold resonance other Galahs emit. His crest is half-raised in effort, his eyes show confusion and fear. Background shows other distant Galahs screaming properly toward the center star. The light is the bright gold of the swell phase. Mood: shame, isolation, the wrongness of silence. Style: emotional character moment, soft lighting, visible breath/vapor trails.
-->

Three weeks ago, I opened my beak at the swell — the moment the pulse brightens, when every Galah in Hún Nico screams — and nothing came out.

Well — not nothing. Something came out. But it was the ghost of a scream. The shape without the guts. Like blowing through a trumpet and getting a whisper.

I haven't told Mum. She's got enough quiet of her own.

### A Hollow Heart

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The World of Hún Nico
Wide landscape view of Hún Nico, a heart-shaped world viewed from the inside surface. The ground curves upward in all directions, creating a bowl-like interior that rises to meet at a distant geometric center. Elen-Nico hangs at the heart's center - a brilliant golden star radiating warm light in every direction. The inner surface is dotted with forests, ridges, and winding valleys. Another curved landmass is visible overhead, lit from the opposite side by the same star. Fantasy world-building, epic scale, impossible geometry, soft atmospheric perspective, luminous lighting.
-->

I should tell you about the world, because the world is shaped wrong and it matters.

Hún Nico is a heart. Not a metaphor. An actual heart-shaped world, and we live on the inside. The old stories say it's shaped like the heart of the Tall-Ones — the giants who appear in dreams, enormous and strange. No one has ever seen a Tall-One awake. But every creature in Hún Nico has dreamed of them — vague shapes, vast and sorrowful, and the weight of their caring pressing down like weather. We live inside their heart.

The ground curves up. The centre is Elen-Nico — the Star — hanging 140 kilometres above everything, radiating golden light in every direction. It pulses. Not steadily, not like a clock — like a heart. It swells bright, holds, dims, holds. And in the pause between beats — five minutes, maybe less, when the light is neither gold nor ember — the whole world goes lilac.

I stay awake for the pause. I've never been able to sleep through it.

### The Silver Wattle

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Cooriki on the Eucalyptus Branch
An adult Galah with dusty, unkempt feathers sits motionless on a thin Eucalyptus branch, staring into the void where the great Silver Wattle once stood. Her posture is slumped, crest flat, eyes distant and unfocused. Behind her, empty space where the magnificent tree should be - just a pale stump visible in the distance. The branch she's on looks thin and insignificant compared to the missing tree. Light filters through sparse Eucalyptus leaves. Mood: catatonic grief, internal retreat, absence, the grey of lost memory. Style: somber, muted colors, soft focus background, emotional portrait.
-->

Mum's name is Cooriki and she used to be the Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony, which is a massive deal if you're a Galah and means absolutely nothing if you're not. She could read the air like a map — knew the Andunë-Sírë (Western Air Flow) from the Rómen-Sírë (Eastern Air Flow), could find the Yá of a thermal by the way the dust spiraled below. She could throw a swell-call that rode the Halla-Hwë — the wind gradient — up through three atmospheric layers and came back carrying data from each. Her scream was so good the wombats used it to calibrate their tunnel acoustics, though they'd never admit that because wombats don't admit things — they "note observations" and "file findings" and generally pretend they worked it all out themselves.

Now she sits on a branch of a Eucalyptus — not even a proper tree, just a tree that's a tree and nothing else — and stares at the place where the **Silver Wattle** used to stand. Twenty-one days she's been doing this. I bring her seeds. Fat ones, dark shells, because she won't bother cracking anything that takes effort. She eats when I bring them. Drinks when it rains. That's it.

On the ninth day, she said one thing.

"The Noble Noise has no return. It just goes."

I didn't get it. I do now. But at the time, all I heard was my mum's voice sounding the way the stump sounds when I tap it with my claw: hollow, and warm, and done being what it used to be.

When I was very small — young enough that I thought the Silver Wattle would always be there, the way you think everything enormous and old will always be there — the high branches were full of Rosellas. Rainbow plumage, all of it. Reds and blues and greens and yellows, and when Elen-Nico caught them they looked like stained glass had learned to sing. The Rosellas had something up there — a Song, the Parliament's braided voice that was somehow also the world's health report rendered in harmonics. I was a fledgling Galah roosting on the lower branches. I didn't understand what things the Chorus told you. I just knew it was happening up there, this immense careful thing, and the tree amplified it and sent it out and the whole ridge woke up to it every morning.

Mum would do her frequency checks, throwing swell-calls into the canopy, listening to the return. Her feathers were content.

I asked her once why we stayed — this was before the fall, back when the Rosellas were still leaving one by one, matching their bit of the Song to a simpler tone coming up through the wood, and we could all feel the canopy going quiet.

"Because it's a tree," Mum said, like I'd asked why water was wet. "And we're birds. Where else would we be?"

"The Rosellas left."

"The Rosellas had a covenant. Covenants break. We're just here because we're here. You can't break that."

She said it with the total confidence of someone who has never needed philosophy because common sense has always been enough.

"Also," she added, fixing my neck-feathers the way she does when she's about to say something that'll take me years to understand, "we Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we."

I laughed. I was a fledgling. It was the kind of thing mums say.

I'm not laughing now.

### The Vigil

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Galah Colony Scattered
Various groups of Galahs flying away from the Eastern Ridge to different destinations. Cooroo watches them go from the stump, his wings too young for the distance. Style: migration, dispersal, multiple destinations, youth left behind, community fracturing.
-->

After the Wattle fell, the other Galahs scattered. The Callers went south to the Canopy Remnant — Aldar Lemnë, the Trees Remaining — scattered clusters of surviving Eucalyptus and lesser Wattles south-east of the ridge. The kind of trees that are to a proper resonant tree what tomato sauce is to a tomato: technically related, spiritually embarrassing. The Fliers went further — some to the Windbreak Cliffs, Ramba Súrëa, where the old roosting caves are pockmarked in sandstone too rough for the lattice to tile. Some flew even further south, toward the Lone Borows, that unstable, transitional zone where the Emu Steppe, Burnt Scrub, and Crystal Plains all bleed into one another.

I stayed. My wings were too young for the distance, and I was too stubborn to say so. Mum once screamed at a thunderstorm for forty minutes because it interrupted her swell-call. The storm moved on. Mum didn't. Stubbornness: it's a family thing.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Shattered Silver Wattle
The wreckage of an enormous ancient tree shattered into perfect hexagonal crystal fragments. Massive pale wood splinters have fractured into geometric hexagonal prisms, each face meeting at exactly 120 degrees. Some fragments are small as pebbles, others large as boulders. The break-face where the stump meets the air shows warm, hollow wood still faintly humming with lost resonance. Background: the Eastern Ridge landscape curving upward. Light: ember-red low phase of Elen-Nico. Style: detailed fantasy art, crystalline textures, tragic beauty, sharp geometric patterns contrasting with organic tree rings.
-->

So now it's me and the stump.

The stump is enormous — wide, pale, fractured right down the middle with a deep split that runs from the crown to the base. The horizontal cut is jagged with quartz-like breakages where the crystal lattice snapped under tension.

The Silver Wattle wasn't cut down. It broke.

The sound. That's the bit I can't escape. It shattered. The crystal cracked like thunder, each fracture echoing across the ridge, bouncing off the shell-walls, filling the whole Eastern Ridge with the sound of something enormous and crystalline breaking. Every Galah for fifty kilometres heard it. Every wombat in their tunnels felt it in their paws. And my voice went quiet too — not because the silence was wrong, but because that thunder was the answer. The Chorus had ended. The Lattice had won. What was left to scream?

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Cooroo in the Wreckage
Cooroo walking through the wreckage of the Silver Wattle, surrounded by hexagonal crystal fragments. He holds one perfect hexagonal prism in his claw, examining the 120-degree angles with obsessive precision. A thin line of blood runs from his claw where the crystal edge has cut him. The blood sits on the crystal surface without soaking in, beading like water on glass. Style: intimate character moment, sharp crystal edges, blood on perfection, emotional numbness.
-->

It shattered into pieces that had no right to exist. Wood doesn't fracture into hexagons. Wood splinters, tears, rips along the grain in jagged, angry lines. This wasn't wood anymore. It was something wearing wood's shape.

I walked through the wreckage on the first day. The fragments were everywhere — some as small as my claw, others big as my whole body. Each one a perfect hexagonal prism. I picked one up. The edge was sharper than any beak, any talon. It cut me before I realized I'd gripped too tight. I bled on the crystal, and the blood ran off it without soaking in, like water off glass.

I checked the angles. I don't know why I checked. Maybe because if I could just verify that the geometry held, that 120 degrees was really 120 degrees, then this would make sense. It would be physics. Tragedy with rules. But the numbers didn't help. The fragments were perfect. The tree was gone. Perfection had won, and I was standing in the wreckage counting angles while my mother went catatonic on a branch.

The break-face where the stump meets the air is still faintly warm. Not alive-warm. The other kind. The warmth that stays in a grave after the body has been in it for a while — the earth remembering heat, not the heat of life. The Silver Wattle had been conducting resonance through this wood for two hundred years, and the wood hasn't quite worked out that the song is over. It hums sometimes, when the wind hits it right. A dead note. A crystal frequency where there used to be gold.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Cooroo Roosting on the Stump
Cooroo roosting on the uneven, hard surface of the Silver Wattle stump at night. The dim phase - Elen-Nico low and ember-red. He is alone, stubborn, refusing to let the vigil end. Style: night scene, ember-red lighting, solitude, stubborn hope, uncomfortable perch.
-->

I roost on the stump. Not because it's comfortable — it's hard, uneven, nothing like the branches I grew up on. Not because it's the right height — I'm a Galah, I can roost anywhere. I stay because leaving would mean admitting it's over.

Someone has to keep the vigil. Even if the vigil is pointless. Even if the tree is never coming back, and the Chorus is never going to resolve, and the world is just going to keep crystallising until there's nothing left but hexagons and silence.

So I stay. One more day. One more night. One more dawn, watching the sun rise over the Bad Grounds, painting the crystal slope in colours that don't belong to living things.

### The Bad Grounds

Beyond the stump, the ridge drops away into the Bad Grounds.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Organic/Crystal Boundary
Extreme close-up of the boundary between living soil and the Bad Grounds. On one side: tangled roots, insects, moisture, organic mess - fractal, rough, alive. On the other: perfect hexagonal crystal cells, tessellating infinitely, prismatic, dead. The line between them is ragged, messy, still fighting. Style: macro photography style, microscopic warfare, organic vs geometric textures.
-->

It's been there my whole life. By the time I hatched, the Bad Grounds was just a fact — the sheen on the western slope, the place you don't land, the thing the adults glance at and look away from the way you look away from a scar on someone's face.

Hexagons.

Not scattered. Not random. Interlocking. A sickening tessellation of near-hexagons, their angles subtly wrong, their sizes varying just enough to be unsettling. It's a lattice that mimics order, repeating with flaws that feel more like a disease than a pattern. The variation isn't the organic mess of life; it's the cold, calculated deviation of a machine with a flaw in its code. The lattice doesn't try. It expands.

If you look at one hexagon — just one, close up, eye level — it's almost beautiful. The surface catches Elen-Nico's light and splits it into prismatic arcs. Each face is a tiny mirror showing a fractured version of the world. But the beauty is wrong. It's the beauty of a skeleton, all structure and no flesh. The geometry has answered the question "how do I exist?" and forgotten to ask "why?"

If you look at the slope — the half-tiled, still-failing, not-yet-finished slope — it's worse than perfection. It's a promise. The lattice isn't done. It hasn't arrived. It's arriving. Marching up the ridge one cell at a time, converting, transforming, promising that someday soon the whole ridge will be hexagons. The whole Eastern Shell. The whole heart.

The Dreaming — the living, show-up-every-morning, sing-the-ground-into-being work — costs everything. The lattice costs nothing. It tiles whether you're watching or not. And it doesn't need to finish to win. It just needs to keep trying. Forever. Which is exactly what it plans to do.

I stay away from the Bad Grounds. My feathers go flat every time I look at it, and a Galah who ignores his feathers is a Galah who walks into walls.

### The Underground

Here's what they told us: the Yellow Monsters came, and then the tree fell.

Which is true. Creatures had been seeing Yellow Monsters for seasons — those enormous spirits that flicker at the edge of your vision, shapes like arms swinging and jaws biting, the hallucinations that come when the Tall-Ones' dreaming presses too hard against the substrate. Every creature in Hún Nico knows what a Yellow Monster means: something bad is coming. You see one, you brace.

So when the tree fell, the story wrote itself: the Yellow Monsters did it. An external force. Something you can point at and scream at and blame. Stories are how Galahs deal with things. You scream the story at the sky and the sky takes it and you feel a tiny bit better.

Here's what actually happened: the wombats did it.

Yeah. I know.

The Yellow Monsters were real — the Tall-Ones' dreaming was pressing through. But the tree didn't die because of spirits. It died because of engineering. A series of well-intentioned decisions made underground over three seasons. You can't scream at a decision. Trust me. I've tried.

I could feel the wombats working through my claws. The vibrations changed — deeper, sharper, more regular. Their Grout, their strange, dead earth-glue, was being set in straight lines below us. Season after season. The ground under the Silver Wattle got quieter as they worked. The branches got harder. The bark cracked in lines that were too straight to be natural.

The lower leaves yellowed first. Not the warm gold of the Wattle bloom — a thin, papery yellow, the colour of something being emptied out. Mum ran her frequency checks every morning. I couldn't read the data yet but I could read her feathers, and her feathers said bad news.

"The return is changing," she said one morning. Most technical thing she'd ever said to me. Didn't explain. Didn't need to. I could feel it. The branch under my claws was harder. Denser. It rang when you tapped it, but it was the wrong ring — flat, pretty, useless crystal instead of the warm, living ring that carried data.

The blooms kept coming, though. Golden flowers, right on schedule. From a distance, the tree looked fine. You had to be close. You had to be a Galah on a lower branch with your claws on the bark, paying attention, to know the gold was a ghost.

Then it fell. And the silence of it took my voice with it.

### The Concentrated Sky

On the twenty-first morning, I saw the flower.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Morning Glory
A delicate Morning Glory vine growing at the ragged edge where crystalline Bad Grounds meets living soil. The vine is thin as wire with three bright green heart-shaped leaves. It climbs a fragment of the shattered Silver Wattle wood. At its top, a single trumpet-shaped flower blooms - the color of concentrated sky, lilac/violet, the exact shade of the pause between Elen-Nico's beats. The flower glows with an inner light against the grey hexagonal crystal background. Style: macro photography style, fantasy illustration, luminous petals, detailed texture, symbolic composition.
-->

I woke on the stump in the dim — the low ember phase, Elen-Nico resting between beats — and waited for the swell. And there it was.

Growing right at the edge of the Bad Grounds. Right where the dying met the living — not a clean line, nothing neat about it, just a ragged, messy tear in the earth where dirt and crystal were still fighting over who got to be the ground. The hexagons stopped here. Not because anything was stopping them. Because the soil was still too tangled, too rooty, too alive for the geometry to tile through. A few centimetres of organic mess holding back the pattern. The thinnest possible margin.

A vine. Thin as wire. Climbing a fragment of the shattered Wattle with the quiet stubbornness of a plant that had looked at its options, found them rubbish, and decided that up was the best available direction. Three heart-shaped leaves, so green against all that grey they looked like they were making a point.

Heart-shaped. In a heart-shaped world. I don't know if that means something. My feathers think it does.

And at the top, open to the swell:

A flower. Lilac.

My crest went up. I hadn't told it to. My crest has opinions and doesn't consult me.

The pause between beats. The held breath. Five minutes, maybe less, when Elen-Nico hasn't committed to the next pulse and the whole inner surface of Hún Nico — from the Crown down to the Gorge, every curve of the heart — goes lilac. Most creatures sleep through it. Galahs don't sleep through anything. And the swell is the moment we scream at, every cycle, every pulse, and the colour of the thing you scream at your whole life gets into you whether you mean it to or not. It settles in the feathers. It becomes the breast and the crest and the underwing. It becomes the colour that every other species calls "loud" and Galahs call "us."

The Morning Glory had caught that colour and was holding it open.

I hopped off the stump. Claws clicking on the crystal fragments — that clean, wrong, glassy sound, each hexagonal prism ringing at exactly the same pitch as the last — and then I reached the crack where the vine was growing and the sound changed. Soft. Uneven. The sound of a claw on dirt with things living in it.

I squatted in front of the flower.

The colour entered me through my feathers. It came in like light comes into a room when you open the curtains — not fast, not slow, just there, as if it had been waiting on the other side. It slid down my spine. It settled in the resonating chambers in my skull — the ones that had been empty for five weeks, the ones where my scream used to live — and they hummed. Barely. Like a wire that's just started carrying current and hasn't decided how much.

-->

The vine was growing on the Wattle. Not beside it. Not near it. On it. Its roots had found a crack in the crystal — a flaw, a defect, a spot where the hexagonal tessellation had broken just enough for a crumb of real dirt to lodge — and had threaded themselves into the dead tree's body. Using the wreckage as a trellis. Growing on the thing that had been killed by the crystal that the vine's own living roughness was, at the smallest scale, disrupting.

A living vine on a dead tree. Colour on crystal. Curve on hexagon.

And I understood something. Not in words — I'm a Galah, we don't do words — but in feathers. In the way the colour sat in my chambers and hummed.

Blue, squeezed hard enough, turns lilac. The sky, pushed into a space as small as a flower, shifts frequency. It doesn't break. It changes. Concentrated blue becomes violet. That's what lilac is. That's what Galahs are.

That's what the Morning Glory was showing me, in a trumpet of petals on a dead fragment of the last Silver Wattle on the Eastern Ridge:

The sky survives concentration. It just comes out a different colour.

### The Voice

I went back every morning for a week.

The flower opened at the swell. Closed at the dim. Opened the next morning slightly wider, slightly deeper, the stem slightly longer. Not the same flower repeated — the same idea repeated, with variations. Like the way Mum used to hum the same lullaby every night, and it was never quite the same because she was a day tireder and I was a day older and the dark outside was a different dark.

On the seventh morning, the vine spoke to me.

Not in words. In resonance. In the vibration that arrives in the feathers before the thought arrives in the head, and stays after the thought has gone, like the warmth left in a branch after the sun has moved on.

The signal came up through dead roots, through the living vine, through the stem, into the flower, out through the colour — the lilac, the concentrated sky — and into my feathers.

It was a direction. South-east. Far. Past the Ridge, past the Burnt Scrub, past the Gorge where living stone meets crystal, past everywhere my useless young wings could reach. Somewhere out there — somewhere on the curving inner surface of Hún Nico, where the world bends up and away and Elen-Nico's light arrives at different angles — the lattice was thin and the ground still held moisture and the old channels connected to something that was — impossibly, unaccountably — still growing.

Not a Wattle. The Wattles were all gone. This was different. Something that had no history in this soil. But it was alive, and it was rooted, and it was conducting a frequency through living wood that the vine could feel and my feathers could read.

A tree. With a violet bloom.

A Jacaranda.

The flower closed. The signal stopped.

I knew what I had to do. Not because I'd thought it through. Because my feathers told me, and my feathers had been right about the Bad Grounds and right about the flower and right about the hum in my chambers. I was done arguing with my feathers.

I screamed.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The First Scream
Cooroo on the Silver Wattle stump, beak wide open in a raw, cracked scream - his first sound in five weeks. Sound waves visualized radiating outward in jagged, ungraceful patterns - nothing like the Noble Noise, everything like raw determination.

Style: dramatic moment, dynamic composition, visualized sound, emotional breakthrough, dawn light.
-->

It was terrible. The worst scream in the history of Galah screaming — raw, cracked, graceless, a gate hinge in a cyclone. The sound of a juvenile bird with oversized chambers and no training standing on a dead stump, screaming at Elen-Nico because a flower had taught him that the sky, pushed hard enough, turns lilac — and lilac is the colour of everything that refuses to be grey.

It was also the first sound I'd made in five weeks.

It came from the chambers that had been empty — not broken, never broken, just waiting — and it filled the morning the way the flower's colour filled the crack: completely, gracelessly, and without caring one bit whether anyone thought it was beautiful.

Three hundred metres away, on her Eucalyptus branch, Mum's crest went up.

She didn't fly to me. Not yet. But she turned her head. First time she'd turned toward anything since the Silver Wattle fell.

She looked at me.

Just a bird turning her head on a branch. But I felt it from three hundred metres away through twenty-one days of silence, and it was the loudest thing I'd heard since the tree came down.
