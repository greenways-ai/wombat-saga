## Chapter One: The Morning Glory

The tunnels of Melborow had not seen morning in three thousand years, but the wombats remembered.

Hoebat pressed his nose against the cool stone wall of his burrow, feeling the faint vibration that meant the city was waking. Above him—far above, through strata of compacted earth and forgotten history—the sun was rising on a world the wombats had abandoned. But they had not forgotten. The Old Ways were written in their blood, in their instincts, in the very architecture of their underground civilization.

"Another day," Hoebat muttered to himself, "another thousand tonnes of earth to move."

He was an architect, officially. A designer of burrows, of tunnels, of the great hollow spaces where wombat civilization thrived. But unofficially—secretly—he was something else. A servant of the land. A keeper of the question.

*Are you servicing the land?*

The question had no answer in Melborow. Not anymore. The Five Sovereigns had seen to that with their Frequency, their Walls, their relentless Ledger that measured every wombat's worth in cubic meters moved and cubic meters stored.

Hoebat emerged from his personal burrow into the main thoroughfare of the Eastern Warren. The tunnel here was wide enough for ten wombats to walk abreast, which was fortunate because at this hour it needed to be. The morning commute had begun.

"Hoebat! Ho there, Hoebat!"

He turned to see Cooroo pushing through the crowd. Cooroo was young—barely out of training—but there was something in his eyes that Hoebat recognized. The same restless curiosity that had made Hoebat an architect instead of a digger, a questioner instead of a believer.

"Cooroo," Hoebat nodded. "You're early."

"I wanted to catch you before the Council meeting." Cooroo glanced around, lowering his voice. "I found something. In the western tunnels. Something... old."

Hoebat felt his pulse quicken. "How old?"

"Older than the Walls." Cooroo's eyes gleamed. "I think it's from before the Great Crystalisation."
