# Chapter 6 Revision: Pellaboo and Tallibat

*Expanded character development and the warning scene.*

## Insert after "The Dead Zones" section, before "Tuesday Afternoon"

### The Counting

Pellaboo had stopped counting her own footsteps in the tunnels. She'd started counting ours—mine and Tallibat's, the rhythm of our digging, the specific cadence of paws on clay she'd learned to read like a map.

"You walk differently down here," she told me once, while Tallibat was running his boring-probe through a new section. "In the Groves, you meander. You follow the root-lines. Down here you walk like you're listening for something."

"I am listening."

"I know. That's what I'm counting."

She never explained what the count was for. Pellaboo didn't explain things. She observed, she recorded, she kept her own counsel until she had enough data to say something true. She'd counted footsteps since she was seven—her mother's, first, then her own, then anyone who walked beside her for long enough to establish a pattern.

Tallibat had a pattern. He walked like someone who expected the ground to be level. Even in the Dead Zones, even after months of learning the feel, his body remembered the grid tunnels—straight lines, predictable substrate, the formula's promise that if you did it right, it would hold.

He was learning, though. I watched him in the fourth month—he'd stopped using the boring-probe as a walking stick and started using it the way Pellaboo used her counts: a check, not a crutch. He'd probe once, listen to the return, then adjust his stance before stepping. Small thing. Easy to miss. But Pellaboo missed nothing.

"He's down to three probes per section," she told me, while Tallibat was ahead with the instruments. "Used to be eight."

"Does that mean something?"

"Means he's learning to feel it first. The probe's just confirmation now."

She looked at him the way she looked at complex arithmetic—not with sentiment, but with recognition that something was working correctly. I didn't understand what was happening between them until the fifth month, when the Council announced a maintenance survey of the Groves margin and Agathaboo mentioned, casually, that Pellaboo had refused to file a witness statement about our tunnel locations.

"She could have," Agathaboo said. "They offered her father a water-rights exemption."

"She said no?"

"She said she didn't know anything worth filing."

Pellaboo knew everything. She'd mapped most of the forward sections herself, counting our combined footsteps, calculating distances in a system she'd invented that only she understood. She knew exactly where we'd been, how deep, how the tunnels connected to the old substrate faults.

She'd looked at a water-rights exemption and then at Tallibat, who was still learning to feel the earth before he probed it, and she'd said: I don't know anything.

That was when I understood what the counting was. It wasn't data. It was a language she was building, and Tallibat was the only one who'd learned to speak it back.

### The Formula and the Feel

Tallibat brought his father's field book once. Not to use—he never used his father's materials for our work. He brought it to show us what we weren't doing.

"This is the assessment method," he said, opening the book on a dry section of tunnel floor. The pages were full of grids—coordinate systems, tolerance margins, risk matrices. "Every tunnel in Sector 3 gets evaluated on this."

"Our tunnels aren't in Sector 3," Barnabat said.

"I know. I want to show you why."

He pointed to a column labeled *Substrate Confidence Index*. "This number comes from probe density. More probes per meter, higher confidence. Maximum efficiency at eight probes per meter."

"We use three," Pellaboo said.

"I know. That's what I want to show you."

He turned pages until he found a chart—incident rates plotted against probe density. The curve showed what he expected: more probes, fewer incidents. Up to a point. Then the curve flattened.

"Look here," he said. "Past twelve probes per meter. No improvement. But the formula requires eight minimum because twelve is 'computationally impractical.'"

"So?" Barnabat asked.

"So the formula accepts inefficiency. It knows there's no gain past a certain density, but it doesn't ask *why*. It just sets eight and moves on."

He closed the book.

"Pellaboo counts footsteps. Hoebat listens to the hum. I've been trying to combine them—the probe gives me the structure, but I'm learning to feel when the structure's wrong before the probe confirms it. That's not in the formula. The formula doesn't have a category for 'feels wrong.'"

"What does it have?" I asked.

"Deflection tolerances. Moisture gradients. Load-bearing coefficients." He paused. "Everything except the thing that actually tells you whether the earth wants to hold."

He left the book with us that night. Never asked for it back. It sat in the Dead Zones for three weeks before Barnabat returned it to Tallibat's burrow, unread after the first night—there was nothing in it we didn't already know, and everything in it we were learning to ignore.

## Replace the "Tuesday Afternoon" section with the following

### Tuesday Afternoon

The North-West Corridor springline failed on a Tuesday afternoon.

Category 2. Quarterly monitoring required. Never escalated. I'd read the flag a dozen times in the library records, noted the date range, done the arithmetic on how long it had been sitting at Category 2 without becoming Category 1. I'd even thought, once, about filing something—an anonymous concern, a note left in the Maintenance Request box.

I had not filed anything. I was fifteen and had enough sense to know what happened to unnotched wombats who put their name on institutional concerns.

Tallibat and Pellaboo had gone ahead to the forward section. That was their role—Tallibat running instruments on the new ground, Pellaboo reading beside him, her silent count keeping pace with his probe-work. They'd pushed further than the rest of us that afternoon, into a section where the earth was shallower above and the spring load had been pressing down longest.

I'd meant to go with them. Barnabat had a question about a wall reading and I'd stopped to look at it—a section where the Grout above showed hairline fractures, cosmetic, nothing the academy would flag but worth noting.

That was the difference. That was all it was.

The sound came first.

Not the collapse itself—the warning. The earth speaking the way Cornelibat had described: the grain-running crack that sounds like failure but is actually healing, except louder, magnified by the tunnel geometry, multiplied by the load above shifting all at once.

Pellaboo heard it.

She'd been counting—she was always counting—and the count had just reached a number that meant something to her, something wrong about the rhythm of the space, when the quality changed. The tunnel hum she'd learned to read like language suddenly had a grammar she'd never heard before.

"Tallibat," she said.

He was bent over the probe, documenting a moisture reading. "One more meter."

"Now."

The word had a weight. He looked up—saw her face, the particular stillness that meant Pellaboo had calculated something and the result was not good.

"What?"

"The springline. It's moving."

They heard it then together—the deep tidal patient thing they'd both learned to listen for, except now it was patient in the way a held breath is patient, pressure looking for release, and they were standing directly above where it would release.

Pellaboo did not hesitate. She grabbed Tallibat's shoulder—her count had already told her the distance to the nearest cross-passage, the one we'd dug three weeks ago that connected to the main Dead Zone tunnel—and she pulled him toward it.

"HOEBAT!"

Her voice carried differently than his would have. She'd learned the acoustics of these tunnels the way she learned everything: by counting, by measuring, by knowing exactly where sound would travel and where it would die. She aimed her voice at the junction where the forward section met our main tunnel, the spot where the geometry would carry it.

"BARNABAT! GET BACK!"

Tallibat added his voice—deeper, trained in the Cathedral's resonant chambers, loud enough to hurt:

"THE SPRING! IT'S GOING!"

They were running now. Pellaboo's count operating in reverse, telling her how many steps to the cross-passage, how many seconds before the geometry committed, whether they could clear the forward section before the load redistributed through the grid tunnels above.

Fifteen steps. Twelve. Eight.

The springline went.

Not a collapse—not immediately. The load redistributed through the grid tunnels above the Dead Zones first, the Grout-sealed sections, rigid and formula-certified, unable to flex, passing the shock downward. Tallibat felt it through his paws—a vibration he'd never felt in grid tunnels, too complex, too organic, the earth not behaving like the formula said it should.

"Keep moving!" Pellaboo shouted.

They were almost at the cross-passage. Almost clear. The forward section—the ground they'd been standing on thirty seconds ago—took the first load. The crown cracked. Not a grain-running crack. An against-grain crack. A warning that had come too late.

Behind them, the geometry committed.

### The Rescue (Revised)

Barnabat was trapped under a collapsed crown section twenty metres behind where they'd been. Not his voice I heard—the earth's translation of his movement. Small, frantic pressure against material that hadn't committed yet to its new geometry.

Pellaboo's warning had carried. We'd heard it—Barnabat and I—heard "GET BACK" and the terror in her voice that Pellaboo never showed, and we'd started moving, but Barnabat had been closer to the compromised wall and the shock had knocked him down, and the crown had come down on his legs.

I put my paws on the collapsed wall and listened.

Not for Barnabat. For the earth.

You have a window in a collapse before the geometry commits. After it commits the earth has decided, and digging against a decision is how you find yourself under the same problem. You read the direction of the stress. Find the place where the material is still making up its mind.

Pellaboo had tried to tell us. She'd counted the tunnel, measured the acoustic properties, known exactly where to shout so we'd hear. She'd given us that.

Fourteen minutes. Barnabat pulled clear. Secondary collapse starting behind us.

I didn't know about Tallibat and Pellaboo yet. I knew they'd shouted. I knew they'd been ahead. I knew the forward section had taken the load.

I carried Barnabat out through the cross-passage—the one Pellaboo had been running for, the one she'd almost reached—and I didn't let myself think about whether they'd made it, whether her count had been accurate enough, whether they'd cleared the geometry in time.

I thought about it later. In the Principal's office. In the silence after the Auditor left. I thought about Pellaboo's voice—precise, aimed, using everything she'd learned about these tunnels to put the warning exactly where we could hear it.

She'd known. She'd counted the distance, calculated the time, known exactly how close it would be. And she'd used her breath to shout for us instead of running faster.

Tallibat too. He'd added his voice—deeper, louder, the Cathedral training he'd brought with him turned to warning instead of performance.

They'd been running for the cross-passage. Almost there. The crown cracked behind them, then the geometry committed, and the forward section that had been their destination became their burial.

### The Witness Statement (Additional Context)

The statement Barnabat signed didn't mention the warning. It described me as "instigator," as having "directed subjects into an unsound forward section." It didn't say that Pellaboo and Tallibat had shouted for us to get back. It didn't say they'd been running for safety, almost clear, giving us time we wouldn't have had.

I understood why Barnabat omitted that part. The warning made them heroes. Heroes complicate the narrative of negligence. Heroes suggest the forward section was compromised before we entered it, that someone should have known, that Category 2 was a lie.

The statement reduced them to victims. Reduced all of us to a simple chain of command: I led, they followed, the tunnel collapsed.

It wasn't true. Pellaboo led herself—by her counts, her measurements, her knowledge of exactly where sound would travel. Tallibat followed her lead, learning finally that the formula was less reliable than the feel, that Pellaboo's counting was more accurate than his probe.

They'd been partners. In the tunnels, in whatever was happening between them, in the final seconds when they'd used their voices to warn us instead of saving their breath for running.

The Tally-stone didn't have a category for that. The stone was perfectly clear. It recorded: Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation.

It didn't record: They shouted. They ran. They almost made it. They gave us time.

I carry that. Along with everything else—the charge, the expulsion, the look on Cornelibat's face when he agreed with me calling him a coward—I carry the sound of Pellaboo's voice aimed exactly where it needed to go, and Tallibat's deeper echo, and the silence after the geometry committed.

They were almost clear. Her count had been accurate. The cross-passage was right there.

Almost.
