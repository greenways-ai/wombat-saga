### The Bowl That Sings

My father told stories the way other wombats breathed — constantly, without thinking, as necessary and unnoticed as heartbeat. He told them while making tea, while repairing the burrow wall, while watching the eucalyptus move against the distant Glow-Panels. He never announced them. They simply arrived, like weather, settling into the space between sentences.

I was eight when he told me about Morribat.

It was evening in the Groves. Cornelibat had made tea — real tea, from the surface farms — and we sat at the burrow's entrance watching the city glow in the distance. I had already heard dozens of his stories by then: the Seamstress of Sector Four, the Root That Grew Wrong, the Inspector Who Counted Twice. They formed the background of my childhood, the way other families had music or silence.

"Come here, Hoebat. Sit," he said. "The eucalyptus is moving tonight—see how the branches draw patterns against the Glow-Panels? The city thinks it owns the light, but the trees remember older movements."

He settled with his tea, not looking at me, looking at the trees. I pressed my paws flat against the clay floor, the way I always did now, the way that made Agathaboo smile and Cornelibat go quiet.

"I knew a wombat once—Morribat was her name, though names are such small things to hang a person on. She worked the eastern deep grid three generations back, before your grandfather wore his first claw-guard. Officially, she was a Root-Counter. The guild paid her per prediction: tell us where the water will come, and we will reinforce before it comes."

He sipped. The tea steamed in the cool air.

"She was always right. They did not ask how. The how was her business, you see, and business that delicate cannot survive examination by committee. What mattered was the Tally—she predicted, they reinforced, the tunnels held. Clean accounting."

He put down the tea and looked at the trees. The eucalyptus moved in patterns I was too young to read.

"After she died—and she did die, as we all must, though some of us choose our moments more carefully than others—they tried to replicate her method. Four senior Root-Counters. Three certified engineers. A High Auditor from the Cathedral with a Tally-stone so fresh it had not yet learned to decide things. They interviewed everyone she had ever worked with."

He smiled, slightly. I watched his profile against the darkening sky.

"Nobody could explain the method. Morribat had never explained it. She sat in the tunnel. She listened. She told them where the water would be. The official report, filed sixty years after her death—sixty years, mind you, of tunnels that held—described her predictions as 'statistically significant anecdotal evidence.'"

Silence. The eucalyptus moved. The city glowed in the distance, believing itself the only light.

"The tunnels she identified are still there. Maintained. Not failed. All the tunnels the four senior Root-Counters approved during the same period have been replaced at least twice."

He picked up his tea again. "Drink your tea, Hoebat. It is getting cold."

IMAGE PROMPT 1: Cornelibat Storytelling
Night in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat sits with his tea, looking out at the eucalyptus. Young Hoebat (eight years old) sits on the clay floor with his paws pressed flat against it, listening. The burrow is warm — real wood-light, clay walls packed by paw, no Safety Grout. Outside, the surface air moves through the stringybark. The underground city is a distant glow. The atmosphere is intimate, unhurried, the specific warmth of a story being told for the dozenth time and still meaning something. Style: domestic, warm, father-son, organic textures, night.
-->

I pressed my paws to the burrow floor the next morning and tried to listen for water.

I didn't find any.

But I felt something — a quality I didn't have a word for yet. Deep. Tidal. Patient. Not quite sound. Not quite pressure. Something that had been there before my grandfather dug his first tunnel and would be there after the last Tally-stone cracked.

I kept trying.

Cornelibat watched me without comment. He had stories for this too — the Apprentice Who Listened Too Hard, the Clay That Sang Before the Flood — but he didn't tell them. He just let me lie there with my paws against the earth, learning to feel what the stories had been pointing toward all along.

### The Margin

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Eucalyptus Groves
The Groves margin — the transitional zone between Melborow's grid tunnels and the surface. Stringybark trees with roots pressing into dark blue clay. A cluster of unregistered burrows, dug by paw, no Grout. Washing on a line between two trees. Juvenile wombats playing in the clay — one of them (Hoebat) lying with his ear against the ground while the others roll and dig and chase each other. The city visible in one direction, sky in the other. Unofficial, unnotched, alive. Style: community, organic architecture, margin life, warmth and scrappiness.
-->

The Eucalyptus Groves ran along the eastern margin of Melborow, in the zone the city had not yet decided what to do with. The official maps called it Transitional Zone 4. The wombats who lived there called it the Groves. The grid-kids who came out on weekends called it Unnotched Territory, which was accurate — none of the burrows here had Tally-registrations, which meant the Council didn't count them.

Cornelibat's burrow was three tunnels in from the stringybark line. Dark blue clay — the good kind, pre-formation, the kind that packs and holds without chemistry. Our walls had paw-prints in them. You could read the pressure-marks like a record of who built what and when. No Safety Grout. No grid-tunnel access.

Agathaboo had put a geologist's survey note on the wall — from the drainage assessment she'd run for the surface farms, which operated without Council permits because the rains came every year regardless of the application status. The geologist had written: *exceptionally stable load-bearing material, pre-formation period, undervalued by current assessment models.* She'd underlined *undervalued by current assessment models* in red.

The Council's assessment model put our address as: Unregistered. No Tally-value.

The wall and the Council did not agree on what our home was worth.

I grew up in it alongside Pellaboo, two burrows down — her dad ran the surface-access ladder, her mum made the best clay-pressed bread in the margin, and she herself could hold her breath longer than anyone in the Groves and mapped the clay in her head the way other kids memorized Grid routes. We played in the clay. We dug the way kids dig — without method, for the pleasure of it, following whatever the earth seemed to want.

I was the one who lay down and pressed my ear to the ground.

Pellaboo learned early that this was just something Hoebat did, the same way she had a thing about knowing which direction was north no matter how deep we went. We each had our thing. Mine just looked stranger because mine involved lying face-down in the dirt.

### Tallibat

-->

The grid-kids came to the margin on late-season weekends when the grid tunnels got warm and the families with Tally-notches wanted the fresh air of the Groves without actually living there. They'd come in groups of four or five, carrying boring-probes and formula charts, and they'd run assessments on sections of the Groves margin that they had no claim to and make notes in their field books.

Tallibat's dad was a Safety Grout inspector for Sector 3. This meant Tallibat knew the formula the way other kids knew their food preferences — without question, without origin, as something simply true. He was not mean about it. He was worse: he was certain. The certainty of a wombat who has been told, his entire life, that the formula works, and has never been in a situation where it didn't.

He was twelve when he started coming to the margin. I was nine. He brought a boring-probe that was better than anything we had in the Groves, which was both true and beside the point.

The first time was a finding game. Grid-kids played it with equipment — you hid a stone, you found it by dividing the area into a grid and probing at intervals, systematic, formula-correct. They wanted to play it in the Groves because the Groves clay was different from the grid-tunnel substrate and it was a good test of the method.

They hid the stone. They told us we could try.

Pellaboo probed twice, got clay both times, then borrowed the probe and hit a root, which she announced proudly.

I lay down and pressed my ear to the ground.

"What is he doing," Tallibat said. Not a question. More like something he needed documented.

"He does that," Pellaboo said.

I got up. Walked eleven paces north-northeast of where we'd started — not a grid coordinate, just where the ground felt different — and dug with my paws. Clay. Clay. Stone.

<!--

Style: small victory, class dynamic, the weird kid winning, character moment.
-->

Tallibat stared at the stone in my paw. Then at the field book. Then at the stone. His paw flexed on the boring-probe — the same reflex he'd had when he tried to listen, the calculating flex I'd learned to recognize.

"You got lucky," he said. He said it the way the Frequency said things: clear, certain, leaving no room for the response that might come if you stopped calculating long enough to hear it.

"Probably," I said.

He rehid the stone. Made sure I wasn't watching. Made his friends spread out so they could testify to the method. Then he said: go.

I lay down, pressed my ear to the ground, got up, walked eight paces east, dug.

Stone.

"That's not a replicable method," Tallibat said.

"I found it twice."

"Anecdotally."

I was nine years old and I did not know what anecdotally meant. But I knew it sounded like what the official report said about Morribat. I didn't say that. I went home and asked Cornelibat.

He went quiet in the way he went quiet when something hit him in a place he wasn't expecting. Then he said: "Tallibat's dad is a Grout inspector, you said?"

"Yes."

"Right," he said. And picked up his tea.

Then, after a moment: "There were others, you know. After Morribat. Not just her."

"Other listeners?"

"Mm." He looked at his tea. "Your uncle was one."

I waited. He did not continue. I had learned, by then, that pressing Cornelibat for information he'd decided to leave at the edge of a sentence was like pressing a sealed wall — you'd find nothing, and you'd feel the effort of it in your paws for a week.

"He's underground?" I asked, because *was* felt like the wrong word and he hadn't used it.

"He is," Cornelibat said.

That was all. He went back to his tea and the eucalyptus. I knew better than to press for more. Cornelibat's stories came when they came — the Water That Waited, the Counter Who Forgot His Own Name, the Grout That Knew Its Master. Some nights he told three before bed. Some nights none. The stories had their own timing, like the earth itself.

### The Bowl-Maker's Daughter

<!--

Style: craft workshop, generational knowledge, the Old Way visible in objects.
-->

Pellaboo's mother, Morillaboo, made singing bowls.

Not the Council-approved kind — those were cast from standardized alloy, tuned to 528 hertz, stamped with the Cathedral's resonance certification. The Cathedral called it the 'miracle tone,' the only frequency that mattered. Morillaboo's bowls were made from Groves clay, shaped by paw, fired in a surface kiln that predated the grid's Glow-Panel infrastructure.

"The alloy bowls," she'd told me once, when I was small enough to sit in her workshop and watch Pellaboo shape clay, "they ring clear. One note. No variation. The Cathedral calls this 'pure.' I call it 'dead.'"

She struck one of her bowls — a small one, dark blue, thin-walled. The sound was different from anything the alloy produced. It started with one tone, then opened into others, harmonics layering like sediment, like the earth itself was speaking through the vibration.

"A singing bowl should sing," she said. "Not announce. Not declare. Sing. The earth doesn't make pure tones, Hoebat. The earth makes chords."

I didn't understand the physics of it then. What I understood was that when Morillaboo struck her bowls, the Groves clay seemed to answer. The burrow walls hummed in sympathy. The sound had depth — temporal depth, though I wouldn't have called it that — like it was reaching back through the clay to something older than the tunnels, older than Melborow, older than the Council's categories.

Pellaboo learned to make bowls the way she learned everything: by mapping the process in her head until she could navigate it blind. She knew the clay's moisture content by the resistance against her paws. She knew when a wall was too thin by the change in how the material responded to pressure. She couldn't explain how she knew. She just knew.

"Your mother," Tallibat said to her once, during his second year of coming to the margin, "is making unlicensed resonance devices."

"Yes," Pellaboo said.

"That's illegal."

"Yes."

"The Cathedral's frequency standards exist for safety. Uncontrolled resonance can interfere with Grid stability."

Pellaboo looked at him — really looked at him, the way you look at a wall you're trying to decide whether it will hold. "Have you ever heard one?"

"I don't need to hear one. I understand the physics of—"

"Have you ever heard one," she repeated.

Tallibat was quiet.

"Come to the workshop," she said. "Tomorrow. I'll show you what the physics don't explain."

### The Listening

<!--

The bowl's vibration visible in the air, in the dust motes, in the way the Groves clay seems to answer. Pellaboo's face: knowing, patient, not triumphant. Just presenting evidence. The moment that changed Tallibat's understanding of resonance. Style: revelation, craft as knowledge, the moment of conversion, warm workshop light.
-->

He came. Of course he came. Tallibat's curiosity was always stronger than his certainty — he just had to be given permission to admit it.

Pellaboo gave him a medium bowl, dark blue, fired three weeks ago. "Hold it like this," she said. "Flat palm underneath. The bowl needs to feel the earth through you."

"That's not in any resonance manual."

"I know."

He held it. Awkwardly — the posture was strange to him, too exposed, too trusting of the material. But he held it.

Pellaboo struck the rim with a wrapped striker.

The sound was not what he expected. I'd watched him prepare for the 528-hertz pure tone he'd been trained to recognize as 'correct' — the Cathedral's 'miracle tone,' stripped of all other frequencies. What emerged was something else — a fundamental note, yes, but under it, around it, through it, other frequencies. The bowl sang in chords that touched all seven chakra tones: 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 — the full spectrum the Cathedral had discarded as 'impure.' And more than that: the sound continued, sustained, found harmonics in the workshop's clay walls that answered back.

Tallibat's paw flexed on the bowl's base — the calculating reflex I'd learned to recognize — but he didn't move. He stood there, holding, listening, while the sound decayed through its harmonic series over seventeen seconds.

"That's interference," he said finally. "Multiple frequencies creating beat patterns."

"Yes," Pellaboo agreed.

"The Cathedral standards eliminate interference."

"They eliminate complexity," she said. "They call it interference because they can only measure one thing at a time."

Tallibat looked at the bowl. At his paw, still holding it. At Pellaboo.

"Your mother's bowls," he said slowly. "They all do this?"

"They all do what the clay wants to do."

"And the clay... wants?"

Pellaboo smiled — the first time I'd seen her smile at Tallibat, not at his confusion but at the question itself. "That's what Hoebat listens for," she said. "That's what my mother shapes for. The clay has a voice. We just learn to hear it."

Tallibat stayed in the workshop for two hours that day. He struck every bowl Morillaboo had on her shelves. He asked about firing temperatures, clay composition, wall thickness ratios. He took notes — actual notes, in his field book, the same book where he'd recorded my "anecdotal" stone-findings years before.

When he left, he didn't say thank you. He said: "The Grid doesn't know about this."

"No," Pellaboo agreed.

"They should."

"They'd classify it," she said. "Uncontrolled resonance. Potential Static contamination. They'd seal the workshop and file a report."

Tallibat stood at the workshop door, looking back at the bowls on their shelves, at the clay on the walls, at Pellaboo with her paw still holding the striker.

"I want to learn," he said. "Not for the Grid. For me."

That was the beginning. Not friendship — that came later. The beginning was Tallibat discovering that the formula he'd been given was incomplete, and choosing to find out what it had left out.

### The Lesson of Lillaboo

<!--

Evening in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat with his tea, Hoebat at his feet with paws pressed to the clay. The eucalyptus moving outside. The conversation happening in the intimate space between story and instruction. Cornelibat not looking at his son, speaking to the trees, the tea, the distance. Hoebat listening with his whole body, the way he does. The moment when a father passes something necessary and dangerous to his child. Style: intimate, generational, the transfer of knowledge, evening light.
-->

I told Cornelibat about Tallibat's conversion. He listened in his way — sipping tea, watching the eucalyptus — and then he told me a story.

He had so many stories. Stories about listeners who failed and listeners who succeeded. Stories about the old guilds, the pre-Cathedral days, the wombats who dug by feel instead of formula. I had grown up swimming in them, never knowing which ones were history and which were parable, never needing to know. The story of Lillaboo was one of many he told about bowl-makers — there was also Pelliboo of the Western Tunnels, and Merritoo Who Fired Too Hot, and the Silent Bowl of Deep Sector Nine. They blurred together in my memory, each one adding a layer to my understanding of what it meant to make something that could truly sing.

"There was a bowl-maker," he said, "before your mother's time. Lillaboo. She made singing bowls for the Dust-Bearers — not the ceremony kind, the daily kind, the bowls they used to find each other in the deep tunnels."

I sat up straighter. I knew when a story was coming.

"Lillaboo was not a Dust-Bearer herself. She was a potter. She made bowls for grain, for water, for the ordinary things. But she had a feel for resonance — she could strike clay and know, by the return, whether the wall was too thick, whether the firing had been even, whether the bowl would hold its note."

"Like Morillaboo."

"Like Morillaboo," Cornelibat agreed. "The Dust-Bearers came to her because their old bowls were cracking. The deep tunnels were changing — pressure from above, the city's expansion, new Grid foundations pressing down. Their bowls no longer rang true. They needed new ones, tuned to the new earth."

"Did she make them?"

"She tried." Cornelibat watched a branch sway, pause, sway again. "She made bowls to the Dust-Bearers' specifications. Exact thickness, exact curve, exact clay composition. They took them into the tunnels. They struck them. And the bowls sang... wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"Too clear. Too pure. One note, no harmonics. The Dust-Bearers listened, and they could not find each other. The bowls rang, but they did not speak."

I frowned. "But she followed the specifications."

"She followed the specifications." Cornelibat picked up his tea again. "She measured everything. She calculated the resonance curves. She made bowls that should have worked. And they did not."

"What happened?"

"She went into the tunnels." Cornelibat sipped. "Not to find the Dust-Bearers — she didn't know where they were. Just to listen. To strike her bowls in different places and hear what came back. She spent three weeks underground, alone, eating cold bread, drinking from seepage pools."

"Did she find the answer?"

"She found that the answer was not in the bowls." Cornelibat turned the cup in his paws. "The specifications assumed the earth was static. Inert. A medium that carried sound but did not participate. But the deep clay — the pre-formation substrate, the kind we have here in the Groves — it breathes. It moves. It has a voice of its own."

I pressed my paws harder against the floor. "I can feel it. The breathing."

"I know." Cornelibat didn't look at me. "Lillaboo realized that a bowl for the Dust-Bearers could not be made to specifications. It had to be made to relationship. She had to shape each bowl while listening to the specific clay, the specific tunnel, the specific weight of earth above. She had to let the bowl tell her what it wanted to be."

"That's not in the Academy courses."

"No." Cornelibat smiled. "It is not. The Academy teaches you to impose your will on the earth. The Dust-Bearers learned to let the earth impose its will on them. Both are necessary, Hoebat. The Grid must hold. But someone must also listen."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Your uncle knew this. Hangbat. He understood that the Wail was not just bowls singing — it was relationship. The bowls finding each other through the earth. The earth answering back."

"The Wail?"

"What happens when many bowls sing together." Cornelibat's voice dropped into the register he used for important things. "When the resonance couples — when the vibrations find each other through the substrate — something happens. The earth listens back. Not in words. In presence. In the sense of being heard."

"Does it still happen?"

"I don't know." He said this simply. "Hangbat went looking for the Wail, fifteen years ago. He found... something. He stayed underground. He is still there, as far as I know."

"He's alive?"

"I believe so. The earth would tell me if he weren't." Cornelibat stood, stretched, looked at the sky darkening above the eucalyptus. "But I do not know where. He did not leave a map. The Wail does not need maps."

I stayed sitting, my paws still flat on the clay. I was thinking about bowls that sing, and uncles underground, and the difference between being right and being heard.

"Dad?"

"Mm?"

"When I'm older. When I go to the Academy. If I learn the formula, and I keep listening... will they let me be both?"

Cornelibat stood in the entrance of the burrow, his silhouette against the last light. He was quiet for a moment that stretched.

"I don't know," he said. "I hope so. For your sake, I hope so. But I will tell you this, Hoebat — and this is the only advice I have that might be worth following — when you find yourself in a room where you must choose between being accurate and being safe, choose accurate. The earth remembers. The Tally forgets. But you will have to live with yourself in the dark, when the Glow-Panels are off and the formulas don't matter, and in those moments, accuracy is the only company that stays."

He went inside. I stayed, my paws on the clay, listening to the earth breathe.

The clay hummed. The eucalyptus moved. The city glowed, distant, indifferent, believing itself the only light.

I listened.

### The Water Pocket

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The Dig-Off
Tallibat and his grid-kid crew digging a formula-straight tunnel through the Groves margin — boring-probe first, chalk-lines on the ground, systematic. On one side: Hoebat digging by feel, slower, the tunnel curving slightly where the earth asks it to. On the other: Tallibat going straight, fast, confident. The two tunnels visible in cross-section. One following the formula. One following the earth. Style: competition, two methods, underground cross-section, tension before the punchline.
-->

The water pocket happened in my tenth year. Tallibat had come to the margin with a bigger crew — six of them, carrying proper boring-equipment, ropes, a spirit level — to dig a passage shortcut from the grid tunnel entrance through the Groves clay and out to the surface access. He hadn't asked anyone's permission. Groves land didn't have a Tally-owner, which in Tallibat's logic meant it had no owner. My father watched from the burrow entrance and said nothing.

I was digging nearby, on my own, for no particular reason except that the earth in that section had been feeling interesting for a week — a quality I couldn't name, something different about the hum. I was following it the way you follow a smell, just to see where it went.

Tallibat glanced over. "You're going at an angle."

"I know."

"That's structurally inefficient."

"Probably."

He shook his head and went back to his formula-straight line. His crew were making good time — the boring-probe was good equipment, and Tallibat ran a tight dig. Chalk lines, measured intervals, everything by the method.

I hit the edge of the water pocket before I reached it.

The earth went different. The hum changed quality — from that deep tidal patient thing to something more immediate, more present, the specific pressure of water that's been sitting in a clay pocket since before anyone built anything above it.

I stopped. Angled east. Kept going.

Behind me, Tallibat's boring-probe punched through the pocket wall.

<!--

Agathaboo already heading over to assess the damage to the clay structure. Style: aftermath comedy, wet and embarrassed grid-kids, quiet Hoebat, community dealing with the mess.
-->

The water was not catastrophic. It was not a fast flood or a cascading failure. It was six juvenile wombats and a spirit level and three field books, soaking wet, backing out of a tunnel that had turned into a stream.

Tallibat's face, when he emerged, had the specific expression of someone who has just been wrong about something in front of witnesses and is calculating whether to acknowledge it or blame the ground.

He blamed the ground. "Undocumented water pocket. No way to detect without a full substrate survey."

"I went around it," I said.

"You got lucky."

"Twice," Pellaboo said, very quietly, from behind me.

Tallibat and his crew left. They came back the following week with a full substrate survey, documented three more pockets they'd missed, and left again without saying anything to me about it.

I spent two days fixing the breach with my mother, redirecting water into the surface-farm irrigation run. She did not comment on the cause. She made me pay attention to the fix — how the clay responded to pressure, where the water wanted to go, how you work with the direction of flow rather than against it.

"You have to let the earth show you what it's doing," she said once, packing a seal with her paw.

"Dad says the same thing."

"I know," she said. "It's why I married him. Also he makes good bread."

---

Three weeks after the water pocket, Tallibat came back to the margin alone.

No crew. No boring-probe. No field book. He stood at the edge of the Groves clay in his grid-kid clothes and looked like someone who had decided to do something and was now experiencing the gap between deciding and doing.

"Show me," he said.

Not *please*. Not *if you don't mind*. Tallibat didn't have that vocabulary yet. But he'd come back without his crew, which cost him something, and we both knew it.

I showed him. Not the method — you can't show someone the method, you can only show them the starting position. I showed him how to be still. How to put his paws flat and let the earth do the talking. He lasted about forty seconds before his instinct to measure something kicked in and he started calculating invert angles.

"Stop calculating," I said.

"I'm not—"

"You're calculating. Your paws go flat when you're listening and they flex when you're calculating. Stop."

He stopped. Tried again. Thirty seconds of actual stillness. He looked like it hurt.

Pellaboo was watching from a distance, perched on a tree root, her head tilted slightly north — she always knew north, I'd stopped asking how years ago. She was not watching Tallibat in the way people watch someone who is interesting. She was watching him the way you watch someone who has just done something surprising and you haven't decided yet what to do with that.

He didn't find anything that session. But he came back the following week. And the week after.

By the time I started at the Sector 7 Academy, Tallibat had stopped coming to the margin to prove something and started coming because the clay felt different from anything he'd learned in his father's formula books, and different was interesting, and interesting was something Tallibat, underneath all the certainty, had always been.
