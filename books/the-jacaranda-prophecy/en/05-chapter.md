### Morribat

My father told his stories the same way he told everything important — matter-of-fact, quiet, like reciting weather. No performance. No moral attached at the end. Just: here is a thing that happened. Then he'd pick up his tea and look out at the eucalyptus moving in the night air and let the story sit there until you figured out what to do with it.

Night in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat sits with his tea, looking out at the eucalyptus. Young Hoebat (eight years old) sits on the clay floor with his paws pressed flat against it, listening. The burrow is warm — real wood-light, clay walls packed by paw, no Safety Grout. Outside, the surface air moves through the stringybark. The underground city is a distant glow. The atmosphere is intimate, unhurried, the specific warmth of a story being told for the dozenth time and still meaning something. Style: domestic, warm, father-son, organic textures, night.

The story he told most often was about Morribat.

Morribat worked the eastern deep grid three generations back, before my grandfather's time. She was a Root-Counter like Cornelibat, but what she actually was, was a listener. The guild paid her per prediction: tell us where the water is going to come, before it comes. She was always right. They didn't ask how she knew. The how was her business. What mattered was the Tally — she predicted, they reinforced, the tunnels held. Clean accounting.

After she died they tried to replicate the method. Brought in four senior Root-Counters, three certified engineers, and a High Auditor from the Cathedral with a fresh Tally-stone to oversee the documentation. They interviewed everyone she'd ever worked with. Nobody could explain the method because Morribat had never explained it. She sat in the tunnel. She listened. She told them where the water was going to be.

The official report, filed sixty years after her death, described her predictions as "statistically significant anecdotal evidence." The tunnels she identified are still in the eastern grid. Maintained. Not failed. All the tunnels the four senior Root-Counters approved during the same period have been replaced at least twice.

Cornelibat never said: here is what this means, here is the lesson, here is what you should take from this story. He just told it and went quiet.

I was eight the first time I heard it. I pressed my paws to the burrow floor the next morning and tried to listen for water.

I didn't find any.

But I felt something — a quality I didn't have a word for yet. Deep. Tidal. Patient. Not quite sound. Not quite pressure. Something the earth had been doing since long before anyone bored a tunnel through it and would keep doing long after.

I kept trying.

### The Margin

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Eucalyptus Groves
The Groves margin — the transitional zone between Melborow's grid tunnels and the surface. Stringybark trees with roots pressing into dark blue clay. A cluster of unregistered burrows, dug by paw, no Grout. Washing on a line between two trees. Juvenile wombats playing in the clay — one of them (Hoebat) lying with his ear against the ground while the others roll and dig and chase each other. The city visible in one direction, sky in the other. Unofficial, unnotched, alive. Style: community, organic architecture, margin life, warmth and scrappiness.
-->

The Eucalyptus Groves ran along the eastern margin of Melborow, in the zone the city had not yet decided what to do with. The official maps called it Transitional Zone 4. The wombats who lived there called it the Groves. The grid-kids who came out on weekends called it Unnotched Territory, which was accurate — none of the burrows here had Tally-registrations, which meant the Council didn't count them.

Cornelibat's burrow was three tunnels in from the stringybark line. Dark blue clay — the good kind, pre-formation, the kind that packs and holds without chemistry. Our walls had paw-prints in them. You could read the pressure-marks like a record of who built what and when. No Safety Grout. No grid-tunnel access.

Agathaboo had put a geologist's survey note on the wall — from the drainage assessment she'd run for the surface farms, which operated without Council permits because the rains came every year regardless of the application status. The geologist had written: *exceptionally stable load-bearing material, pre-formation period, undervalued by current assessment models.* She'd underlined *undervalued by current assessment models* in red.

The Council's assessment model put our address as: Unregistered. No Tally-value.

The wall and the Council did not agree on what our home was worth.

I grew up in it alongside Pellaboo, two burrows down — her dad ran the surface-access ladder, her mum made the best clay-pressed bread in the margin, and she herself could hold her breath longer than anyone in the Groves and counted her footsteps everywhere she went. We played in the clay. We dug the way kids dig — without method, for the pleasure of it, following whatever the earth seemed to want.

I was the one who lay down and pressed my ear to the ground.

Pellaboo learned early that this was just something Hoebat did, the same way she had a thing about counting footsteps. We each had our thing. Mine just looked stranger because mine involved lying face-down in the dirt.

### Tallibat

-->

The grid-kids came to the margin on late-season weekends when the grid tunnels got warm and the families with Tally-notches wanted the fresh air of the Groves without actually living there. They'd come in groups of four or five, carrying boring-probes and formula charts, and they'd run assessments on sections of the Groves margin that they had no claim to and make notes in their field books.

Tallibat's dad was a Safety Grout inspector for Sector 3. This meant Tallibat knew the formula the way other kids knew their food preferences — without question, without origin, as something simply true. He was not mean about it. He was worse: he was certain. The certainty of a wombat who has been told, his entire life, that the formula works, and has never been in a situation where it didn't.

He was twelve when he started coming to the margin. I was nine. He brought a boring-probe that was better than anything we had in the Groves, which was both true and beside the point.

The first time was a finding game. Grid-kids played it with equipment — you hid a stone, you found it by dividing the area into a grid and probing at intervals, systematic, formula-correct. They wanted to play it in the Groves because the Groves clay was different from the grid-tunnel substrate and it was a good test of the method.

They hid the stone. They told us we could try.

Pellaboo probed twice, got clay both times, then borrowed the probe and hit a root, which she announced proudly.

I lay down and pressed my ear to the ground.

"What is he doing," Tallibat said. Not a question. More like something he needed documented.

"He does that," Pellaboo said.

I got up. Walked eleven paces north-northeast of where we'd started — not a grid coordinate, just where the ground felt different — and dug with my paws. Clay. Clay. Stone.

-->

Tallibat stared at the stone in my paw. Then at the field book. Then at the stone.

"You got lucky," he said.

"Probably," I said.

He rehid the stone. Made sure I wasn't watching. Made his friends spread out so they could testify to the method. Then he said: go.

I lay down, pressed my ear to the ground, got up, walked eight paces east, dug.

Stone.

"That's not a replicable method," Tallibat said.

"I found it twice."

"Anecdotally."

I was nine years old and I did not know what anecdotally meant. But I knew it sounded like what the official report said about Morribat. I didn't say that. I went home and asked Cornelibat.

He went quiet in the way he went quiet when something hit him in a place he wasn't expecting. Then he said: "Tallibat's dad is a Grout inspector, you said?"

"Yes."

"Right," he said. And picked up his tea.

Then, after a moment: "There were others, you know. After Morribat. Not just her."

"Other listeners?"

"Mm." He looked at his tea. "Your uncle was one."

I waited. He did not continue. I had learned, by then, that pressing Cornelibat for information he'd decided to leave at the edge of a sentence was like pressing a sealed wall — you'd find nothing, and you'd feel the effort of it in your paws for a week.

"He's underground?" I asked, because *was* felt like the wrong word and he hadn't used it.

"He is," Cornelibat said.

That was all. He went back to his tea and the eucalyptus, and the name Hangbat sat in the room like a stone he'd set down carefully and didn't want moved.

### The Water Pocket

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: The Dig-Off
Tallibat and his grid-kid crew digging a formula-straight tunnel through the Groves margin — boring-probe first, chalk-lines on the ground, systematic. On one side: Hoebat digging by feel, slower, the tunnel curving slightly where the earth asks it to. On the other: Tallibat going straight, fast, confident. The two tunnels visible in cross-section. One following the formula. One following the earth. Style: competition, two methods, underground cross-section, tension before the punchline.
-->

The water pocket happened in my tenth year. Tallibat had come to the margin with a bigger crew — six of them, carrying proper boring-equipment, ropes, a spirit level — to dig a passage shortcut from the grid tunnel entrance through the Groves clay and out to the surface access. He hadn't asked anyone's permission. Groves land didn't have a Tally-owner, which in Tallibat's logic meant it had no owner. My father watched from the burrow entrance and said nothing.

I was digging nearby, on my own, for no particular reason except that the earth in that section had been feeling interesting for a week — a quality I couldn't name, something different about the hum. I was following it the way you follow a smell, just to see where it went.

Tallibat glanced over. "You're going at an angle."

"I know."

"That's structurally inefficient."

"Probably."

He shook his head and went back to his formula-straight line. His crew were making good time — the boring-probe was good equipment, and Tallibat ran a tight dig. Chalk lines, measured intervals, everything by the method.

I hit the edge of the water pocket before I reached it.

The earth went different. The hum changed quality — from that deep tidal patient thing to something more immediate, more present, the specific pressure of water that's been sitting in a clay pocket since before anyone built anything above it. I stopped. Angled east. Kept going.

Behind me, Tallibat's boring-probe punched through the pocket wall.

<!--

The aftermath: Tallibat's crew soaking wet, clay-covered, backing out of the flooded tunnel. Water running through the Groves clay in all directions. Tallibat's spirit level floating away. His field book, ruined. Hoebat watching from the side, dry, at the entrance to his own tunnel that went around the pocket. The Groves kids trying not to visibly enjoy it. Agathaboo already heading over to assess the damage to the clay structure. Style: aftermath comedy, wet and embarrassed grid-kids, quiet Hoebat, community dealing with the mess.
-->

The water was not catastrophic. It was not a fast flood or a cascading failure. It was six juvenile wombats and a spirit level and three field books, soaking wet, backing out of a tunnel that had turned into a stream.

Tallibat's face, when he emerged, had the specific expression of someone who has just been wrong about something in front of witnesses and is calculating whether to acknowledge it or blame the ground.

He blamed the ground. "Undocumented water pocket. No way to detect without a full substrate survey."

"I went around it," I said.

"You got lucky."

"Twice," Pellaboo said, very quietly, from behind me.

Tallibat and his crew left. They came back the following week with a full substrate survey, documented three more pockets they'd missed, and left again without saying anything to me about it.

I spent two days fixing the breach with my mother, redirecting the water into the surface-farm irrigation run. She did not comment on the cause. She made me pay attention to the fix — how the clay responded to pressure, where the water wanted to go, how you work with the direction of flow rather than against it.

"You have to let the earth show you what it's doing," she said once, packing a seal with her paw.

"Dad says the same thing."

"I know," she said. "It's why I married him. Also he makes good bread."

---

Three weeks after the water pocket, Tallibat came back to the margin alone.

No crew. No boring-probe. No field book. He stood at the edge of the Groves clay in his grid-kid clothes and looked like someone who had decided to do something and was now experiencing the gap between deciding and doing.

"Show me," he said.

Not *please*. Not *if you don't mind*. Tallibat didn't have that vocabulary yet. But he'd come back without his crew, which cost him something, and we both knew it.

I showed him. Not the method — you can't show someone the method, you can only show them the starting position. I showed him how to be still. How to put his paws flat and let the earth do the talking. He lasted about forty seconds before his instinct to measure something kicked in and he started calculating invert angles.

"Stop calculating," I said.

"I'm not—"

"You're calculating. Your paws go flat when you're listening and they flex when you're calculating. Stop."

He stopped. Tried again. Thirty seconds of actual stillness. He looked like it hurt.

Pellaboo was watching from a distance, perched on a tree root with her footstep-count going — she always kept a silent count of steps, I'd stopped asking why years ago. She was not watching Tallibat in the way people watch someone who is interesting. She was watching him the way you watch someone who has just done something surprising and you haven't decided yet what to do with that.

He didn't find anything that session. But he came back the following week. And the week after.

By the time I started at the Sector 7 Academy, Tallibat had stopped coming to the margin to prove something and started coming because the clay felt different from anything he'd learned in his father's formula books, and different was interesting, and interesting was something Tallibat, underneath all the certainty, had always been.
