### Before the Stories, the People

Before the stories, you should know who told them. Because the stories were never separate from the people who told them and the people they were told to, and if I start with Morribat you'll miss the whole thing.

My father was Cornelibat. Seam-Reader, ex-certified, still right about the earth after the certification ended. He'd been removed from the guild the way grain-running cracks get sealed — because he looked bad, and the official record didn't have a category for *looks bad but is actually working.* After, he brought us to the Eucalyptus Groves, dug our burrow by paw in pre-formation clay, and made tea every evening. He never called the lost certification a tragedy. This was its own kind of story — the kind you don't tell so the ones you're telling can breathe.

My mother was Agathaboo. She ran surface-farm drainage assessments without a Council permit, because the rains came regardless of application status and the farms needed the assessments whether or not the forms were filed. She had a geologist's note on the burrow wall with *undervalued* underlined in red. She made good bread. She had married a wombat who told stories and she understood this as a full-time occupation with unpredictable hours.

Our burrow was three tunnels in from the stringybark line. No Safety Grout. No Tally-registration. The Council's assessment: *no value.* The wall disagreed in silence for as long as I can remember.

These are my people.

Now the stories.

### The Bowl That Sings

My father told stories the way most wombats breathe — without deciding to.

Made tea: a story started. Fixed the entrance wall: a different story, variation on a theme he'd run before, checking if it still held. Watched the eucalyptus move against the city's far-off glow: a third story, older, from a place inside him he didn't visit until the air was right. He's have a story for everything. You'd turn around and the story was already there, weather arriving, settled before you noticed the clouds.

We sat at the burrow entrance watching the city pulse distant and yellow in the dark, and he looked at the eucalyptus instead of me. He almost always looked somewhere else when it mattered.

"Morribat was a Seam-Reader," he said. "Eastern deep grid, three generations back, before your grandfather's first claw-guard. Simple arrangement: she'd go into a tunnel, sit a while, come out, tell them where the water was headed. The guild paid per prediction."

I pressed my paws flat against the clay floor. I'd been doing this for two months. Couldn't explain it — just that the floor had something to say, and I was trying to learn the language.

"She was right. Every time, right. They didn't ask how. The *how* is fragile. Put a committee on the *how* and you lose the *what.* What mattered was the count: she predicted, they reinforced, the tunnels held. Clean numbers. Everyone's ledger looked correct."

He turned the cup in his paws.

"After she died — and she did, though she chose her moment better than most — four senior Seam-Readers, three certified engineers, and a High Auditor from the Cathedral with a fresh Tally-stone assembled to document her method. Interviewed everyone who'd ever worked beside her. Wrote everything down. Filed a report sixty years after her death." A pause. "Sixty years, Hoebat. Not one of her tunnels had failed."

The eucalyptus moved. The tea cooled.

"Their phrase for her." He said it the way you'd quote someone calling a river *localized moisture displacement.* "*Statistically significant anecdotal evidence.*"

I watched his profile against the trees. Not angry — past anger, in the place you reach when a thing has been wrong so long that feeling strongly about it seems like a waste of good energy. The wrong was just true now. A feature of the landscape.

"Every tunnel she identified: standing. The tunnels the four certified Seam-Readers approved in the same period — the proper ones, the documented ones, the ones with methods you could explain to a committee — replaced at least twice each. Some of them three times."

He picked up his tea. "Drink yours. It's cold."

I lay with my paws against the burrow floor the next morning and tried to find water.

Didn't find any.

But I found something else — a quality I had no word for yet. Depth. Patient. Older than the tunnels, older than Melborow, older than whoever first decided to build a city underground and call the decision civilization. Not sound exactly. Not pressure exactly. Something that had been waiting before waiting had a name.

I kept trying.

Cornelibat watched without comment. He had stories for this — the Apprentice Who Pressed Too Hard, the Clay That Sang Before the Ground Gave — but he didn't tell them. He let me lie there. Let the earth do the teaching he'd already arranged.

### The Margin

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Eucalyptus Groves
The Groves margin — the transitional zone between Melborow's grid tunnels and the surface. Stringybark trees with roots pressing into dark blue clay. A cluster of unregistered burrows, dug by paw, no Grout. Washing on a line between two trees. Juvenile wombats playing in the clay — one of them (Hoebat) lying with his ear against the ground while the others roll and dig and chase each other. The city visible in one direction, sky in the other. Unofficial, unnotched, alive. Style: community, organic architecture, margin life, warmth and scrappiness.
-->

The Eucalyptus Groves ran along Melborow's eastern edge, in the zone the city hadn't decided what to do with yet. Official maps: *Transitional Zone 4.* The wombats who lived there: the Groves. The grid-kids who came on late weekends wanting fresh air without the address: *Unnotched Territory,* which was accurate — no Tally-registrations on any of the burrows, which meant the Council didn't count them. Things the Council doesn't count don't exist. The wall of our burrow existed anyway.

Cornelibat's burrow: three tunnels in from the stringybark line. Dark blue clay — pre-formation stock, the kind that packs and holds without chemistry. Paw-prints in the walls. The whole history of the place pressed there, readable if you knew the pressure-language. No Safety Grout. No grid access.

Agathaboo had put a geologist's note on the wall beside the entrance — from the surface-farm drainage assessment she'd run without a Council permit, because the rains came every year regardless of application status. The geologist had written: *exceptionally stable load-bearing material, pre-formation period, undervalued by current assessment models.* She'd underlined *undervalued* in red and left it where visitors could read it.

The Council's assessment: *Unregistered. No value.*

The wall and the Council disagreed about what the word *value* meant. The wall didn't lose the argument. Walls don't argue — they just stand or they don't.

I grew up there alongside Pellaboo, two burrows down. Her dad ran the surface-access ladder. Her mum made the best clay-pressed bread in the margin and the only singing bowls in the Groves that made the walls hum back. Pellaboo herself could hold her breath longer than anyone she'd ever met, and she carried a map of the clay formations in her head that no one had drawn for her. We played in the dirt. We dug the way kids dig — following the earth because the earth seemed to have opinions, and opinions are interesting.

I was the one who lay face-down and pressed his ear to the ground.

Pellaboo catalogued this in the first week alongside everything else she knew: Hoebat does the ground thing, north is north, wet clay smells different from dry. Her mental survey. Mine just looked stranger to outsiders because mine involved lying down in public.

### Tallibat

Style: class dynamics, juvenile confrontation, margin vs. grid, afternoon light.
-->

The grid-kids came to the margin on late-season weekends when the official tunnels got warm and their families wanted the Groves air without the Groves address. They came in groups, carrying boring-probes and formula charts, and they'd run assessments on sections of the margin they had no claim to and write things in field books with their names on the covers.

Tallibat's father was a Safety Grout inspector for Sector 3. This meant Tallibat knew the formula the way other wombats know their own reflection — not from study, just from growing up with it everywhere, in every room, every conversation. He was not cruel about it. That would have been easier. He was *certain.* The specific certainty of someone who has never been in a room where the formula failed and doesn't know such rooms exist.

He was twelve when he started coming to the margin. I was nine. He brought a boring-probe that was better than anything we had in the Groves, which was true and not the point.

First visit: a finding game. Grid-kids played it with equipment — hide a stone, divide the area into systematic intervals, probe until found. They wanted to test the method in Groves clay because Groves clay was different from grid-tunnel material and a different test is better data.

They hid the stone. Told us we could try.

Pellaboo probed twice, got clay, borrowed the probe, hit a root, announced the root proudly.

I lay down and pressed my ear to the ground.

"What is he doing," Tallibat said. Not a question — a notation for the record.

"He does that," Pellaboo said.

I got up. Walked eleven paces north-northeast — not a grid coordinate, just where the earth felt like it had been recently disturbed — and dug with my paws. Clay. More clay. Stone.

<!--

Style: small victory, class dynamic, the weird kid winning, character moment.
-->

Tallibat stared at the stone in my paw. Then the field book. Then the stone. His paw flexed on the boring-probe — the reflex I'd come to recognize. The calculating reflex.

"Lucky," he said. The same register as the official reports calling Morribat's tunnels anecdotal. Exactly the same register.

"Probably," I said.

He rehid the stone. Spread his friends out as witnesses. Made sure I wasn't watching. Said: go.

I lay down. Pressed my ear to the ground. Got up. Eight paces east. Dug.

Stone.

"That's not a replicable method," Tallibat said.

"I found it twice."

"Anecdotally."

I was nine and didn't know what anecdotally meant. But I knew the sound of it — the word the official report had used for Morribat. I didn't say that. I went home and asked Cornelibat.

He went quiet — that particular quiet, the one that meant something had arrived somewhere he hadn't expected it.

"Tallibat's father is a Grout inspector," he said.

"Yes."

"Right." He picked up his tea.

Then, after a moment: "There were others, you know. After Morribat. Listeners. Not many."

"Other listeners?"

"Mm." He looked at his tea. Not at me. "Your uncle was one."

I waited. He had set something down at the edge of a sentence and stopped. I'd learned by then: pressing Cornelibat for information he'd decided to leave there was like pressing a sealed wall. You'd find nothing and your paws would ache for a week.

"He's underground?" I asked. Because *was* felt wrong and he hadn't used it.

"He is," Cornelibat said.

That was all. Back to the tea. Back to the eucalyptus. The stories knew their own timing. The earth did too.

### The Water Pocket

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The Dig-Off
Tallibat and his grid-kid crew digging a formula-straight tunnel through the Groves margin — boring-probe first, chalk-lines on the ground, systematic. On one side: Hoebat digging by feel, slower, the tunnel curving slightly where the earth asks it to. On the other: Tallibat going straight, fast, confident. The two tunnels visible in cross-section. One following the formula. One following the earth. Style: competition, two methods, underground cross-section, tension before the punchline.
-->

The water pocket happened in my tenth year. Tallibat came with a bigger crew — six of them, real boring-equipment, ropes, a spirit level — to cut a passage through the Groves clay from the grid entrance to the surface-access point. He'd gotten permission from no one, since Groves land had no registered owner and in Tallibat's logic, what the Council doesn't own doesn't require permission. My father watched from the burrow entrance and said nothing.

I was digging nearby, on my own, for no particular reason except that the earth in that section had been interesting for a week — something different in the hum of it, a quality I'd been meaning to investigate. The way you follow a smell, just to see where it leads.

Tallibat glanced over. "You're going at an angle."

"Yes."

"Structurally inefficient."

"Probably."

His crew were making good time. The boring-probe was good equipment and Tallibat ran a tight operation. Chalk lines, measured intervals, everything documented.

I hit the edge of the water pocket before I reached it.

The clay changed. Something different in what I was feeling — not the deep patient thing, but something more immediate. The specific weight of water that's been sitting sealed in a clay pocket since before anyone built anything above it. Old water. Waiting water. I knew the quality by then the way I knew the eucalyptus smell — not by thinking about it, just by knowing.

I stopped. Angled east. Kept going.

Behind me, Tallibat's boring-probe punched through the pocket wall.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 9: The Water
The aftermath: Tallibat's crew soaking wet, clay-covered, backing out of the flooded tunnel. Water running through the Groves clay in all directions. Tallibat's spirit level floating away. His field book, ruined. Hoebat watching from the side, dry, at the entrance to his own tunnel that went around the pocket. The Groves kids trying not to visibly enjoy it. Agathaboo already heading over to assess the damage to the clay structure. Style: aftermath comedy, wet and embarrassed grid-kids, quiet Hoebat, community dealing with the mess.
-->

The water was not catastrophic. It was not a flood. It was six juvenile wombats and a spirit level and three field books, soaking wet, backing out of a tunnel that had become a stream.

Tallibat's face, when he emerged, had the specific expression of a wombat processing a public error while calculating how to characterize it.

He chose: "Undocumented water pocket. No way to detect without a full substrate survey."

"I went around it," I said.

"You got lucky."

"Twice," Pellaboo said, very quietly, from somewhere behind me.

Tallibat and his crew left. They came back the following week with a proper survey, documented three more pockets they'd missed, and left again without speaking to me about any of it.

I spent two days fixing the breach with my mother. She redirected the flow into the surface-farm irrigation channel. She didn't comment on who'd caused the breach. She made me pay attention to the fix — how the clay behaved under pressure, where the water wanted to go, how you work with the direction of flow instead of against it.

"You have to let the earth show you what it's doing," she said, packing a seal with her paw.

"Dad says the same thing."

"I know," she said. "It's why I married him. Also he makes good bread."

---

Three weeks later, Tallibat came back to the margin alone.

No crew. No boring-probe. No field book. He stood at the edge of the Groves clay in his grid-kid clothes, looking like someone who has made a decision and is now experiencing the gap between the decision and the doing.

"Show me," he said.

Not *please.* Tallibat didn't have that vocabulary yet. But he'd come without his crew — that cost him something, and we both knew it.

I showed him the starting position. Not the method — there's no method, only the position: paws flat, weight even, stop calculating, let the earth do the talking. He lasted forty seconds before his paw flexed and the calculating started back up.

"Stop calculating," I said.

"I'm not—"

"Your paws go flat when you're listening. They flex when you're calculating. Stop."

He stopped. Tried again. Thirty seconds of real stillness. He looked like it physically hurt.

He didn't find anything that session. He came back the following week. And the week after.

He never announced what he was looking for. Just came, pressed his paws flat, and waited until the calculating reflex pulled him back out. Then he came back and tried again.

Pellaboo watched this for two weeks before she said anything.

### The Bowl-Maker's Daughter

<!--

Some plain, some etched with the old patterns, all made from Groves clay. A small potter's wheel, hand-cranked. Young Pellaboo shaping clay beside her mother. The bowls have that particular curve that catches sound — wider at the rim, thinner at the wall. The dust of the Groves in the air, the smell of wet clay. Style: craft workshop, generational knowledge, the Old Way visible in objects.
-->

Pellaboo's mother Morillaboo made singing bowls.

Not the Cathedral-approved kind — those were cast from standardized alloy, stamped with the certification, made to ring at one specific pitch the Cathedral had decided was the only pitch that mattered. *The pure tone.* The alloy bowls rang the same note everywhere, always, regardless of what the walls around them were doing. Consistent. Predictable. Dead.

Morillaboo's bowls were made from Groves clay. Shaped by paw. Fired in a surface kiln that predated the grid's light infrastructure by three generations. They didn't ring the same note everywhere. They *sang.* Different depending on the room, the day, the particular quality of air and clay and whoever was holding them.

"The alloy bowls," she'd told me once, when I was small enough to sit in her workshop without needing a reason for being there, "ring clean. One note. Never different. The Cathedral calls this *pure.*"

She struck one of her bowls — small, dark blue, thin-walled. What came out wasn't one note. It was a conversation. The first tone arrived and then the others came in behind it, underneath it, through it, each one staying while the next one entered. The workshop's clay walls hummed back. The bowls on the shelves seemed to lean toward the sound.

"A singing bowl should sing," she said. "Not declare. Not announce. The earth doesn't make one note, Hoebat. The earth makes chords."

I didn't understand the mechanics of it then. What I understood: when Morillaboo struck her bowls, the Groves clay answered. Like the earth had been listening and the bowl had just said exactly the right thing.

Pellaboo learned to make bowls the way she learned everything: building the map in her head until she could navigate blind. She knew the moisture in the clay by the resistance against her paws. She knew when a wall was too thin by the way the material stopped pushing back. Ask her how she knew. She'd give you the same look Morillaboo gave the alloy bowls — not contempt, just the mild impatience of someone for whom the question doesn't quite make sense.

"Your mother," Tallibat said to her once, during his second year of coming to the margin, "is making unlicensed bell devices."

"Yes," Pellaboo said.

"That's illegal."

"Yes."

"The Cathedral's pitch standards exist for safety. Uncontrolled bell output can interfere with Grid stability."

Pellaboo looked at him. The look she used on walls she was deciding about. "Have you ever heard one?"

"I understand the principles—"

"Have you ever heard one."

Tallibat went quiet.

"Come tomorrow," she said. "I'll show you what the principles don't explain."

### The Listening

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 11: The First Bowl Strike
Tallibat in Morillaboo's workshop, watching Pellaboo strike a finished singing bowl. His expression — the specific face of someone whose certainty has just encountered something it cannot categorize. The bowl's vibration visible in the air, in the dust motes, in the way the Groves clay seems to answer. Pellaboo's face: knowing, patient, not triumphant. Just presenting evidence. The moment that changed Tallibat's understanding. Style: revelation, craft as knowledge, the moment of conversion, warm workshop light.
-->

He came. Of course he came. Tallibat's curiosity was always stronger than his certainty — he just needed permission to admit it. Pellaboo had given him a door and he walked through it, because he was, underneath everything, a wombat who genuinely wanted to know what was true.

She handed him a medium bowl, dark blue, three weeks from the kiln. "Hold it like this. Flat palm underneath. Let the earth feel you before the bowl does."

"That's not in any manual."

"I know."

He held it. Awkwardly — too many years of handling things by their function rather than their nature. But he held it.

Pellaboo struck the rim.

What came out was not what the Cathedral's single approved tone sounds like. It was the opposite of that — not simplicity but fullness. A low note that opened into others, each arrived and stayed while the next came in. The workshop's clay walls answered. The bowls on their shelves leaned slightly forward. The sound decayed through seventeen seconds of harmonic conversation, each layer finding the next, none of them the Cathedral's clean single pitch.

Tallibat's paw flexed on the bowl's base — the calculation reflex. But he didn't move. He stood there through all seventeen seconds.

"That's layering," he said finally. "Multiple tones overlapping."

"Yes," Pellaboo agreed.

"Cathedral standards eliminate that."

"They eliminate complexity," she said. "They call the extra voices interference because they can only measure one thing at a time. Put a ruler on it and call the parts that don't fit the ruler the problem."

Tallibat looked at the bowl. At his paw, still holding it. At Pellaboo.

"They all do this? Her bowls?"

"They all do what the clay wants to do."

"And the clay—" He stopped. Tried again. "The clay *wants.*"

First time I'd seen Pellaboo smile at Tallibat. Not at his confusion. At the question itself — the actual question he'd finally asked.

"That's what Hoebat listens for," she said. "What my mother shapes for. The clay has a voice. We just learn to hear it."

Tallibat stayed in the workshop two hours. Struck every bowl on every shelf. Asked about clay composition, firing temperatures, wall thickness ratios. Took notes in his field book — same field book where he'd documented my *anecdotal* stone-findings years before, same handwriting, different understanding of what the notes were for.

When he left, he said: "The Grid doesn't know about this."

"No," Pellaboo agreed.

"They should."

"They'd classify it," she said. "Uncontrolled bell output. They'd seal the workshop and file a report saying they'd fixed a problem that didn't exist."

He stood in the doorway, looking back at the shelves, the clay walls, Pellaboo with the striker still in her paw.

"I want to learn," he said. "Not for the Grid. For me."

That was the beginning. Not friendship — that came later. The beginning was Tallibat discovering that the formula he'd been handed was incomplete, and choosing to find out what it had left out. That choice takes something. Most wombats choose not to see the gap rather than look into it.

Tallibat looked. He'd been looking, in his way, since the water.

### The Lesson of Lillaboo

<!--

Evening in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat with his tea, Hoebat at his feet with paws pressed to the clay. The eucalyptus moving outside. The conversation happening in the intimate space between story and instruction. Cornelibat not looking at his son, speaking to the trees, the tea, the distance. Hoebat listening with his whole body. The moment when a father passes something necessary and dangerous to his child. Style: intimate, generational, the transfer of knowledge, evening light.
-->

I told Cornelibat about Tallibat's conversion. He listened in his way — sipping tea, watching the eucalyptus — and then he told me a story.

He had so many stories. They formed the atmosphere of my childhood the way the smell of clay forms the atmosphere of the Groves: you stopped noticing it directly and just breathed it. This one was about a bowl-maker — there were others, Pelliboo of the Western Tunnels, Merritoo Who Fired Too Hot, the Bowl of Deep Sector Nine that nobody could hear and everybody could feel — but Lillaboo specifically was the one he reached for now, and Cornelibat only reached for the specific ones when the specific ones were necessary.

"There was a bowl-maker," he said. "Before your mother's time, before mine. Lillaboo. She made bowls for the Dust-Bearers — not ceremony bowls, working bowls, the kind they struck in the deep tunnels to find each other when the dark was too complete for any other method."

I sat up slightly. Something in the word *working* had caught.

"She was not a Dust-Bearer herself. A potter. Clay, water jars, the ordinary round of it. But her ear was different. She could strike a bowl before it went into the kiln and know — from how the sound moved back through the clay — whether the wall would hold its pitch. Whether the bowl would carry its voice or just ring and die."

"Like Morillaboo."

"Like Morillaboo." He watched a branch sway, stop, sway again. "The Dust-Bearers came to her because their old bowls were going quiet. The deep grid was changing — city expansion above, new foundations pressing down, the ground shifting under years of that weight. The bowls they'd always used to find each other through the clay: no longer working. They needed new ones, made for the new ground."

"Did she make them?"

"She made them exactly to their specifications." He set down his tea. "Measured everything. Calculated every curve. Used the same clay-vein, the same kiln temperature, the same striker weight. Made bowls that by any measurement should have worked." A pause. "The Dust-Bearers took them underground. They struck them."

"And?"

"The bowls rang. Clean. Clear. One note, nothing else. Perfect by every standard the guild could apply." He looked at me for the first time in the story. "And the Dust-Bearers could not find each other."

I frowned. "But she followed the specifications."

"She followed the specifications." He picked up his tea again. "She went underground to understand why. Not to find the Dust-Bearers — she didn't know where they were. Just to sit in the deep sections with her bowls and listen to what came back. Three weeks underground, Hoebat. Cold bread. Seepage water from the walls. Alone in the dark striking clay and hearing what the dark returned."

I pressed my paws harder against the floor.

"She found that her specifications assumed the earth was inert. Dead material. A medium that carries sound without participating in it. But the deep clay — the old clay, the pre-formation kind, the kind we have here in the Groves that was here before anyone dug a tunnel through it — it breathes. It moves. It has a voice of its own. Not separate from the bowl's voice. In conversation with it, from the moment the bowl enters the space."

"I can feel that," I said. "The breathing."

"I know you can." He still didn't look at me. "Lillaboo's bowls were speaking to a version of the earth that no longer existed. The specifications were exact for a ground that had moved on. She had to start again — new method. Shape each bowl in the specific tunnel, listening to the specific clay above and below and all around, letting the bowl tell her what it needed to be rather than telling the bowl what she needed it to be."

"That's not in the Academy courses."

"No." Something in his voice that was almost a laugh. "The Academy teaches you to impose your will on the earth. The Dust-Bearers learned to receive the earth's will and work with it. Both are necessary — the tunnels must hold, the city must stand. But someone must also listen. Or eventually there's nothing left to hold."

He was quiet a moment. I waited.

"Your uncle understood this," he said, and his voice dropped into the register he used for things that had cost something. "Hangbat. He understood that the Wail was not ceremony — it was relationship. Bowl and clay in conversation. Wombat and earth in conversation. Something happening in that conversation that neither side could produce alone."

"The Wail?"

"When many bowls sing together in the right space. When the sound finds itself through the clay and the clay answers back. Not words. Not signal. Presence. The specific feeling of being heard by something larger than yourself."

"Does it still happen?"

"I don't know," Cornelibat said simply. "Hangbat went looking for it fifteen years ago. He found something. He stayed underground. He is still there, as far as I know."

"He's alive?"

"I believe so. The earth would tell me otherwise." He stood, stretched, looked at the last light fading in the eucalyptus. "But I don't know where. He didn't leave a map. The Wail doesn't need maps. It needs ears, patience, and bowls that know what they are."

I stayed on the clay with my paws flat and thought about bowls, and uncles, and the distance between being right and being heard.

"Dad?"

"Mm?"

"When I go to the Academy. When I learn the formula. If I keep listening — will they let me do both?"

He stood in the burrow entrance, his silhouette against the last of the light, and was quiet for a moment that stretched.

"I don't know," he said. "I hope so. For your sake, I hope so." He turned just slightly — not to look at me, but enough that I knew he had. "I'll tell you this, and it's the only thing I'm certain enough to pass on: when you find yourself in a room where you must choose between being accurate and being safe, choose accurate. The earth keeps records. The Tally forgets. And you'll have to live with yourself in the dark, when the Glow-Panels are off and the formulas don't apply, and in those hours accuracy is the only company that stays."

He went inside.

I stayed, paws flat on the clay, and listened to the earth breathe.

The eucalyptus moved. The city glowed distant, convinced of its own importance, believing itself the only light.

I listened.
