# Chapter 4: The Melborow Frequency

<!--
BONUS IMAGE PROMPT: Chapter Cover Image
Epic composition for Chapter 4: Hoebat the wombat standing in the rain of the Gray Grotto, trowel in paw, surrounded by the darkness of failing infrastructure. Behind him, the distant blue glow of the Melborow Frequency. Before him, deeper darkness where he works. Ghost images overlay: Pokero's golden eyes in firelight, the five Kappa Mu members in the Root Chamber, Cooroo screaming in the dawn. The rain falls on concrete and fur. Tagline: "The Melborow Frequency." Style: noir urban fantasy, rain effects, layered composition, blue and gray palette with touches of firelight and violet.

### The Grotto

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Gray Grotto
The Gray Grotto district of Melborow - a wombat city in the rain. Gray, heavy, oily drizzle that doesn't fall but arrives, carrying rust and neglected drainage. Underground tunnel streets with smashed streetlights, sagging tunnel roofs, cracks in the Grout where water pools. The Glow-Panels flicker in the distance, Council-approved blue light. Two wombats - Hoebat and Lolaboo - stand under a rusted awning. Lolaboo holds a BorowFinder app with a blue glow painting her fur. The atmosphere is abandonment made visible. Style: urban fantasy noir, wet surfaces, neon glow in distance, decaying infrastructure, melancholic atmosphere.
-->

The rain in Melborow doesn't fall. It settles. Like a bad landlord who already knows you can't afford to move — it just makes itself comfortable and waits for you to get tired first.

Gray. Heavy. Tastes like rust and someone else's unpaid maintenance bill, sliding down from Queensborow — where they sorted the drainage a decade ago — to pool in the alleys of the Gray Grotto, where the **relief drains** were capped to run more **utility conduits** through. When the rains hit hard, the water has nowhere to go but through the **seepage walls** into the **unlined tunnels** where the Lo Snouts live. The Council has a name for this. "Perimeter redistribution." The Lo Snouts have a name for it too. They call it drowning.

I don't mind rain. Rain means the group swells — more wombats needing dry tunnels assessed, dry tunnels shored up, dry work done by paws that know the difference between substrate that wants to hold and substrate that's already made its peace with collapsing. Rain means I can feel the earth through my paws, which is the only honest conversation left in this city.

But this rain is different. This rain is not weather. This rain is a report.

IMAGE PROMPT 12: The Deep Conduit
Cross-section view of the Deep Conduit - not a wombat dig but a Council excavation bored through bedrock with drills and lined with Safety Grout. The Sump Line runs through it - climate-controlled pods carrying High-Noses between Cathedral and Queensborow. Weep lines feeding Frequency cables through service chases. Collection sumps clogged with silt. Relief drains capped for more utility conduits. Above, storm water has nowhere to go but through seepage walls into unlined tunnels where Lo Snouts live. The Council calls it "perimeter redistribution." Style: industrial cross-section, infrastructure critique, class stratification, engineering diagram meets social commentary.
-->

Three levels down, the **Deep Conduit** hums. Not a wombat dig. A Council excavation — drills, **Safety Grout**, cost overruns they buried in the supplementary **Tallies** where no one reads them. The High-Noses ride the **Sump Line** in climate-controlled pods, ferried between the Cathedral and Queensborow without feeling so much as a vibration from the substrate they borrowed money against and never paid back. I know because I helped install the first **weep lines** that fed the Frequency cables through the **service chase** running parallel to the main flow. I was proud of that work. Called it progress. I was younger and less honest with myself then — not by much, but enough.

The **Deep Conduit** was supposed to be dual-purpose: transit below, storm management above. The **collection sumps** were going to be cleared on a maintenance schedule. The schedule existed. It was in the documents. I saw it. What also existed, in subsequent documents I did not see until later, was the decision to cap the **relief drains** — those emergency overflows meant to protect the lower borows — to make room for more utility conduits, because the Frequency needed more cable, and the Frequency was making someone rich.

The Council calls the result "perimeter redistribution."

I call it what it is.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 27: Temporal Cropping
A street in the Gray Grotto showing Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code: Temporal Cropping. The lights stopped working six months ago. Services withdrawn systematically to make residents leave voluntarily. A sagging tunnel roof three burrows down. A hairline fracture in the lining where water pools. Street signs still claim "up-and-coming" and "emerging district with character." But the signs are weathered, the marketing a lie. The Council pulls resources back to the center, hollowing the periphery. Style: urban decay, institutional neglect, false advertising vs. reality, melancholy atmosphere, critique of gentrification.
-->

Above us, the **Glow-Panels** flicker in the distance. The ones that still work. Bioluminescent tiles, powered by the Frequency itself, broadcasting as they illuminate — every light in this city is also a speaker, every step you take beneath them is also being sung to. The Council's great innovation: infrastructure that talks at you while it serves you, like a shop that plays you music so you don't notice the prices going up.

"Signal's weak," Lolaboo mutters beside me. She's tapping the BorowFinder app, blue glow washing her fur into something that doesn't belong in this alley. She doesn't belong in this alley. She's Queensborow — upper levels, working drainage, the kind of wombat who still thinks the Frequency is talking *to* her rather than *at* her, who reads "emerging district with character" and hears something other than a eulogy. "Seventy meters. Almost there."

Seventy meters. I look down the alley and I read it the way a doctor reads a body — not from a chart but from the hands, from decades of pressing your paws against earth and feeling whether it wants to hold or whether the will has gone out of it. The sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down. The hairline fracture in the **lining** where water has been pooling, patient and inevitable, finding its way in the way water always finds its way in. And in the foundation cracks — faint, but I know exactly what that shimmer is — the blue-white geometry of **Static** colonisation, hexagonal and precise, working its way into the concrete from below.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 18: The Static Colonization
Close-up of tunnel foundation cracks showing the faint luminescence of Static colonization. Hexagonal crystal formations pushing upward through Grout like frost through soil - geometric intrusions that have tried to tile and failed, or are still trying. The transition zone where the crystal meets the organic. Hoebat's paws examining the crack, feeling whether the substrate still wants to hold or if the will has gone out of it. The blue emergency lighting makes the crystal glow eerily. Style: body horror (architectural), crystal textures, invasion of the geometric, close-up detail, eerie lighting.
-->

This building isn't dying. It's converting.

The lights in this district stopped working six months ago. The Council has a term for this too — Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code: **Temporal Cropping**. Services reduced systematically, staged over a period of months, designed to prompt voluntary departure prior to scheduled redevelopment. Voluntary. That's the word they use. As if a wombat choosing between a leaking roof and no roof at all is making a free choice. As if the wombat who leaves quietly costs the Council nothing, and the wombat who stays is the problem.

"They call it 'up-and-coming,'" Lolaboo says. Her paw tightens around mine. She wants to believe the marketing. I understand it. Believing things is easier than the alternative. "Emerging district with character."

"Yeah," I say. "It's got character."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 16: The Melborow Frequency Tower
The Melborow Frequency infrastructure - towers broadcasting the constant low-grade thrum that fills every tunnel. Blue-lit Glow-Panels powered by the Frequency itself, bioluminescent tiles invented by Muskbat. The Cathedral in the background - center of Council power. The Frequency represents digital infrastructure, networked lights, comforting buzz of connectivity - and the lies it carries. Everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations crumbling. The architecture is polished, modern, deceptive. Style: sci-fi cityscape, blue lighting, technological facade, underlying decay, propaganda made visible.
-->

Then the hum stops.

Not the rain. Rain doesn't care about any of this — rain just keeps falling on everyone equally, which is more than the Council ever managed. But the Melborow Frequency — that constant low-grade thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment in this city — cuts. Clean. Gone. Like a hand leaving a cheek.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Frequency Dies
Absolute darkness in the underground city. The Melborow Frequency has cut out - no digital hum, no networked lights, no comforting connectivity. Just two wombat shapes barely visible under a rusted awning, listening to rain and silence. Lolaboo's app has died, the blue light vanished. The silence has mass, temperature, presses against their fur like water. In the distance, the faint glow of a trash fire. The real frequency - deep geological murmur of substrate shifting - can almost be heard. Style: total darkness with minimal light sources, atmospheric tension, sensory deprivation, fear and anticipation.
-->

Lolaboo's app dies with it. Blue light gone. Two shapes under a rusted awning with nothing but rain and dark.

Here is something surface creatures never get to know: silence underground has weight. It presses against your fur. Fills the ear like clay. And in the space the Frequency just left empty, if you are very still, if you have spent your working life with your paws against earth learning its actual voice — you can hear the real thing. Deep. Geological. Slow. The substrate talking to itself the way it has been talking since long before any Council bored their conduits through it. The sound the Frequency was built, in part, to cover.

"Hoebat?" Lolaboo's voice is small.

"Don't move."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: The Lost Dingoes Emerge
Three Lost Dingoes emerging from a storm drain in the darkness of the Gray Grotto. Lean, rib-thin, moving with jagged grace. Creatures of appetite without purpose - what happens when a Dingo's covenant with the world breaks down. Their eyes catch distant trash-fire light, reflecting gold on black - predator optics. They circle Hoebat and Lolaboo, who press together in fear. The lead Scavenger has a scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. Rain drips behind them. Style: horror-tinged urban fantasy, predator silhouettes, golden eye reflections, threat implied, rain-slicked darkness.
-->

From the storm drain, three shapes. Lean. Rib-thin. Moving with the particular kind of grace that comes off an animal with nothing left to lose. Lost Dingoes. Scavengers.

They circle. Eyes catching the distant trash-fire light, gold on black. Predator optics.

Lolaboo presses into my flank. I feel the heat of her fear changing the air between us — and the Dingoes read it. Fear has a geography. Flows downhill. Pools at the lowest point.

Right now, that's us.

"Hoebat," she whispers. "They're going to—"

"Stay still."

My voice goes down low. Gravel. Almost subsonic. Not a fighting voice — wombats don't fight, we hold, we take the weight and stand in it until the physics sorts itself out. But I wasn't reaching for a weapon. I was reaching back into twenty years of memory, looking for something specific.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: Lambda Class Survival Mission
Hoebat and Pokero by a campfire on the dry plains, years earlier. Lambda class survival mission, third night. Embers dying, jerky gone. Pokero - a younger Dingo with the scar above his eye visible - is explaining the Haiku game to Hoebat. The dry plains press around them like a held breath. Cricket-song fills the pauses. Pokero's golden eyes catch firelight reluctantly. Hoebat listens, ears alert. Stars visible above. The moment of friendship forming across species lines. Style: warm firelight, night scene, intimate conversation, character bond forming, atmospheric landscape.
-->

### The Campfire

Lambda class scattered us across the dry plains with a waterskin and the instruction to "maintain composure," which translated differently depending on what you were. For Pokero, it meant not hunting the Wallaby pair we could hear crying in the dark three klicks east. For me, it meant not digging a hole and sitting in it until the sun came back, which was my honest first instinct and I'm not ashamed of it.

We were the last two in our sector. The others had found their way back to base. Pokero and I stayed. We'd run enough scenarios together to know each other's tells — he went quiet when he was hunting, I dug when I was anxious, neither of us commented on the other's methods.

The fire was down to embers. The jerky was long gone. Pokero had been watching the stars for an hour without a word, which could mean he was thinking or could mean he was tracking something I couldn't hear. Then he turned and said: "You know why Dingoes like Haiku?"

"Because anything longer counts as a long-term commitment?"

One side of his mouth pulled up, slow, like a dry leaf catching fire at the edge. "We compress our ideas into compact rhythms," he said. "Vibes. Haiku are pocket-sized vibes. We collect them and detonate them on each other." He tapped the side of his head. "And here's the thing about vibes that your mob never clocks — they don't broadcast. They precipitate. You're not sending anything out. The room already has it. You're just making it impossible to deny."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The Haiku Game
Close-up of Pokero and Hoebat facing each other across dying embers, engaged in the Haiku battle. Pokero's expression intense, teeth glinting, one side of his mouth curling in a smile. Hoebat's posture is defensive but determined. Between them, three lines drawn in the dust: the 3-7-5 structure. The air is charged with competitive tension. In the background, the dark plains and distant howl of a Pack running its circuit. Firelight paints their faces in orange and shadow. Style: intense character interaction, fire-lit portraits, cultural exchange, game as combat, intimate framing.
-->

He leaned forward into the firelight. "You think Dingo culture is about territory? It's not. Not really. It's about flow state. Think we're all just killers? Any idiot can rip a throat out. That's messy. Low-frequency. You spend half the next day washing blood out of your fur and the other half limping. Inefficient." He settled back. "When the Pack stops running, we sit around the fire and we drop haiku. Fifteen syllables. That's the blade. You cut someone with fifteen syllables, their composure breaks. A bitten leg heals. A broken ego doesn't. That's how rank moves in the Pack."

He picked up a stick and drew three lines in the dust between us.

"3-7-5. That's the rhythm." He snapped the stick. "That's where the flow lives. We mostly battle in Quenya — Pack-Talk, every sound weighted, precise. But beauty can be found in the common tongue too. There's a truth in the dirt that polished stone doesn't have."

He looked at me. "I'll start."

That was the moment. Not the brother's oath. Not when we navigated the Shattered Gorge blind. That night on the dry plains with cricket-song filling every pause between us — that was when I knew Pokero was my friend.

He went into his hip-hop cadence, each syllable landing clean and deliberate:

> *Wombat feet.*
> *Masked with clay. All day. Pewtrid*
> *Noses do not lie.*

Landed. My ears went flat. Three syllables like a jab, seven like a hook, five like a body shot — the anatomy of the insult was as precise as its content.

I counted seven slow breaths. Fire crackled. Night-bird screamed somewhere out in the dark.

> *Dingo dreams.*
> *What red rider? What sharp teeth?*
> *Hood up. Wolf down. Shanked.*

Pokero's ears swivelled forward. One beat. Two. Then he bark-laughed — loud enough to spook something in the scrub, loud enough that I knew I'd won the round.

"Not bad, digger."

He wasn't done. He stretched his legs out, crossed his paws, and came back with the full set showing:

> *Chew on this.*
> *Tasty wombats I have had.*
> *Count your friends. Zero.*

The fire popped. I sat with that for a moment. Because he wasn't wrong — I was the weirdo in Lambda class, the one who talked to soil samples and dug holes under pressure, the one nobody partnered with until Pokero did. He knew exactly where to put the blade.

I let the silence go three seconds. Four. Then:

> *Choke it down.*
> *Wombat penis fills your throat.*
> *Swallow good doggie.*

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The Secret Verses
Artistic representation of the two private haikus floating in the air between Pokero and Hoebat, visualized as glowing text or calligraphy. Pokero's verse about "fat paws press dead ground" in harsh, angular script. Hoebat's response about "look where the dingoes are blind" in more grounded, earthy lettering. The fire is embers now. The night is deep. The verses hang between them like a secret handshake made of breath - fifteen syllables each, passed across the species line. Style: typographic art, poetic visualization, intimate night scene, warm ember light, textual beauty.
-->

Pokero froze. Ears flat, then forward, then flat again. That terrible moment where I genuinely did not know if I had crossed from game to war. Then he threw his head back and *howled* — long and real, carrying across the dry plains, waking everything that lived within three klicks.

"Okay," he said, when he got his breath back. "Okay. You got me. You actually got me."

Then he went still. Face settled into something calm and private. And he delivered:

> *Fat paws dead.*
> *Blinded by the hollow root.*
> *Graveyard for a home.*

I walked the scrub with that for a few minutes. Feeling the shape of it. The accuracy. A good diagnosis hurts because it's true — because it names the thing you've been carrying and pretending not to. Then I gave him my answer:

> *Shun the light.*
> *Reaping where dingoes are blind.*
> *Shadows hold our lives.*

He didn't say anything for a long time. Embers shifted. Night-bird called from somewhere not on any map.

"Not bad," he said finally. "For a digger."

Highest compliment a Dingo gives. We went several more rounds over shooting stars and dying fire — me in his language, in Pack-Talk, fifteen syllables each passed between us like a secret handshake made of breath. Two creatures who had no business understanding each other, proving they did.


### The Warning

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 20: The Lead Scavenger
Close-up of the lead Lost Dingo Scavenger - scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. Lean, rib-thin, desperation in his golden eyes. He's three meters from Hoebat, close enough to smell his breath (rot and hunger), frozen mid-lunge by the Watcher's Frequency. Rain drips from his matted fur. The alley behind him is dark, wet concrete, trash. He sees prey - soft flesh, easy calories, Queensborow smell of soap and safety. Style: predator portrait, threat moment, rain effects, urban decay, character detail.
-->

Back in the alley. The lead Scavenger lunges. Scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. He sees prey — soft flesh, easy calories, a Queensborow smell of soap and safety that tells him we are not from here and nobody is coming for us.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Watcher's Frequency
Hoebat the wombat squaring his shoulders in the rain, adopting Section 8.2 posture - symmetry, load-bearing stance. His center of gravity dropped, finding purchase on wet concrete. From his throat comes the Watcher's Frequency: Click-clack, hiss, pause. The rhythmic pattern that says to any Dingo: "I am not prey. I am recognised. I carry knowledge worth preserving." Lolaboo presses against his flank, terrified. The Lost Dingoes freeze mid-circle, ears swiveling. The Code hits them like a physical thing. Style: defensive stance, moment of power, sound visualization, tension, rain-soaked heroism.
-->

I drop my center of gravity. Find the concrete with my paws — wet, but solid enough. Square my shoulders. Section 8.2: symmetry, load-bearing stance, the posture that says *I am not moving. You cannot push me, pull me, shift me. Try the physics and find out.*

From my throat, I make the sound.

*Click-clack, hiss, pause.*

Then the words. Dingo-Tongue. Harsh vowels that scrape on the way out:

*"Bone is dry. Marrow gone. Seek the Dying. Hunt not the Living."*

Three meters away, the Scavenger freezes.

The freeze tells me he knows the Code. The old law — *Friend of the Pack* — it's in him somewhere under all that hunger. I can see it in the way his ears swivel back. Something fighting something.

The hunger is winning.

He's calculating. Ancient covenant versus the weight of an empty stomach, and I cannot tell you which one wins tonight, because—

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: Pokero in the Firelight
Pokero the Dingo stepping into the firelight from deeper darkness. Larger than the Scavengers, composed, not hungry but present. His golden eyes catch the light - patient as held breath. Country dust washed off, replaced by Melborow grime, but the eyes are the same. He looks at Hoebat with recognition, at Lolaboo with assessment. The Lost Dingoes scatter around him like smoke. One sharp yelp - command, dismissal. The alley is wet concrete, trash-fire glow, rain. Pokero stands in a puddle reflecting firelight. Style: dramatic entrance, predator authority, fire-lit scene, rain effects, character reunion.
-->

The air in the alley changes. Something larger is present. The Scavengers feel it before I do.

Pokero steps into the firelight.

Harder in the city. Sharper — like he's been through the whetstone a few extra times since the plains. Country dust long gone, replaced with Melborow grime. But the eyes — golden, patient as a held breath — those are the same eyes that watched me fumble Pack-Talk vowels by the campfire and didn't say a word about it until I got them right.

He doesn't bark. Doesn't growl. One sharp yelp. Command. Dismissal.

The Scavengers scatter like smoke.

"You always did have a big mouth, Hoebat," he says. Voice like gravel rolled in smoke. "Heard you halfway from the surface. Does a digger have a death wish, or did you know I'd be around?"

"Looking for a home. Thought the Council sold honest burrows."

"The Council sells lies with good lighting." A glance at Lolaboo. "Both of you smell like Queensborow. You stuck out in there like a bad seam in fresh Grout."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 17: The Wall
The Wall - Trumbat's endless concrete ribbon bisecting the horizon like a scar the city gave itself on purpose. It rises above the Gray Grotto, separating the Dead Zones from the "developed" areas. Pokero stands before it, looking up, knowing it won't stop what's coming - walls just make abandonment fester, trap it inside with the living. The Wall is gray, brutal, geometric. Behind it, the glow of Queensborow. Before it, the darkness of the Grotto. Rain falls on concrete. Style: brutalist architecture, social division, rain-slicked concrete, character dwarfed by structure, dystopian urban planning.
-->

He turns, and his gaze finds the Wall in the distance — Trumbat's great project, the concrete ribbon rising against a sky the colour of a bruise.

"I've seen the schematics," he says. Low enough that it barely carries over the rain. "I've sat in the meetings. Listened to Trumbat sell it to the delegation." A short, humourless sound that isn't quite a laugh. "He calls it 'civic armature.' Says it'll protect you."

He looks at me. Golden eyes burning steady in the dark. "That Wall isn't for keeping things out, Hoebat. It's for keeping you *in*. It's a lid."

"You've definitely helped change our minds."

"Good." Sharp as cracking bone. "This place is dead tissue. We hunt here because there's nothing left to damage — you understand what that means? Nothing. Left. The Council isn't neglecting the Grotto. They're finishing it off." He glances at Lolaboo. "Keep her close. The Soft-Paws who wander alone out here don't wander long."

Then his voice drops.

> *Shun the rot.*
> *Seek not, for dingoes do hunt.*
> *Your walls hold your dead.*

Then he's back in the dark. There one moment, rain and shadow the next.

Part of me wants to go after him. *Years, Pokero. Not a word, not a signal, nothing.* The anger is solid and specific — sits in my gut like a stone with sharp edges. But the part of me that felt the Scavenger calculating in those three seconds before Pokero arrived knows I would be in pieces on the wet concrete right now without him. So I hold both things: fury and gratitude, the way you hold two contradictory truths that refuse to cancel each other out.

The Frequency hums back to life. Sickly yellow flicker first, then the lights returning one by one. The electronic hymn: *everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations.*

Lolaboo's app reboots. Cheerful chime. *Seventy meters. Great investment opportunity.*

"How did you do that?" she breathes.

"We wombats believe the world is math," I say. "The Dingoes know better. Their world is a song. Get the rhythm wrong" — I nod toward the storm drain the Scavengers came from — "and it eats you."

I'm already walking. Paws in puddles.

"We're not buying here, Lolaboo."

"But the listing — the app said—"

"The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies." I don't break stride. "Let's go."


### The Cipher

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 9: The Cipher Walk
Hoebat walking through rain-soaked Gray Grotto alleys with Lolaboo following, his mind working on the two haikus. The tunnel around them is dark, wet, abandoned. His paws splash through puddles. The Frequency's yellow flicker casts intermittent light. His face is focused, internal, working out the cipher. Above the words of the two haikus float visually: "Shun the light / Reaping where dingoes are blind / Shadows hold our lives" and "Shun the rot / Seek not, for dingoes do hunt / Your walls hold your dead." Style: solitary figure, rain, thought-sequence visualization, textual overlay, atmospheric urban.
-->

Rain doesn't stop. My mind is a grinding stone — two haikus working against each other, edges catching.

The first: the verse I gave Pokero on the dry plains, the one that ended the stupid grin on his face:

> *Shun the light.*
> *Reaping where dingoes are blind.*
> *Shadows hold our lives.*

The second: what he just passed me in the alley:

> *Shun the rot.*
> *Seek not, for dingoes do hunt.*
> *Your walls hold your dead.*

Thirty seconds earlier, with the Scavenger three meters from my face, I had reached back into memory and pulled up that campfire. Those words. *Shun the light. Reaping where dingoes are blind. Shadows hold our lives.* I'd been running them in my head like a frequency — because that's what I'd learned from Pokero, that's how I'd survived a hundred bad situations since: tune to the right vibe, hold it, don't break.

And Pokero had felt it. Somewhere in that dark, in the rain, before he'd shown his face — he'd felt the exact verse playing in my head and answered it. Not guessed. Not deduced. *Felt it.* The way he'd said it, years ago by that fire: *they don't broadcast. They precipitate. The room already has it. You're just making it impossible to deny.*

And there it was. Undeniable.

Then the analytical brain kicked in, because that's what it does, because feelings are data and data needs processing.

I see the substitutions first, because that's the easy layer. *Light* becomes *rot*. The passive *reaping* becomes the active *seek not*. *Shadows* become *walls*. That's a tonal shift — from endurance to urgency. Pokero moving the register up a notch. That's the surface read, and he knows I'll go deeper.

The real message isn't in what changed. It's in what stayed.

Filter out the variables. Hold the constants.

*...the dingoes...*
*...hold...*

The dingoes hold.

Not holding position. Holding to the pact. To the oath we all took under the Jacaranda. Pokero's faction — not the Scavengers in the alley, not the Lost Ones, but the ones who still know the Code, who still battle in fifteen syllables instead of teeth — they are holding to the Kappa Mu.

But then the second line hits me properly.

*Seek not, for dingoes do hunt.*

Not *seek not where.* Not a navigation instruction. A comma. A full stop. And then the reason: *for dingoes do hunt.* Don't look for us. We are already looking. We are already moving.

This is not an activation signal telling me to go find Pokero. It's telling me to stop moving and hold my ground — because the dingoes are already on the hunt, and they will find me.

Which means the Kappa Mu is already in motion. Which means something happened that I don't know about yet. Something that put Pokero in a Council meeting, listening to Trumbat's schematics and deciding today was the day to break cover after years of nothing.

And the others. Bash. Cooroo. Merl. Wherever they are, whatever they're buried in — are they getting their own signals? Their own versions of this, in their own languages? Pokero wouldn't move the whole board unless all five were needed. The prophecy says all five. Which means they're out there. And if the dingoes are hunting, they'll be found too.

I just have to not be an idiot about where I stand while I wait.

Trumbat is building a lid for this city. The Frequency is singing everyone to sleep inside it. The Static is working its geometry up through the foundation cracks while the **Tallies** refuse to name what it is.

And somewhere out there — Cooroo screaming at dawn in the bush, Bash with his hands in somebody else's disaster, Merl running whatever the long game is — all of us doing our own separate thing while the ground shifts under all of us.

Hold position. The dingoes have come.
