BONUS IMAGE PROMPT: Chapter Cover Image
Epic composition for Chapter 3: Hoebat the wombat standing in the rain of the Gray Grotto, trowel in paw, surrounded by the darkness of failing infrastructure. Behind him, the distant blue glow of the Melborow Frequency. Before him, deeper darkness where he works. Ghost images overlay: Pokero's golden eyes in firelight, the five Kappa Mu members in the Root Chamber, Cooroo screaming in the dawn. The rain falls on concrete and fur. Tagline: "The Melborow Frequency." Style: noir urban fantasy, rain effects, layered composition, blue and gray palette with touches of firelight and violet.

### The Gutter

IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Gray Grotto
The Gray Grotto district of Melborow - a wombat city in the rain. Gray, heavy, oily drizzle that doesn't fall but arrives, carrying rust and neglected drainage. Underground tunnel streets with smashed streetlights, sagging tunnel roofs, cracks in the Grout where water pools. The Glow-Panels flicker in the distance, Council-approved blue light. Two wombats - Hoebat and Lolaboo - stand under a rusted awning. Lolaboo holds a BorowFinder app with a blue glow painting her fur. The atmosphere is abandonment made visible. Style: urban fantasy noir, wet surfaces, neon glow in distance, decaying infrastructure, melancholic atmosphere.
-->

There is a kind of condensation that doesn't fall. It arrives. It takes up residence in the air the way grief takes up residence in the body — not descending from above but materialising from within, as though the atmosphere itself had remembered something unbearable and begun to weep.

The rain in Melborow is that kind.

Gray, heavy, carrying the taste of rust and neglected drainage from the heights of Queensborow to pool in the alleys of the Gray Grotto. It finds every crack where the render has failed, every wound the High-Noses left unattended, every seam in the concrete that the Council pretends doesn't exist. It is the city's own sweat. Melborow perspiring through its infrastructure, leaking through its skin, confessing through its pores what its ledgers refuse to admit: that something underneath has gone terribly wrong.

I don't mind rain. Not usually. Rain means the group swells. Swelling means work, and work means I can feel the earth through my paws, which is the only honest conversation left in this city. But this rain — this oily, persistent drizzle — feels different. Heavier. Rain as atmosphere. Rain as diagnosis. Rain that doesn't clean the city so much as reveal it, the way a wet cloth reveals the grain of wood that polish has been hiding.

The grain of the Gray Grotto is abandonment.

IMAGE PROMPT 12: The Deep Conduit
Cross-section view of the Deep Conduit - not a wombat dig but a Council excavation bored through bedrock with drills and lined with Safety Grout. The Sump Line runs through it - climate-controlled pods carrying High-Noses between Cathedral and Queensborow. Weep lines feeding Frequency cables through service chases. Collection sumps clogged with silt. Relief drains capped for more utility conduits. Above, storm water has nowhere to go but through seepage walls into unlined tunnels where Lo Snouts live. The Council calls it "perimeter redistribution." Style: industrial cross-section, infrastructure critique, class stratification, engineering diagram meets social commentary.
-->

Three levels down, the **Deep Conduit** hums—not a wombat dig but a Council excavation, bored through bedrock with drills and lined with **Safety Grout**. The High-Noses ride the **Sump Line** in climate-controlled pods, buffered from the substrate's vibration, ferried between the Cathedral and Queensborow on rails bolted into the **tunnel crown**. I helped install the first **weep lines** that fed the Frequency cables through the **service chase** running parallel to the main flow. I remember when we called it progress.

The Deep Conduit was supposed to be **dual-purpose**: transit below, **storm management** above. But the **collection sumps** clog with silt the Council never budgets to clear, and the **relief drains**—those emergency overflows meant to protect the lower borows—were capped to make room for more **utility conduits**. When the rains come hard, the water has nowhere to go but through the **seepage walls** into the **unlined tunnels** where the Lo Snouts live. The Council calls this "perimeter redistribution." The Lo Snouts call it drowning.

IMAGE PROMPT 27: Temporal Cropping
A street in the Gray Grotto showing Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code: Temporal Cropping. The lights stopped working six months ago. Services withdrawn systematically to make residents leave voluntarily. A sagging tunnel roof three burrows down. A hairline fracture in the **lining** where water pools. Street signs still claim "up-and-coming" and "emerging district with character." But the signs are weathered, the marketing a lie. The Council pulls resources back to the center, hollowing the periphery. Style: urban decay, institutional neglect, false advertising vs. reality, melancholy atmosphere, critique of gentrification.
-->

Above us, the Glow-Panels flicker in the distance—the ones that still work. They're the Council's innovation: bioluminescent tiles powered by the Frequency itself, broadcasting as they illuminate, singing the Melborow hymn in visible light.

"Signal's weak," Lolaboo mutters. Her claw taps the BorowFinder app, that blue glow casting her in the sterile light of the Frequency. She looks like a creature from a different world — which she is. Queensborow. Upper levels. The kind of wombat who still believes the Frequency is singing to her, not at her. "Seventy meters. Almost there."

Seventy meters. It's not the distance that matters here—it's the abandonment. The lights in this district stopped working six months ago. A beautiful phrase, that. The bureaucratic poetry of planned abandonment. Let the periphery decay. Focus resources on the Cathedral. On the projects that look good in reports.

The Melborow Frequency infrastructure - towers broadcasting the constant low-grade thrum that fills every tunnel. Blue-lit Glow-Panels powered by the Frequency itself, bioluminescent tiles invented by Muskbat. The Cathedral in the background - center of Council power. The Frequency represents digital infrastructure, networked lights, comforting buzz of connectivity - and the lies it carries. Everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations crumbling. The architecture is polished, modern, deceptive. Style: sci-fi cityscape, blue lighting, technological facade, underlying decay, propaganda made visible.
-->


"They call it 'up-and-coming,'" Lolaboo says, her paw tightening around mine. She wants to believe the marketing. We both do. "Emerging district with character."

I look down the alley, reading the texture of dark. I see what her app can't show: the sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down, the hairline fracture in the **lining** where water pools, the faint luminescence of Static colonisation in the foundation cracks. Each sign a word in a sentence the place is writing about its own death.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 18: The Static Colonization
Close-up of tunnel foundation cracks showing the faint luminescence of Static colonization. Hexagonal crystal formations pushing upward through Grout like frost through soil - geometric intrusions that have tried to tile and failed, or are still trying. The transition zone where the crystal meets the organic. Hoebat's paws examining the crack, feeling whether the substrate still wants to hold or if the will has gone out of it. The blue emergency lighting makes the crystal glow eerily. Style: body horror (architectural), crystal textures, invasion of the geometric, close-up detail, eerie lighting.
-->

The Council calls them "transitioning neighbourhoods." "Development-pending areas." But I know the signs the way you know the signs in a body — not from the textbook but from the hands. From years of pressing your paws against substrate and feeling whether it wants to hold or whether the will has gone out of it. The smashed streetlights aren't vandalism. They're policy. Slow withdrawal of services designed to make residents leave voluntarily, so the Council won't have to pay for relocation when the inevitable happens.


<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Frequency Dies
Absolute darkness in the underground city. The Melborow Frequency has cut out - no digital hum, no networked lights, no comforting connectivity. Just two wombat shapes barely visible under a rusted awning, listening to rain and silence. Lolaboo's app has died, the blue light vanished. The silence has mass, temperature, presses against their fur like water. In the distance, the faint glow of a trash fire. The real frequency - deep geological murmur of substrate shifting - can almost be heard. Style: total darkness with minimal light sources, atmospheric tension, sensory deprivation, fear and anticipation.
-->

The hum dies.

Not the rain. The rain keeps falling, indifferent. But the Melborow Frequency — that constant, low-grade thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment — cuts out. The digital infrastructure, the networked lights, the comforting buzz of connectivity: all of it, gone. Like a hand withdrawing from a cheek. Like the last note of a song you didn't know you were listening to until it stopped.

Lolaboo's app dies. The blue light vanishes. We stand in absolute dark, two shapes under a rusted awning, listening to rain and silence.

There is a quality to silence in underground places that surface creatures never know. It has mass. It has temperature. It presses against your fur like water, fills your ears like clay, and in the space where the Frequency used to be you can hear — if you are very still, if you have spent decades pressing your paws into earth — the actual voice of the ground. The deep, slow, geological murmur of substrate shifting against substrate. The real frequency. The one the Council's broadcast was designed to drown out.

"Hoebat?" Her voice is small.

"Don't move," I say.

I don't say *don't make a sound*. Sound doesn't matter anymore. Whatever's out there isn't hunting by noise. It's hunting by smell. By heat. By the chemical signature of those who wandered too far from the upper levels.

Creatures of appetite without purpose - what happens when a Dingo's covenant with the world breaks down. Their eyes catch distant trash-fire light, reflecting gold on black - predator optics. They circle Hoebat and Lolaboo, who press together in fear. The lead Scavenger has a scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. Rain drips behind them. Style: horror-tinged urban fantasy, predator silhouettes, golden eye reflections, threat implied, rain-slicked darkness.
-->

From the storm drain they come. Three shapes. Lean, rib-thin, moving with jagged grace. Lost Dingoes. Scavengers. The ones who fell out of the Pack structure, who only know hunger and desperation. They are what happens when a creature's covenant with the world breaks down and nothing fills the gap — not code, not instinct, not belonging. Just appetite. That's what a Lost Dingo is. The reflection that escaped. The hunger that used to serve a purpose now serving only itself.

They circle. Eyes catching distant trash-fire light, reflecting gold on black. Predator optics.

Lolaboo presses against my flank. I feel her trembling. I feel something else too: the heat of her fear changing the air between us, creating a micro-climate of panic that the Dingoes read like a map. Fear has a geography. It flows downhill. It pools in the lowest place. Right now, the lowest place is us.

"Hoebat," she whispers. "They're going to—"

"Stay still."

My voice is gravel. Low. Almost subsonic. It is not a fighting voice. Wombats don't fight. We endure. We hold weight until weight becomes architecture. We stand beneath collapsing ceilings and wait for the physics to notice we haven't moved.

Instead of a weapon, I dug deep into my memories.

### The Campfire

By the third night of our survival mission, we'd run out of things to guard against. The Lambda class had scattered us across the dry plains with nothing but a waterskin and the instruction to "maintain composure," which meant different things depending on whether you were a Dingo or a wombat. For Pokero, it meant not hunting the Wallaby pair we'd heard crying in the dark three klicks east. For me, it meant not digging a hole and hiding in it until the sun came back.

We were the only two left in our assigned sector. The others had found their way back to base. Pokero and I stayed. We'd been squadmates long enough to know each other's rhythms—he'd learned that I dug when I was nervous; I'd learned that he went silent when he was hunting.

The fire was down to embers. The jerky was gone. And Pokero—who'd been staring at the stars for an hour without speaking—suddenly said: "You know why Dingoes like Haikus?"

"Because anything longer than that counts as a long-term commitment?"

He smiled, one side of his mouth curling up like a dry leaf catching fire. "We compress our ideas into compact rhythms," he said. "Vibes. We're all about vibes. And Haikus are like little compack vibes that we jab at each other with."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The Haiku Game
Close-up of Pokero and Hoebat facing each other across dying embers, engaged in the Haiku battle. Pokero's expression intense, teeth glinting, one side of his mouth curling in a smile. Hoebat's posture is defensive but determined. Between them, three lines drawn in the dust: the 3-7-5 structure. The air is charged with competitive tension. In the background, the dark plains and distant howl of a Pack running its circuit. Firelight paints their faces in orange and shadow. Style: intense character interaction, fire-lit portraits, cultural exchange, game as combat, intimate framing.
-->

"Dingo culture isn't about territory, digger. Not really. It's about flow state. You think we're just killers? Any idiot can rip a throat out. That's messy. That's low-frequency. You spend half the next day washing blood out of your fur and the other half limping. It's inefficient."

He leaned in, firelight catching the sharp angles of his face. "When the pack stops running around looking for our next meal, we sit around the fire like this and we start fighting each other.

"Fifteen syllables. That's the blade. You cut someone with that. Their composure breaks. And in the Pack, a broken ego is fatal. You can heal a bitten leg, but you can't heal being made to look like a fool in front of the pack."

He settled back. "Numerology. Vibration. Everything coming together in syllable counts."

"We mostly battle in Quenya. The Pack-Talk. It's precise. Every sound carries weight. But beauty..." He opened his eyes, looked at me. "Beauty can be found in the common tongue too. There's a truth in the dirt that the polished stones don't have."

He picked up a stick, drew three lines in the dust between us.

"3-7-5. That's the rythm." He snapped the stick. "That's where the flow lives. That's where you find out who you really are when the structure pins you down."

He turned then, those too-sharp teeth glinting. "I'll start, digger."

That was the moment I knew. Not when we swore the brother's oath together. Not when we navigated the Shattered Gorge blind. That night, with the dry plains pressing around us like a held breath and every pause between us filled with cricket-song and the far-off howl of a Pack running its circuit, his golden eyes catching firelight the way the scrub catches dawn—reluctantly - that was when I knew Pokero was my friend.

Pokero's verse about "fat paws press dead ground" in harsh, angular script. Hoebat's response about "look where the dingoes are blind" in more grounded, earthy lettering. The fire is embers now. The night is deep. The verses hang between them like a secret handshake made of breath - fifteen syllables each, passed across the species line. Style: typographic art, poetic visualization, intimate night scene, warm ember light, textual beauty.
-->

Dingoes don't have friends. They have pack-mates, rivals, prey, and teachers. But Pokero had made himself vulnerable by explaining his own culture, his own flow state, to a creature who had every reason to misunderstand it.

Pokero,s voice dropped into that hip-hop cadence, each syllable a little knife:

> *Wombat feet.*
> *Masked with clay. All day. Pewtrid*
> *Noses do not lie.*

I felt my ears go flat. The insult landed—not just the words, but the rhythm, the precision. Three syllables like a jab, seven like a hook, five like a body shot.

I thought for three slow breaths. The fire crackled. Somewhere in the dark, a night-bird screamed.

> *Dingo dreams.*
> *What Red Rider? What sharp teeth?*
> *Hood up. Wolf down. Shanked*

Pokero's ears swiveled forward. One heartbeat. Two. Then he bark-laughed—loud enough to spook something in the scrub, loud enough that I knew I'd won the round.

"Not bad, digger," he said. "Not bad at all."

But he wasn't done. Pokero stretched his legs out, crossed his paws, and grinned with all his teeth.

> *Chew on this.*
> *Tasty wombats I have had.*
> *Count your friends. Zero.*

The fire popped. I stared at him. I was the weirdo in Lambda class, the one who dug holes when he was nervous and talked to soil. Pokero knew exactly where to put the blade.

I felt my throat tighten, then remembered: this was a battle of composure. I let the silence stretch. Three seconds. Four. Then:

> *Choke it down.*
> *Wombat penis fills your throat.*
> *Swallow good doggie.*

Pokero froze. His ears went flat, then forward, then flat again. For one terrible moment I thought I'd gone too far—crossed some line where the game became war. Then he threw his head back and howled—actually howled, a long note that carried across the dry plains and probably woke every creature within three klicks.

"Okay," he said when he got his breath back. "Okay. You got me. You actually got me."

He then turned solem, face unsteadingly calm and delivered the knockout.

> *Fat paws dead.*
> *Blinded by the hollow root.*
> *Graveyard for a home.*

I turned it over for a few minutes. Paced the scrub. Felt the shape of the insult, the accuracy of it, the way a good diagnosis hurts because it's true. Then I gave him my answer:

> *Shun the light*
> *Reaping where dingoes are blind.*
> *Shadows hold our lives.*

He didn't say anything for a long time. The embers shifted. A night-bird called from somewhere that wasn't on any map. Then: "Not bad, for a digger."

That was the highest compliment a Dingo gives. We had many more jousts over shooting stars and dying embers. Me, a wombat perfecting dingo speak, the private communication, fifteen syllables each, passed across the species line like a secret handshake made of breath. Two creatures who had no business understanding each other, proving they did.


### The Warning

Close-up of the lead Lost Dingo Scavenger - scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. Lean, rib-thin, desperation in his golden eyes. He's three meters from Hoebat, close enough to smell his breath (rot and hunger), frozen mid-lunge by the Watcher's Frequency. Rain drips from his matted fur. The alley behind him is dark, wet concrete, trash. He sees prey - soft flesh, easy calories, Queensborow smell of soap and safety. But the Code has triggered something older than hunger in him. Style: predator portrait, threat moment, rain effects, urban decay, character detail.

Lolaboo presses against his flank, terrified. The Lost Dingoes freeze mid-circle, ears swiveling. The Code hits them like a physical thing. Style: defensive stance, moment of power, sound visualization, tension, rain-soaked heroism.
-->

I drop my centre of gravity. Find purchase on wet concrete. Square my shoulders. Symmetry. Section 8.2. The posture that says: *I am load-bearing. I am not moving. You cannot push me, pull me, make me yield.*

From my throat, I make a sound.

*Click-clack, hiss, pause.*

Then the words. Dingo-Tongue. Harsh vowels scraping my throat like gravel being swallowed:

*"Bone is dry. Marrow gone. Seek the Dying. Hunt not the Living."*

The Scavenger freezes. Three meters away. Close enough to smell his breath — rot and desperation.

He knows the Code. He knows the law that says *Friend of the Pack*. But he also knows hunger, and in wombat territory, the law barely holds. He hesitates, the ancient covenant warring with the immediate need to eat.

Recognition. Fear. Not of me. But of the choice he has to make.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: Pokero in the Firelight
Pokero the Dingo stepping into the firelight from deeper darkness. Larger than the Scavengers, composed, not hungry but *present*. His golden eyes catch the light - patient as held breath. Country dust washed off, replaced by Melborow grime, but the eyes are the same. He looks at Hoebat with recognition, at Lolaboo with assessment. The Lost Dingoes scatter around him like smoke. One sharp yelp - command, dismissal. The alley is wet concrete, trash-fire glow, rain. Pokero stands in a puddle reflecting firelight. Style: dramatic entrance, predator authority, fire-lit scene, rain effects, character reunion.
-->

A new presence, still indistinct in the rain-slicked gloom, altered the balance. The air itself seemed to sharpen, carrying the faint, wild scent of an larger, more cunning predator.

Pokero steps into the firelight.

He looks different in the city. Harder. Sharper. But the eyes — golden, patient as held breath — those are the same eyes that watched me fumble Dingo vowels by the campfire. 

He doesn't bark. Doesn't growl. One sharp yelp. Command. Dismissal.

The Scavengers scatter.

"You always did have a big mouth, Hoebat," Pokero says. His voice is smoke and gravel. "I heard you halfway from the surface. Does a digger have a death wish, or did you know I get here in save your bacon?"

"Looking for a home. Thought the Council sold honest burrows."

"The Council sells lies with good lighting." He glances at Lolaboo. "Same difference. Both of you smell like natives from Queensborow."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 17: The Wall
The Wall - Trum-Bat's endless concrete ribbon bisecting the horizon like a scar the city gave itself on purpose. It rises above the Gray Grotto, separating the Dead Zones from the "developed" areas. Pokero stands before it, looking up, knowing it won't stop what's coming - walls just make abandonment fester, trap it inside with the living. The Wall is gray, brutal, geometric. Behind it, the glow of Queensborow. Before it, the darkness of the Grotto. Rain falls on concrete. Style: brutalist architecture, social division, rain-slicked concrete, character dwarfed by structure, dystopian urban planning.
-->

He turns, and his gaze falls on the half-finished skeleton of the Wall rising in the distance, a silhouette of concrete against a sky the colour of a bruise.

"I've seen the schematics, Hoebat," he says, his voice a low rumble that barely carries over the rain. "I've sat in the meetings. Listened to Trum-Bat sell it to the delegation." He lets out a short, humourless laugh. "He calls it 'civic armature.' Says it will protect you."

He looks back at me, his golden eyes burning in the gloom. "That Wall isn't for keeping things out. It's for keeping you *in*. It's a lid for a coffin."

"I'm not buying in the Grotto," I say, my own voice sounding hollow.

"Good," he snaps, the sound sharp as cracking bone. "This place is Dead Tissue. Section 3.1, if you're keeping score. The spirit's already left the body. My kind are just the maggots. We hunt here because there's nothing left to damage."

He steps closer, invading my space, until I can smell the wild, ungroomed scent of him—the smell of territories that don't appear on maps, of a creature who still belongs to the earth. He glances at Lolaboo, a flicker of assessment, then fixes his gaze on me.

"Keep her close. The Council's 'perimeter redistribution' is just a pretty name for flushing the unwanted. The Soft-Paws who wander alone don't wander long."

His voice drops to a whisper, urgent and conspiratorial. This isn't a friend giving advice. This is an operative passing a critical directive. "If you want a hole that won't cave in," he breathes, the words meant only for me, "you listen to the intelligence, not the marketing."

> *Shun the rot*
> *Seek not where dingoes do hunt.*
> *Your walls hold your dead*

Then he's gone. A ghost melting back into the rain. A shadow slipping back into the Council chambers where he never belonged.

Part of me is furious. The anger is a hot, solid knot in my gut. *Years, Pokero. Not a word.* I wanted to grab him by the scruff, to demand an explanation for the silence. But the part of me that felt the Scavenger's hunger in the air knows we'd be dead without him. The anger and the gratitude mix like oil and water, leaving a bitter taste in the back of my throat.
The lights flicker back on. Sickly yellow. The Frequency returns — that electronic hum telling us everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations crumbling.

Lolaboo's app reboots. Cheerful chime. Seventy meters to property. Great investment opportunity.

"How did you do that?" she breathes.

"The Council thinks the world is math," I say, my voice flat. "The Dingos know better. The world is a song. And when you get the rhythm wrong," I glance toward the storm drain the Scavengers came from, "it eats you."

"We aren't buying here, Lolaboo."

"But the listing—the app said—"

"The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies," I spit, already walking, my paws splashing through stagnant puddles.

Lolaboo follows.

-->

The realisation comes in the rain. These things always do.

I'm standing in the Gray Grotto. Years after that first night with Lolaboo, years after the Root Chamber, years after the exile. The streetlights are still smashed. The Dead Zone has spread — more tunnels abandoned, more neglect, more temporal cropping as the Council pulls resources back to the centre, hollowing out the periphery to feed the core, which is what empires do when they're dying: they eat their own edges.

I'm thinking about Pokero's words. *Look where the Dingoes don't hunt.*

I've been carrying those words for years. Not in my mind — in my body. The way you carry a stone in your pocket until the pocket takes the shape of the stone and the stone takes the warmth of your leg and eventually you forget which is stone and which is flesh. Pokero's words have lived in me like that. A physical weight. An unresolved mass.

<!--

Words cross out, subtract, reveal the hidden message: "Light are blind, shadows hold truth." The rain continues to fall. The alley is dark. Years of carrying the weight in his body, waiting for the clay to cure, the bond to set. Pokero's game, played across time and distance. Style: typographic revelation, puzzle solving, rain atmosphere, textual art, moment of clarity.
-->

And then — standing in the rain, in the dark, with clay still under my claws from the night's repairs — I think of the campfire. The Haiku game. Our private verses. The ones nobody else ever heard.

Pokero's move:

> *Fat paws press dead ground,*
> *Blind roots choke on their own depth,*
> *Stones that call it home.*

My counter:

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

Two haikus. Two creatures. A conversation compressed into thirty-four syllables that only we could read.

And suddenly his parting words in the Grotto — *look where the Dingoes don't hunt* — aren't just advice. They're a move. He's playing the game. After all these years, across all this distance, he reached back to those campfire nights and made a move.

My mind works slowly, methodically, the way it works when I'm packing clay into a fracture. Not rushing. Not leaping. Feeling the shape of the gap before filling it. Crossing out words. Subtracting Pokero's parting phrase from my own haiku the way you subtract the mould from the casting, the negative from the positive, the silence from the sound.

*Look, where, the, dingoes, do, not, hunt.*

Remove those syllables from my verse. What remains?

What remains is what was always there, hiding in the negative space the way a fossil hides in rock — not added but revealed, not created but uncovered, waiting for the right erosion:

> **"Light are blind, shadows hold truth."**

Not just directions. A diagnosis.

*The Council — the Light — is blind to the reality of the collapse. The truth of the world is hiding in the shadows, and we must go there to protect it.*

The Click.

I feel it in my chest. Not my mind — my chest. The sternum. The deep bone where a wombat's centre of gravity lives, the architectural keystone of our body, the bone that holds the weight of the shoulders and transfers it downward into the legs and through the paws into the earth. The Click happens there — a vibration, a resonance, the mechanical shifting of understanding into place. Like a key turning. Like a joint settling. Like the moment when fresh clay bonds with living soil and you feel the fracture close and the weight redistribute and the tunnel — for now, for this moment — decides to hold.

Pokero was playing the game. He made his move years ago in that alley, dropped his fifteen syllables into the rain, and walked away. And I — slow, methodical, a wombat to the marrow — have been carrying those syllables in my body ever since, waiting for the clay to cure, waiting for the bond to set, waiting for the patient chemistry of understanding to complete its work.

The deepest knowing isn't intellectual. It's geological. It happens at the speed of rock. It happens in the body, in the bones, in the paws pressed flat against cold earth. You don't think your way to truth. You weather your way there. You stand in the rain long enough and the rain, through sheer persistence, teaches you the shape of your own face.

The root network pulses with violet life. Style: dawn light, connection across distance, sound visualization, hope renewed, network coming alive.

Far away — I feel it rather than know it — something answers. A vibration in the root-network. A frequency shift. Somewhere in the Violet Zone, where the Jacaranda's shallow roots spread wide across the surface, Cooroo picks up the signal. The Galah — that loud, pink, stubbornly purposeless bird — screams a check into the dawn. The echo returns changed.

The Mind of the Squad is awake.

The signal confirms what the bones already know. The Kappa Mu is active. The cipher that Pokero planted in the rain — hidden inside a private game that only two creatures in the world knew how to play — has germinated in the dark of my ribcage, and the root it sends out connects to every other member through the network of shallow roots that the Jacaranda taught us to trust.

I know where to go now. I understand the mission.

Not to save the Centre. The Centre is calcified, lost, addicted to its own Frequency. You can't save something that has mistaken its sickness for health, its numbness for comfort, its crystallisation for stability.

To work in the shadows. To hold the edges. To find the places where the Dingoes don't hunt — the places where the spirit hasn't left, where the soil still breathes, where the **Geometry** hasn't completely won. To be the Living Root, not the Dead Branch.

Some arrive at this understanding through the body. Through exile. Through the long, slow education of standing in a place until the place enters you and you enter it and the distinction between observer and landscape ceases to matter. Some arrive at it through the twist — the sudden inversion where the mundane reveals the miraculous, where the kid pulling a funny face in the mirror discovers the mirror has been watching back the whole time.

I arrive at it through clay. Through paws. Through thirty years of pressing my hands against the earth and listening to what it says.

IMAGE PROMPT 25: Into the Dark
Hoebat walking into the dark tunnel, trowel in paw, vest adjusted. Toward the next fracture, the next place that needs holding. The work never ends, the weight never lightens, but he is a wombat, and wombats endure. Behind him, the faint light of the Gray Grotto. Before him, darkness total. His posture is load-bearing, symmetrical, stubborn. He is the Living Root, not the Dead Branch. The tunnel accepts him. Style: solitary heroism, walking into darkness, endurance, determination, atmospheric perspective.

I pick up my trowel. Adjust my vest. Walk into the dark, toward the next fracture, toward the next place that needs holding.

The work never ends. The weight never lightens.

But I am a wombat. And wombats endure.
