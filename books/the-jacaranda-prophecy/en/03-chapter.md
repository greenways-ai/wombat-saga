The Emu Steppe isn't a place you choose to land. It's a place you end up when better options have expired.

I hit the ground with all the elegance of a pink rock, the Morning Glory vine cushioning my impact slightly before being squashed beneath me. For a moment, I just lay there, contemplating the many ways in which prophecy was overrated. The sky was doing that thing where it curves up in every direction, the inner surface of Hún Nico wrapping around me like a bowl, and I was the pathetic little piece of debris at the bottom.

My wings were done. Finished. The juvenile feathers were frayed, the muscles spasming, the joints screaming in protest. I couldn't fly anymore. I could barely walk. I was a flightless bird in a world designed for fliers, carrying a dying plant to a tree I couldn't reach.

The Wedgies emerged from the Gorge. Three black shapes, no longer in perfect formation — I'd managed to disrupt their geometry, which I would have found satisfying if I wasn't about to be disassembled. They circled above, re-establishing their calculations, preparing for the final approach.

I stood up, wobbling, positioned myself between the Wedgies and the vine. It was a stupid gesture — the vine was a plant, it didn't need protection, and my body certainly couldn't provide any — but it felt important.

The lead Eagle — I could tell it was the lead because it was slightly more geometric than the others — adjusted its wings and began the final descent.

Then the ground moved.

Then the ground moved under the tread of an Emu.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Spiral Run Begins
The ground moving - not earthquake, but an Emu. Two meters of feathered dinosaur with no fear, armored scaled legs, sickle claws, dried-blood eyes. The Emu is running in a spiral pattern - a vast, looping, non-repeating trajectory. Each footfall lands where geometry says it shouldn't, generating pure chaos. The Wedgies scatter in panic above. Style: dynamic action, spiral motion blur, sudden intervention, powerful creature, kinetic chaos visualized.
-->

If you've never seen an Emu up close, congratulations on your sensible life choices. They are enormous — two metres of bird that evolution designed by asking "what if a feathered dinosaur had no fear and even less patience?" Their legs are armored, scaled, built for running distances that would kill lesser creatures. Their claws are sickles, curved and sharp and designed to disembowel. Their eyes are the colour of dried blood and they look at you with an expression that says "I am considering whether you are worth the effort of killing."

This one ran in a spiral, a vast, looping, non-repeating pattern that carved a groove in the Steppe grass and shredded the air currents with its passage.

The Emu's feet struck the earth in rhythms that made no sense — left, then right, then somehow both and neither — each step landing where geometry said it shouldn't, where prediction failed, where the neat lines of probability frayed into chaos. The air around it curdled, churned, tearing itself apart in the wake of that impossible gait. What had been Glass-Air — smooth, tiled, predictable — became Raca (Broken Air), became brokenness, became the kind of turbulence that laughed at vectors and mocked trajectories. The Wedgies' perfect mathematics crumbled before it.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Walker and the Wedgies
The Emu standing absolutely still after its spiral run - one second a blur of motion, the next absolute coiled potential. The three Wedgies circle helplessly at the edge of visibility, unable to approach the Spiral Zone. The Emu's dried-blood eyes track them without fear. Cooroo is a small pink shape huddled nearby. Style: standoff, tense stillness after motion, predator intimidation, atmospheric disturbance.
-->

The Wedgies broke. Immediately. No calculation, no geometric adjustment — just pure, panicked evasion as the Emu's wake turbulence tore their formation apart.

The spiral tightened. The Emu wasn't just running; it was weaving chaos itself into the air, each impossible step churning the atmosphere into Raca (Broken Air). The Wedgies' Vector Sight couldn't penetrate it. You can't calculate the trajectory of Raca. The Spiral Zone was pure unpredictability, and the Wedgies kept their distance from it, circling at the edge like dogs afraid of fire.

I watched, beak open, vine forgotten, as this impossible bird disrupted the sky through sheer aggressive movement. The Emu was grey-brown, the colour of the Steppe itself, and its feathers — coarse, lacquered, evolution's answer to body armor — caught the light in a way that made it shimmer, made it hard to track, made it impossible to predict.

The Wedgies regrouped at a distance, circling, unwilling to approach. The Emu slowed, stopped — one second it was a blur of motion, the next it was absolutely still, coiled potential, a spring that had decided to wait.

It turned its head and looked at me.

Looked at the vine.

Looked at the Wedgies, circling helplessly above, unable to approach.

I don't care. But decide." Style: intimate moment between species, unprecedented connection, dramatic lighting.
-->

Then it lowered its massive, armored neck — a gesture I had never seen in any natural history text, any field guide, any story told by any bird in any colony. The neck came down to my level, the great head with its dried-blood eyes regarding me with an expression I couldn't read.

"You're... offering me a ride?"

The Emu said nothing. Emus don't say things. They exist at a volume that makes speech redundant. The posture was clear: *Get on. Or don't. I don't care. But decide, because I have spirals to run.*

"That's not... that's not a thing. Emus don't give rides. That's a fundamental... there's a Code. The Walker's Code. Emus are solitary. They don't carry passengers. It's a violation of..."

The Emu shifted its weight. One massive foot lifted, came down. The ground vibrated. The message, if possible, became clearer: *Get on or get eaten by Wedgies. I have no preference. But the window for decision-making is closing.*

I looked at the Wedgies. They were regrouping, recalculating, finding new vectors. They wouldn't stay scared forever.

I looked at the vine. It was humming again, responding to the Emu's chaos, finding resonance in the turbulent wake of that impossible gait.

I got on.

### The Apostate

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: Riding the Spiral
Cooroo clinging to the Emu's back as they move at sixty kilometers per hour across the Steppe. The Galah is essentially a pink hat with opinions - claws dug into coarse lacquered feathers, body bouncing with each footfall. The landscape blurs - grassland, scrub, occasional stone outcroppings. The vine revives in the chaos. Style: high-speed motion, blurred background, clinging for dear life, chaotic energy.
-->

Here's what they teach you in Galah school about Emus: nothing.

Absolutely nothing, because Galahs don't have school and even if we did, Emus wouldn't be on the curriculum. They exist in a separate category — the Walkers of the Southern Steppe, the creatures who patrol the land and others do the explaining for them. You don't learn about Emus. You stay out of their way and hope they've decided you're not worth killing today.

Riding one is not a thing.

It's like... okay. Imagine you're a small, loud, mostly useless creature — which, if you're a Galah, you don't have to imagine — and suddenly you're on the back of a feathered tank that's moving at sixty kilometres per hour across terrain that technically counts as "ground" only in the loosest sense. The Emu's feathers — coarse, lacquered, each one the size of my wing — chafed against my claws. Its back was too wide for a proper grip and too narrow for stability. I was essentially a pink hat that had opinions about theology.

I dug my claws in and tried not to scream. The Emu launched.

We moved in swerves and loops, the Emu refusing any linear path. The world blurred into streaks of grey-brown and green. My claws dug deeper, holding on as the ground beneath us seemed to tilt and roll like the surface of a storm-tossed sea. The air thickened, churned up by our passage, pressing against my feathers with a force that felt almost solid — something alive and electric, something the Wedgies couldn't see through and couldn't calculate.

The vine revived. The chaos of the Emu's wake — the non-repeating pattern, the fractal footfalls, the sheer aggressive unpredictability of its gait — woke it up. The lilac hum returned, stronger now, pointed southeast like a compass needle that had found magnetic north.

I risked a look back. The Wedgies were following — of course they were following, they were nothing if not persistent — but they kept their distance. Way back, circling at the edge of visibility, watching but not approaching.

They were afraid. Of the Emu, sure — everyone with sense is afraid of Emus — but also of what we represented. The Walker had a rider. In the history of the Southern Shell, in all the scrolls and songs and silent traditions that the Emus maintained without ever writing down, no Emu had ever allowed a rider.

I saw one of the Wedgies break formation, angle its wings toward the upper atmosphere. Signaling — not to the others, but up, toward the Lusta Ómëa where the big birds lived. The message was clear enough even for me to read: *"The Walker has a rider. Just wait until the Shogun hears about this."*

I didn't know who the Shogun was. I had a feeling I would find out.

But for now, we ran.

The Emu didn't acknowledge me. Not once. It ran as if I wasn't there, as if my weight was irrelevant, as if carrying a juvenile bird and a foreign vine across contested territory was just another Tuesday in a life spent refusing to explain itself.

We passed through regions I didn't have names for. The Steppe gave way to scrubland. Then to something that stopped me.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Old Stumps
From the Emu's back, Cooroo looking out across a section of scrubland where enormous crystallised stumps are visible - trees that fell long ago, now hexagonal monuments to what they were. They're old: the stumps aren't warm anymore, they've tiled fully, each one a column of perfect geometry where a living thing used to be. There are dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. The Steppe grass grows between them. Some are barely visible. Style: desolate, historical, the past made visible in geology.
-->

The Steppe opened out and I saw them for the first time from the right height.

Stumps. Old ones. Dozens of them — maybe more, stretching out across a broad slope where the grass grew spare and the soil was a particular thin grey. They weren't like the Silver Wattle's stump, still warm, still humming its dead note. These were old. Finished. Each one a perfect hexagonal column, fully tiled, the Static having completed its work years or generations ago. Some were barely visible under the grass, just a geometric sheen at ground level, a faint wrongness in the way the light caught the surface.

I'd known the Silver Wattle wasn't the first. I'd heard the names — the Great Wattle at the Crown, the Black Wattle, the Golden Wattle — heard them the way you hear old names, as history, as past. Standing on the Eastern Ridge, the Silver Wattle had still been there. The others were somewhere else, someplace gone. Abstract.

From the Emu's back, looking out across this slope, they weren't abstract anymore.

There had been trees here. This had been a forest, once. And the forest had reached down, the way forests do, the way trees do — faithful to their nature, drilling toward the source — and the source had been waiting.

I thought about what Mum used to say when the bark started cracking in hexagonal lines: *"The return is changing."* Not: *the tree is dying.* Not: *the wombats did it,* though they did too, in their way, trying to help and severing the very things that held it together. Just: the return is changing. As if she already knew that what the tree found when it reached deepest was not what it used to find there.

Every stump I could see had been a tree that drank from the same poisoned source.

The Emu ran through them without slowing. Its feet knew where to land. It had been running this Steppe its whole life. It had watched the stumps appear, one by one, over years. It hadn't explained this to me. It was simply here, running its spirals through a field of what used to be a forest, making the air impossible to calculate, refusing to stop.

The vine hummed in my claws, southeast, southeast, and I held on.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Purple in the Landscape

-->

The landscape changed colour. The grey-brown of the Steppe shifted, became tinged with something. I squinted against the wind. Purple? The air was carrying moisture from somewhere alive, somewhere that shouldn't exist.

The Emu slowed to a canter, then a trot, the spiral tightening as we approached something.

I looked ahead. The ground rose in a gentle slope, covered in vegetation that shouldn't exist — broad-leafed plants, flowering things, greenery that drank deep and grew tall. And at the top of the slope, visible now, impossible now:

A wall of violet.

The Emu stopped. One final footfall, and then stillness — absolute, coiled, dangerous stillness. It lowered its neck, and I understood: this was my stop. The end of the line. The Emu had carried me as far as it would go, and now I had to walk the rest of the way alone.

I slid off. My claws touched grass — actual grass, soft and alive and nothing like the crystallized wasteland I'd left behind. I stumbled, caught myself, turned to thank the Emu.

It was already walking away.

"Wait — I didn't even — you didn't even tell me your —"

It didn't turn. Didn't pause. Just kept moving in that ground-eating stride, back toward the Steppe, back to its spirals, back to a life that had briefly intersected with mine and was now resuming its refusal to connect.

I called after it: "I'm going to remember this! When I tell the story, you're going to be in it! A hero! An Emu who —"

The Emu broke into a run, abandoning the conversation for the solitude of the Steppe. I watched it go, diminishing into the grassland, until it was just a dot, then a memory, then the kind of thing you'd doubt if someone told you about it secondhand.

I turned around.

The Jacaranda filled the world.

### The Violet Zone

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT: The Jacaranda Clearing

The Jacaranda's roots - shallow, wide, fractal - break the lattice, create defects. Style: lush paradise, magical clearing, life vs crystal at edges, vibrant colors, sense of sanctuary.
-->

It was enormous. Ancient. Its trunk was wider than the Silver Wattle had been — wider than any tree I'd ever seen. And it was covered in flowers. Not just covered — consumed. Cascades of violet blooms poured from every branch, spilling down in waterfalls of colour that caught Elen-Nico's light and held it, transformed it, sent it back into the world as something that wasn't gold and wasn't ember.

The pause between beats, made permanent. The concentrated sky, made wood.

The clearing around the tree was alive. Grass grew thick and soft. Flowers dotted the ground in colours I'd forgotten existed — yellow, white, the occasional brave red. The air was thick with scent, with moisture, with the weight of living things.

But the crystal was still here. I could see it at the edges of the clearing — hexagonal formations pushing upward like frost through soil, geometric intrusions that had tried to tile and failed. Stopped. Blocked. The tree's roots — shallow, wide, spreading sideways in patterns that never repeated — broke the lattice, created defects, made the ground too rough for perfect tiling. The Static was still trying. It just wasn't winning here.

I thought of the stumps I'd just passed. All those trees that had drilled down, faithful to their nature, reaching for the source. This tree's roots floated at the surface, touching everything lightly, going nowhere deep. Not what the old trees did. Something different.

I walked forward. My claws sank into soil that was soft, loamy, alive. The vine in my grip hummed, and the hum was different now — not the desperate pull of a compass needle but something that had found where it was pointing.

I reached the trunk. The bark was smooth, grey-brown, foreign. Nothing like the Silver Wattle's rough gold. I raised the Morning Glory vine — wilted now, barely alive, but the root ball was intact, still carrying whatever it had been carrying all this way — and pressed it against the bark.

The contact was electric. Not painful, but intense, like touching something that was more real than the surrounding reality.

I stood there and held on.

<!--

-->

The vine's frequency and the tree's frequency found each other. I felt it in my feathers before I felt it anywhere else — that specific hum of two things that have been separated recognising each other across a distance I couldn't measure. Not painful. Not even dramatic. Like a door that had been stuck finally closing flush.

Then my feathers received something.

Not words. Not images. Not what I'd call a vision — or if it was a vision, it was one I couldn't look at directly. It arrived the way very cold water arrives when you first step in: total, immediate, impossible to summarise. The Silver Wattle's two hundred years of accumulated signal moving through the vine, through my grip, through the bark, into the tree. And something else moving back. Something the tree had been holding that was neither gold nor the deep poison, something that had been working its own logic in the Lone Borow territory for longer than anyone had been keeping track.

The Jacaranda's branches swayed. There was no wind.

The violet blooms deepened, as if the colour was receiving something it had been incomplete without.

I stood there until the hum settled. Then I let go.

I walked backwards a few steps. Sat down on the grass. My claws sank in.

I didn't know what had happened. That's the honest version. I knew it had happened. My feathers knew. The chambers in my skull were still reverberating, still carrying the after-shape of frequencies I had no names for. Something had passed between the vine and the tree, and in passing had also passed through me, and now it was in my bones the way the Bad Grounds was in my bones — a thing I could feel without being able to explain.

<!--

Style: impressionistic, light and shadow, something felt rather than seen.
-->

There had been something in that exchange. Not information — or not information the way a frequency check is information, not data I could repeat back. More like a quality of attention. A shift in what I was pointing at.

The clearing was very quiet. The Wedgies were out there somewhere, circling. I could feel them not approaching, the same way you can feel a tooth that hasn't started hurting yet.

But my feathers — my feathers were still pointing south-east.

The vine's signal had stopped. There was nothing in my feathers giving me coordinates, no hum pulling at my sternum. Just the ordinary fact that when I faced south-east, the world felt less wrong than when I faced any other direction. Not better. Less wrong. Like having one end of a rope and knowing the other end is attached to something, somewhere, even though you can't see what.

The tree had given me something. A direction, maybe. Or something less than a direction — more like the knowledge that south-east was not finished. That this clearing was not the last stop.

I didn't know what that meant.

I was also extremely tired.

<!--

-->

The grass was soft. The air smelled of violet and something green and alive that I didn't have a word for. Above me, the Jacaranda did what it had been doing before I arrived and would keep doing after I left: it bloomed, and broke the lattice, and held the dirt together.

It was not thinking about me.

I closed my eyes.

South-east. Whatever that meant. Whatever was there.

Tomorrow. Or the day after. Whenever my wings worked again.

I slept.
