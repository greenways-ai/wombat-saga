### The Ceremony

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Ceremony
The entrance to a Sector 7 ceremony hall — Grout-sealed, formula-straight, officially lit. Hoebat standing in the corridor outside, refused entry. Through the open doorway: the backs of the families inside, the ceremony in progress. A Council Compliance Officer at the door. Visible through the frame: Morillaboo sitting with one paw pressed flat to the floor, her head turned slightly — the moment she sees Hoebat in the doorway and then looks away. In the background, moving boxes visible beside Pellaboo's family. Style: exclusion, grief, institutional space containing something it wasn't designed for, the specific damage of a look that doesn't complete itself.
-->

The ceremony was held in a Council hall in Sector 7. Grout-sealed walls, formula-straight bores, regulated light. The kind of space that announces by its architecture what kind of grief it will permit.

I arrived at the start of the third mourning period. A Council Compliance Officer was standing outside the door.

"Hoebat," she said. Not a question — a categorization.

"Yes."

"You're not permitted to enter."

She had a list. My name was on it with a notation I didn't get close enough to read. I stood in the corridor and she stood in the doorway, and behind her I could see the backs of everyone who was allowed to be there.

Tallibat's father was in the front row. A broad-backed wombat, the paw-calluses of a Safety Grout inspector visible from where I stood. His shoulders were squared forward — the posture of someone who has been given the correct understanding of what happened to his son and is holding it with both paws because the alternative is nothing. His wife sat beside him, very still. She did not turn.

Barnabat was there with his father.

His father sat two rows behind Tallibat's family, upright, present, performing grief correctly, the way you perform everything correctly when your name is the credential. Barnabat sat beside him. I could see the side of his face. He was looking straight ahead at the ceremony. He did not turn toward the doorway. He did not turn at all.

He knew I was there. He has always had that quality — the specific awareness of where everyone in a space is positioned, the feel for who is watching whom. He knew I was in the doorway. He kept his eyes on the ceremony and did not look.

His father, who had also been watching the ceremony, glanced once toward the door with the calm of someone who is keeping account of a situation and considers it accounted for. He looked at me — not the administrative look from the corridor, something slightly different. Something that had already moved past the decision to the place beyond it. Then back to the ceremony.

Pellaboo's family was near the back.

Morillaboo was sitting with one paw in her lap and one paw pressed flat to the floor. Even here, in a Grout-sealed Council hall with formula-straight walls and regulated light, she was pressing her paw to the earth. I had watched her do it her whole life — in the workshop, in the Groves, in Pellaboo's kitchen where the clay-pressed bread cooled on the shelf. The earth didn't change for an official ceremony. She was still listening.

She looked up once.

She saw me in the doorway.

For a moment she was completely still — not the stillness of someone who hasn't seen you, but the stillness of someone who has seen you and is deciding what they're able to do. Her face held everything at once: she knew, and she couldn't say so, and she couldn't look away, and she couldn't help.

She looked away.

The Council official shifted slightly to block more of my sightline. I didn't move.

I heard afterward — from another Groves family, not from anyone at the ceremony — that Pellaboo's family had been notified two days before the funeral. Unregistered, the Council said. Thirty days to relocate to assigned grid housing in Sector 11. Their current address would be cleared for reassessment.

Sector 11 was three grid-sectors from the Groves. No margin access. No surface-access ladder. No kiln, no pre-formation clay, no workshop. The singing bowls — the shelves of them, the ones Tallibat had struck for two hours the afternoon he changed, the ones Pellaboo had learned to shape kneeling beside her mother since before she could hold a striker — those would not transfer. Assigned grid housing in Sector 11 had no place for a kiln that predated the grid's light infrastructure. The Council did not need to say *and this is part of the price.* The address was the price.

I stood in the corridor for the full length of the ceremony. When it ended, the families filed out past me and I watched each face make the same calculation: seeing me, knowing, looking ahead and continuing. Not hate. Not accusation. The specific expression of people who understand that the Tally is the only protection they have left and looking at me would cost something they cannot afford.

Tallibat's father passed closest. The corridor was narrow and he had to move around me slightly. In that moment, close enough that I could see the tool-calluses on his digging hand, he looked at a point on the wall slightly above my right shoulder. Maintained it for the three seconds it took to pass.

He knew. He didn't know what to do with what he knew, and the Council had ensured there was nothing to do with it.

Morillaboo came last. She was carrying a cloth bag — the kind you use for moving things that can't be boxed. She stopped in front of me.

She stood there for four or five seconds. Long enough that the Compliance Officer took a step forward.

Morillaboo looked at my paws. Not my face. My paws — still clay-marked from the tunnel, from the fourteen minutes of digging Barnabat clear. She looked at them the way she looked at a bowl before she struck it: reading what was there.

Then she walked past me down the corridor, and I didn't see her again for a very long time.

I went home.

### The Crack That Heals

I came home after the ceremony. Neither Cornelibat nor Agathaboo had slept — the burrow had the particular quality of two wombats who have been awake for hours pretending otherwise, both listening to the other pretend, neither pretending well enough.

I thought he might not have a story for this. In my entire childhood, through scraped knees and broken things and every injustice childhood manufactures in quantity, Cornelibat had always found a story. But I had never been expelled before. I had never had two names and a charge on my record. I thought perhaps this was the thing that was too large for stories — that we'd have to just sit with it, which I had no idea how to do.

At dawn, he made tea and sat at the burrow entrance watching the eucalyptus. After a long while he said: "Come here, Hoebat. Sit. The eucalyptus is showing its silver undersides — wind's changing."

I sat. I didn't want to sit. I wanted to dig until I reached something that made sense.

"There is a type of crack," he said, looking at the trees.

He didn't look at me. He almost never did.

"The kind that runs with the grain of the material. Following the direction the earth naturally wants to move. When you find one, it looks like failure — an inspector reaches for the Grout immediately, because looking bad and being bad are the same thing in an inspector's report. But what it actually is: the earth healing. The material returning to where it wants to be. Leave it alone and it seals itself."

He drank his tea.

"And there is the other kind. Against-grain. Different geometry, different direction. Those are the ones that need your hands on them."

He put the cup down.

"A grain-running crack sealed with Grout: the earth can no longer do what it was doing. Six years, eight years, the stress that crack was releasing has nowhere to go." A pause exactly long enough to matter. "The tunnel fails. And the Grout-inspector's report says: see, the crack was the problem. We sealed it. Something else must have failed."

He turned and looked at me for the first time that morning.

"The crack was the solution."

Silence. The eucalyptus moved. First light.

"Keep your head down," he said.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Third Story
Dawn in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat at the entrance with his tea, watching the eucalyptus. Hoebat behind him, not yet sat down — still standing, the night's weight on him. The story begins. In the air between them, the crack: grain-running, healing, the specific geometry of earth doing its own repair. And next to it, the Grout seal placed over it — clean, official, white. Covering the thing that was fixing itself. Style: dawn light, father and son, the story as the last bridge between them.

### The Hypocrite

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: The Argument
The argument in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat still at the entrance, not turning around. Hoebat standing behind him — fifteen years old, charged, expelled, and now being told to be quiet by the person who taught him the earth was worth listening to. The specific violence of a story used to justify its opposite. The burrow that used to be warm, now just a space where two correct things are incompatible. Style: domestic confrontation, father and son, the wrong kind of quiet, the gap between a principle and its application.
-->

I stared at the back of his head for a long moment.

"You just told me," I said, "that the tunnel failed because someone sealed the thing that was healing it."

He said nothing.

"You told me the inspector sealed the crack because it looked bad. And the sealing was what killed the tunnel. Not the crack."

He was very still.

"And now you're telling me to be the Grout."

"That's not what I said."

"It's exactly what you said. Keep your head down. Don't make noise. Don't be the thing that looks bad, even if the thing that looks bad is the thing that's healing." My voice came out calmer than what was happening in my chest. Something had gone cold there — the specific cold of earth far below the thermal layer, the kind that doesn't fluctuate. "The Council sealed you. You lost your certification, your guild, twenty years of your career. You ended up in the Groves in unregistered clay because they put Grout over a grain-running crack and called it fixed. And now the crack is standing in your burrow at dawn telling you what happened to it — and you're telling me to *comply.*"

"You are fifteen years old."

"I know how old I am."

"You don't know what this costs." He turned — and his face had the expression of a wombat who has survived something and the survival was not a victory, just a continuing. "I know what the record does to you. I know every room it closes. I know what a number like that does to a life. I know, because I am living it — and if you think this burrow in unnotched territory with no grid access and no certification is what I planned for my life, then you do not understand what they took." His voice stayed completely level. The level you reach not through calm but through having been through the thing so many times that it no longer spikes. "I am not telling you to stop believing what you believe. I am telling you that they will take everything if you give them a reason."

"They already took everything," I said. "Tallibat is dead. Pellaboo is dead. The crystal bowl she was shaping is buried under thirty tonnes of pre-formation clay. The record says I sent them in there. Barnabat signed his name to that because his father's name is worth more to his family than I am." The cold spreading. "What exactly is there left to protect?"

He didn't answer.

That was the part I couldn't get past. Not the advice. The silence after the advice ran out. The moment when there was nothing left to say because he was right and I was right and both things were true at the same time and he knew it and so did I and neither of us could make them fit together.

"You're a coward," I said.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: Cornelibat's Silence
Cornelibat's face in the moment after Hoebat calls him a coward. He doesn't argue. He doesn't flinch. He looks like a wombat who has just heard an accurate diagnosis and has nowhere to put it. The eucalyptus outside. The burrow that smells of clay and stringybark. Agathaboo visible in the background, still, not intervening. The specific awfulness of a silence that doesn't defend itself. Style: quiet devastation, character portrait, the weight of a word that's true.
-->

I want to be accurate about what I meant. Not an insult. A diagnosis. I was fifteen and I thought naming the correct problem was the same as beginning to solve it. I was wrong about that. I was not wrong about the diagnosis.

He didn't argue. That was the moment — not the charge, not Barnabat, not the High Auditor with his pre-decided stone. The moment I understood there is a kind of damage that goes deep enough it stops defending itself. My father, who had spent my entire childhood filling me with the principle that the earth speaks and the only honest work is listening — he looked at me calling him a coward and he had nothing.

Not because it wasn't true. Because it was.

Agathaboo was in the back of the burrow. She'd done the calculation too.

### What Was Buried

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: The Workshop Remains
Hoebat in the hidden workshop below the Academy, alone, gathering what remains. The crystal singing bowl — cracked but not destroyed, the one Pellaboo had nearly finished before the collapse. The signal pot, unfired, waiting. Tallibat's notes, water-stained but legible. Barnabat's ciphered documentation. The evidence of what they'd been trying to build. Hoebat packing these things carefully, not sure why he's taking them, just knowing they can't be left for the Cathedral to classify. Style: aftermath, preservation, the remains of a dream, quiet grief.
-->

I went back to the Academy that night. Not through the entrance — through the maintenance panel in the sub-level corridor, the one I'd used for five months of sessions with the crew. I was expelled. The charge was on my record. But I needed to see what was left.

The workshop was untouched. The Cathedral had taken Barnabat's statement, charged me with the stated cause, and never looked deeper. The story was complete: reckless student, unauthorized excavation, tragic accident. What we'd actually been building didn't fit that story, so what we'd been building had ceased to exist for official purposes.

I gathered what I could carry.

Pellaboo's crystal bowl — the one she'd been shaping toward something she'd called the Wail, cracked in the collapse's aftermath, still holding its form. The unfired signal pot. Tallibat's notes on how the crystal sang in the deep clay, written in his careful formula-trained hand — a Grid-educated wombat spending the last months of his life learning to document something the Grid had no language for. Barnabat's ciphered field book, full of observations about crystal formation and what it did to the sound in the earth around it. Observations better than anything the Academy's courses had produced, from a wombat who chose his family's name over those observations and who was probably right to, and whom I would spend years not hating because hating him would have required believing he'd had a real choice.

I didn't know why I was taking these things. Only that they couldn't stay here. Only that someone had to remember what we'd been trying to build — and for now, I was the one still standing.

I held the bowl for a while in the dark workshop.

Pellaboo had said once, while shaping it: *the crystal wants to go in a direction.* Not explaining — just noting, the way she noted things while her paws were working. I'd assumed she meant the material's response during firing. Now I held the bowl in the dark workshop and thought maybe she'd meant something else.

There had always been stories about the crystals. The kind that circulate at the margins of the commute, passed between kids with two minutes to spare and no reason to invent anything because the real version was strange enough.

*They're growing.* That one had the most versions. Started when the major Grout seals went in sixty years back, accelerating since. Sealed earth can't do what it usually does, so it does something else. Some versions said spreading toward the Academy basement. Some said toward the inhabited sectors. Some said the Cathedral knew and the restriction flags were about the crystals specifically, not the structural grade.

*The bowls push them back.* A newer story, more contested. A maintenance worker who'd run the sub-level before the Dead Zones were reclassified had noticed: growth in the sections nearest the old workshop spaces ran different. Lighter. Where sound had been made regularly — where the old bowls had been used — the crystals were sparse, thin, almost retreating. Where the Grout went in and the sound stopped: they grew dense and branching and blue. The Cathedral had put nothing about this in any public document. The crystals appeared on restricted mapping and nowhere else.

*Something's down there.* I had heard this three times, from three different kids, and all three delivered it the same way — flat, no performance, the specific quality of someone reporting what they saw rather than what they'd decided to believe. Go past the fourth level, past the chamber we'd been working in, and the lamp feels wrong. Not dim — wrong. Like the light arrives slightly after it left. And you feel watched. Not afraid. Just present to something that is present to you.

I had felt it myself. In the fifth month, twenty paces past the limit of where the crew usually worked. I had followed a cold in the walls that didn't match anything they'd mapped, and stopped when the feeling arrived. Not threat. Something attending. I stood with my paws flat on the tunnel floor and felt the earth's attention the way I'd felt it in the Groves as a child — except larger. More deliberate. I went back without saying anything.

We had been close. We had the crystal bowls, the acoustic mapping, thirty pages of Barnabat's documentation, the specific Dead Zone pocket where the sound had moved through our paws. Three months more, maybe less. Pellaboo had been shaping the bowl that would have been the centrepiece of the demonstration. Tallibat had been measuring the coupling effect in the forward section — right where the spring load came down.

The charge said I had caused that.

The charge had never been in the forward section. Had never felt the bowl's voice move through the old clay and return changed. Had never pressed paws to pre-formation earth and understood that the earth was not an inert medium but a participant, a voice, something that spoke back when spoken to correctly.

I thought about Morillaboo at the ceremony. Looking at my paws. Not my face — my paws. The clay still on them from the fourteen minutes of digging Barnabat clear. I had not understood what the look meant at the time. I thought about it now.

She wasn't dismissing me. She wasn't accusing me. She was looking at the only thing, in that corridor, that still told the true account of what had happened underground. The paws that had read the collapsed wall and found the window before the geometry committed. The paws that had been learning to listen since I was eight years old in the Groves, pressing them flat and feeling the earth breathe.

The answer was not above. It was not going to come from an appeal or an administrative review or a Council hearing or anything that operated at the surface. The decision had been made. That version existed now and would continue to exist, and there was nothing above the old springline's depth that was going to change it.

Cornelibat had said Hangbat was underground. Somewhere in these tunnels.

That was one more thing the surface couldn't tell me.

Choose accurate, he had said. When you find yourself choosing between accurate and safe, choose accurate.

Below was accurate.

### Downward

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: The Descent
Hoebat leaving the Groves burrow at fifteen — not toward the surface, not toward the city grid, but down. Following the North-West Corridor past where the school route ended. Below the broken lights. Below the compromised springline, failed now, the water still seeping. Into the deep tunnels that the Council calls Dead Zones and nobody maintains and nobody maps. Going into the dark that doesn't belong to anyone. Alone. Fifteen. Absolutely certain about everything. Style: the departure, the descent, underground solitude, the wrong direction becoming the right one.
-->

I went underground.

Not a plan — wombats don't plan their way into the earth, they go when the surface has stopped being the place where anything true is happening. But it wasn't escape either. It was direction.

The kids' stories about the crystals. The feeling of being watched in the fifth month. Pellaboo's bowl in my pack and the unfired signal pot that no one above would ever let me fire. If there was something down there attending, I had, at minimum, the right equipment to attend back.

Below was the only direction that pointed toward the truth of what had happened. Everything above pointed toward that version.

The North-West Corridor first, then past where the school route ended. The dead lights I'd walked under every morning for four years. Below the failed springline, the seepage had traced new paths in the clay, following the old logic — water finding the direction it wanted, regardless of what had been sealed above it. The breach had done what the springline had been doing in miniature for eight years: released what had been held. The earth had renegotiated.

Below the breach, the grid-tunnel infrastructure ended. No boring-profile. No chalk lines. The quality of the walls changed under my lamp's light: from the machine-smooth flatness of everything engineered to be smooth, to the slightly uneven, slightly organic surface of material that had been read before it was worked. Old digging. The kind done by wombats who were in conversation with the earth rather than instruction on it. In places the tunnel bent to follow a seam. In places it narrowed not because a boring machine had set its width but because the earth here was doing something that the digger had decided not to interrupt.

The old diggers had been dead for a long time. Their decisions were still in the walls. I moved through them in the small circle of my lamp's knowing, the dark beyond it complete in a way that grid-tunnel dark is not — the dark that has never been interrupted, that was dark before there were eyes to fail in it.

I kept going.

### The Root Cathedral

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The Root Cathedral (Sulpoyána)
The Root Cathedral — a chamber shaped not by wombat paws but by the roots of long-dead trees, severed by the city above over decades. The walls follow root-path geometry: fractal, non-repeating, organic. Faint lichen light. A whisper at one end becomes a hum at the other — the chamber's shape transforming the sound. Hoebat stands at the entrance, fifteen years old, three days' clay on his fur, understanding something he has no words for. Cornelibat's stories made architecture. The city above doesn't know this is here. Style: sacred space, organic geometry, ancient and present, discovery, the threshold of change.
-->

Three levels below the Academy's foundation: the Root Cathedral.

Found it by sound, not map.

A whisper at one end of the chamber arrives at the other end as something else — not bounced, not echoed. Transformed. Richer. The chamber's geometry has its own grammar: it takes what you offer and returns something more than what you gave, the way certain questions open rather than close. I whispered and what came back was a hum. Not my voice anymore. Something larger, using my voice as an entrance.

The walls followed root-paths — long dead, or severed by the city pressing its foundations down from above without asking what was already there. Not round, not straight: fractal. The geometry of growth rather than construction. The wall records every decision the root ever made about where to go, right down to the smallest filament's pressure against the clay — a library of choices, all of them made in the dark, all of them reading the earth rather than imposing on it. A space that had not been constructed but accumulated, over whatever time the roots of surface trees take to write their paths through pre-formation clay.

The lichen in the deepest wall-cracks gave off a light so faint it was more a quality of the dark than a contradiction of it. I stood at the chamber entrance and understood something: there are spaces that don't belong to the city above, don't belong to the Council's categories, don't belong to any Tally. They just exist. They were existing before anyone needed to name them and they'll be existing after the last name is gone.

I stayed three days.

The first day I moved around the chamber's edges, learning its shape the way you learn new ground: paws first, then ears, then the sense in the deep parts of the chest that has no name but is always the most accurate. The temperature here was not cold exactly — more the specific absence of warmth that means a space has been uninterrupted for a very long time. I slept where the root-paths on the floor made a kind of bed, against a wall that breathed more slowly than anything I'd ever felt.

The second day I understood that the chamber had a memory. Not in any mystical sense — just that a space shaped over centuries by living things, then preserved by their absence, carries the record of everything it has been. The roots were gone. Their paths remained. The shape they had made while living was the shape I was inhabiting now. I was sleeping in the record of their lives.

The third day I took out Pellaboo's cracked crystal bowl. Struck it once, gently, with the wrapped striker from the workshop.

The sound didn't echo. It coupled.

The root-path geometry — the fractal curves, the specific way the chamber gathered and directed — found something in the bowl's full voice and answered. Not one note: all of them. The bowl's complete range reaching the cathedral's stone and root and clay, and the cathedral returning each voice changed, adding its own part to the conversation, the whole chamber moving with it the way the earth in the Groves moved when I pressed my paws flat as a child and listened and felt what I felt. The sound moved through the soles of my paws, up through the small bones of my feet. The bone received it before the ear did. Then the ear opened to what the bone had already known.

That was the Wail.

Not ceremony. Not ritual. Not mythology.

Just this: the right instrument, the right space, the earth remembering how to listen.

I understood then what Tallibat had been measuring. What Pellaboo had been shaping toward. What the signal-pot drawing in the mis-shelved library file had been preserved for. The Dust-Bearers hadn't just sung to the earth. They'd found the spaces where the earth sang back, and built instruments for the conversation.

### The First Repair

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The First Repair
Hoebat working in the Root Cathedral tunnels — paws in living clay, reading a crack before touching it, then sealing it. Not with Grout. With the clay's own material, pressed back toward where it wants to be. Grain-running cracks: left alone. Against-grain cracks: addressed carefully. The work is slow and exact. The walls hold under his paws. He is fifteen and has already decided which records he is keeping. Style: solitary craft, underground intimacy, the beginning of mastery, clay and patience.
-->

Not for anyone. Not for the Tally. The walls were cracking — the city's weight shifting above, old seams opening where two soils met the clay layer at depth. I knew how to read it.

Grain-running cracks: left alone. The earth returning to where it wanted to be. Touch these and you stop the healing.

Against-grain cracks: addressed with the clay itself. I'd press the material back toward where it wanted to go — not Grout, just the same clay as the wall, shaped by my paws following the direction of the grain. The work was slow. It required the kind of attention that starts in the body and works outward: not thinking about what your hands are doing, but letting your hands know the wall before you decide anything. Where the wall wanted to close, it was already closing. Where it wanted help, the clay came slightly away from your paw when you pressed. You learned to feel the difference between these.

The charge on my record said I had caused a collapse.

I worked daily in the sections the system had written off, doing the thing the system said caused collapses.

The walls held.

The work organized the days without organizing the grief, which was separate, which moved through me at its own pace and on its own schedule, unrelated to anything I was doing. Sometimes in the middle of a repair I would have to stop and press my paws flat against the floor and breathe until the ground's patient weight became more present than what I was carrying. Sometimes that helped. Sometimes I just waited, which is the same thing in a different posture.

I kept Pellaboo's bowl. I kept Tallibat's notes. I kept Barnabat's ciphered observations — a better account of what pre-formation crystal does in the old clay than anything the Academy's courses contained, worth keeping precisely because the Academy's courses didn't contain it. Worth keeping because Tallibat and Pellaboo had died trying to build something true, and that truth deserved to survive the official account.

The name Hangbat stayed in the back of my mind the whole time. *He's underground,* Cornelibat had said. Just that. Set down carefully at the edge of a sentence, not to be moved.

I was underground too. Fifteen years old, in a chamber the city didn't know existed, repairing walls nobody had asked me to repair.

My father's brother was somewhere in these tunnels. I didn't know where. I didn't know how to look. I worked, and listened, and let the earth keep its own records, and waited to find out what listening long enough would eventually teach me.

### The Bowl That Waits

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 9: The Bowl on the Ledge
Years later — or perhaps just days, time moves differently in the deep earth — Hoebat places the cracked crystal bowl on a ledge in the Root Cathedral. A small offering. Not to the Cathedral, not to any institution. Just to the memory of what Pellaboo was shaping, what Tallibat was measuring, what they were all trying to build. The bowl catches the faint lichen-light. The chamber hums around it, accepting. The past and the present in conversation through the sound. Style: memorial, quiet offering, the persistence of craft, underground stillness.
-->

Years later — or maybe days; time underground moves by different measures than time above. Not faster or slower. Just differently organized: around depth and quiet and the occasional sound from above that reminds you the city is still happening at its own pace while down here the pre-formation clay takes its centuries and considers.

I placed Pellaboo's cracked crystal bowl on a ledge in the Root Cathedral.

The crack ran from the bowl's base to its mid-wall — a grain-running crack, the earth's own method applied to crystal. At its narrowest point, it had begun to seal, the material filling in slowly over the weeks I'd had it with me. The bowl was doing what the Root Cathedral walls had been doing for centuries: healing itself according to its own logic, without being asked.

Not as memorial. The dead don't need memorials — the need is ours, not theirs. I placed it because the bowl still sang. The crack had opened new voices in it, harmonics that hadn't been there when the crystal was whole. Pellaboo would have noted this: *third bowl, failed, repaired — additional harmonic range, cause under investigation.* She would have been working out what caused it before the bowl finished singing.

The chamber received it. This is the only word. The bowl sat on its ledge and the Root Cathedral arranged itself around it the way it had been arranging itself around things for as long as it had been a chamber — with complete patience, with the attention of something that has learned to wait.

The past was very present here. Not as memory — memory is personal, subject to revision. This was different: the root-paths in the walls, the geometry of lives that had been lived and then ended and left their shapes in the clay for whatever came after. Tallibat and Pellaboo had been in this earth. Their paws had touched these walls. Their lamps had made the dark the way my lamp made it now. The earth had received them and was receiving me and made no distinction between us. All of it was the same to the pre-formation clay — a brief warm presence, moving and then gone, leaving whatever traces it left.

I struck the bowl once.

The full voice of the crystal opened into the chamber, found the root-path geometry, and came back richer — carrying something of stone and dark and the three-hundred-year record of the trees that had written this space. For a moment the whole chamber breathed. Not metaphor: the walls moved, imperceptibly, as they always moved in response to struck crystal, the specific micro-adjustment of material receiving and returning vibration.

The earth answered.

I kept working. I kept listening. I kept the records the Tally didn't know how to keep.

And somewhere in these tunnels, my uncle — Hangbat, the listener, the one who went underground before I was born and never came back — was still digging. Still reading the earth. Still practicing in the dark beneath a city that had forgotten how to hear.

I would find him. Or he'd find me. Or we'd dig toward each other until our tunnels met, the way the Dust-Bearers had always found each other: not by signal, not by map. Just by following the grain of the earth toward wherever it led.

The bowl sang. The chamber answered.

And somewhere in the dark, I thought I could hear Cornelibat's voice — not speaking to me, just speaking, the way he always did, stories tumbling out like water finding its level.
