### The Crack That Heals

I came home from the Academy in the early hours, after the Tally-stone and Barnabat's silence in the corridor. Neither Cornelibat nor Agathaboo had slept. The burrow was the kind of quiet that happens when two wombats are both pretending to sleep, both listening to the other pretend.

I thought he might not have a story for this. In all my childhood, through every scraped knee and broken toy and injustice witnessed, Cornelibat had always found a story — the Kitten Who Lost Her Whisker, the Wall That Held Anyway, the Father Who Said Nothing. But I had never been expelled before. I had never been called reckless, responsible, a danger to my friends. I thought perhaps this was too big for stories.

At dawn, Cornelibat made tea and sat at the entrance, watching the eucalyptus. After a while he said: "Come here, Hoebat. Sit. The eucalyptus is moving in the first light—see how the leaves show their silver undersides? The wind is changing."

I sat, but I didn't feel like sitting. I felt like digging, like running, like doing anything other than being still in the place where I'd grown up believing there were answers.

"There is a type of crack," he said.

He didn't look at me. He looked at the trees, at how the morning light caught the leaves.

"There is a type of crack that runs with the grain of the earth. With the direction the material naturally moves. When you find one, it looks like failure. The inspector sees it and reaches for the Grout. But what it actually is—what it truly is—is the earth healing. The material moving back toward the position it wants to be in. If you leave it alone, it seals itself."

He drank his tea. I watched the steam rise and dissipate.

"And then there is the other kind. The kind that runs against the grain. Different geometry. Different direction. A Dust-Bearer learns to tell them apart—not from the width, not from the length. From the direction."

He put down the tea.

"The grain-running cracks get Grout. Always. Because they look bad, and a Grout-inspector's job is to eliminate things that look bad. You seal a grain-running crack with Grout, you stop the earth doing what it was doing. The tunnel cannot heal itself anymore. Six years. Eight years. The stress the crack was releasing has nowhere to go."

He stopped. I knew the rest, but I waited anyway.

"The tunnel fails. And the Grout-inspector's report says: see, the crack was the problem. We sealed it. Something else failed."

He turned to look at me for the first time that morning.

"The crack was the solution."

Silence. The eucalyptus moved. First light.

"Keep your head down."

IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Third Story
Dawn in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat at the entrance with his tea, watching the eucalyptus. Hoebat behind him, not yet sat down — still standing, the night's weight on him. The story begins. In the air between them, the crack: grain-running, healing, the specific geometry of earth doing its own repair. And next to it, the Grout seal placed over it — clean, official, white. Covering the thing that was fixing itself. Style: dawn light, father and son, the story as the last bridge between them.

### The Hypocrite

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Argument
The argument in the Groves burrow. Cornelibat still at the entrance, not turning around. Hoebat standing behind him — fifteen years old, charged, expelled, and now being told to be quiet by the person who taught him the earth was worth listening to. The specific violence of a story used to justify its opposite. The burrow that used to be warm, now just a space where two correct things are incompatible. Style: domestic confrontation, father and son, the wrong kind of quiet, the gap between a principle and its application.
-->

I stared at the back of his head for a long moment.

"You just told me," I said, "that the tunnel failed because someone sealed the thing that was healing it."

He said nothing.

"You told me the Grout-inspector sealed the crack because it looked bad. And the sealing was what killed the tunnel. Not the crack."

He was very still.

"And now you're telling me to be the Grout."

"That's not what I said."

"That is exactly what you said. Keep your head down. Don't make noise. Don't be the thing that looks bad, even if the thing that looks bad is the thing that's healing." My voice came out calmer than I felt. Something had gone cold in my chest, the way earth goes cold when you dig below a certain depth. "The Council sealed you. You lost your certification, your guild, twenty years of your career. You ended up in the Groves digging your own burrow in clay because they put Grout over a grain-running crack and called it fixed. And now the crack is telling you: this is what happened to me, here's the lesson — and you're telling me to *comply.*"

"You are fifteen years old."

"I know how old I am."

"You do not know what this costs." He turned then, finally — and his face had the expression of a wombat who has been through a thing and survived it and the survival was not a victory. "I know exactly what the record does to you. I know every room it closes. I know the Tally-number that follows you. I know, because I lived it, and I am still living it, and if you think this burrow in the Groves with no grid-access and no certification is what I planned for my life then you do not understand what they took." His voice stayed level. That was the worst part. Completely level, the way you're level when you're describing something that happened a long time ago and you've had to get level about it to keep going. "I am not telling you to stop believing what you believe. I am telling you that they will take everything if you give them a reason."

"They already took everything," I said. "Tallibat is dead. Pellaboo is dead. The crystal bowl she was shaping for the Wail is buried under thirty tonnes of pre-formation clay. My Tally says I sent them in there. Barnabat is signing his name to that because his father's reputation is worth more to his family than I am." The cold in my chest was spreading. "What exactly is there left to protect?"

He didn't answer.

That was the part I couldn't forgive. Not the advice. The silence after the advice ran out. The moment when there was nothing left to say because he was right and I was right and the two things were incompatible and he knew it.

"You're a coward," I said.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: Cornelibat's Silence
Cornelibat's face in the moment after Hoebat calls him a coward. He doesn't argue. He doesn't flinch. He looks like a wombat who has just heard an accurate diagnosis and has nowhere to put it. The eucalyptus outside. The burrow that smells of clay and stringybark. Agathaboo visible in the background, still, not intervening. The specific awfulness of a silence that doesn't defend itself. Style: quiet devastation, character portrait, the weight of a word that's true.
-->

I did not mean it as an insult. I want to be clear about that, even now. I meant it as a diagnosis. I was fifteen years old and I was absolutely certain about everything and I thought diagnosing the problem was the same as solving it.

He didn't argue. That was the moment — not the charge, not Barnabat, not the High Auditor with his clear stone. The moment I understood that there was a kind of damage that went so deep it didn't argue back. My father, who had told me Morribat and the woman who waited and the crack that heals, who had spent my entire childhood filling me with the principle that the earth speaks and the only honest work is listening — he looked at me calling him a coward and he had nothing.

Not because it wasn't true. Because it was.

Agathaboo was in the back of the burrow. She didn't come forward. She'd done the calculation too.

### What Was Buried

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Workshop Remains
Hoebat in the hidden workshop below the Academy, alone, gathering what remains. The crystal singing bowl — cracked but not destroyed, the one Pellaboo had nearly finished before the collapse. The drumming pot, unfired, waiting. Tallibat's notes, water-stained but legible. Barnabat's ciphered documentation. The evidence of what they'd been trying to build. Hoebat packing these things carefully, not sure why he's taking them, just knowing they can't be left for the Cathedral to classify as "uncontrolled resonance materials." Style: aftermath, preservation, the remains of a dream, quiet grief.
-->

I went back to the Academy that night. Not to the entrance — to the maintenance level, the service tunnels that connected to our hidden workshop. I wasn't supposed to be there. I was expelled. The charge was on my record. But I needed to see what was left.

The workshop was untouched. The Cathedral hadn't found it. They'd taken Barnabat's statement, charged me, and never looked deeper. Why would they? The narrative was complete: reckless student, unauthorized digging, tragic accident. The crystal deposits, the singing bowls, the attempt to rediscover the Wail — none of it fit the story they were telling, so none of it existed.

I gathered what I could carry. Pellaboo's nearly-finished crystal bowl — cracked in the collapse's aftermath, but still holding its shape. The unfired drumming pot. Tallibat's notes on resonance coupling, written in his careful hand, the formula-kid trying to document something that resisted formulae. Barnabat's ciphered notebooks, full of observations about substrate density and crystal formation that no Academy course had taught him to make.

I didn't know why I was taking them. Just that they couldn't stay here. Just that someone had to remember what we'd been trying to do.

### Downward

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 5: The Descent
Hoebat leaving the Groves burrow at fifteen — not toward the surface, not toward the city grid, but down. Following the North-West Corridor past where the school route ended. Below the broken lights. Below the compromised springline, failed now, the water still seeping. Into the deep tunnels that the Council calls Dead Zones and nobody maintains and nobody maps. Going into the dark that doesn't belong to anyone. Alone. Fifteen. Absolutely certain about everything. Style: the departure, the descent, underground solitude, the wrong direction becoming the right one.
-->

I went downward.

Not a plan. Wombats go into the earth. It's what we do when the surface fails and the city fails and the one person left who was supposed to know what to do has just agreed, silently, that there's nothing to be done. Below was the only direction nobody had filed paperwork on yet.

The North-West Corridor: five years of walking past it every morning, five days a week, noting the broken lights and the Category 2 flag and the compromised springline that was no longer compromised because it had fully failed now, water still seeping through the breach into the lower sections. I had walked this route a hundred times on the way to school. Below where I knew it, it continued.

I followed it down.

The deep tunnels were not grid tunnels. Shaped by paws that didn't know about boring profiles — old diggers, the slow method, following the earth. In places you could see where the tunnel had bent around a composition change rather than cut through it. Ran parallel to a seam. The walls had the uneven organic texture of real digging, the record of a decision being made slowly.

Someone had been reading the earth here a long time ago.

I kept going.

### The Root Cathedral

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: The Root Cathedral (Sulpoyána)
The Root Cathedral — a chamber shaped not by wombat paws but by the roots of long-dead trees, severed by the city above over decades. The walls follow root-path geometry: fractal, non-repeating, organic. Faint lichen light. A whisper at one end becomes a hum at the other — the chamber's shape transforming the sound. Hoebat stands at the entrance, fifteen years old, three days' clay on his fur, understanding something he has no words for. Cornelibat's stories made architecture. The city above doesn't know this is here. Style: sacred space, organic geometry, ancient and present, discovery, the threshold of change.
-->

Three levels below the academy's foundation, I found the Root Cathedral.

Not by map. By sound.

A whisper at one end of the chamber arrives at the other as something else — richer, fuller, the sound changed by the passage rather than merely bounced. The walls are shaped by root-paths, long dead or severed by the city pressing its foundations down from above without asking what was already there. Not round. Not straight. Fractal. The geometry of growth, not construction.

I stayed for three days without fully understanding why. I had nowhere to be — but that wasn't it. Something in the Root Cathedral was Cornelibat's stories made architecture. The Dust-Bearers reading the earth, and here the earth had read itself. The roots wrote it before they died. The city pressed from above for decades and never found it.

The Council's maps had this section as Category 2 — monitored but not maintained. The category meant nothing here. The earth maintained itself.

On the first day, I took out Pellaboo's cracked crystal bowl. I struck it once, gently, with the wrapped striker I'd carried from the workshop.

The sound didn't just echo. It coupled. All seven chakra tones — 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 — the frequencies the Cathedral had discarded in favor of their single 'miracle tone.' The Root Cathedral's walls — the root-path geometry, the fractal shape, the specific way the chamber directed vibration — the bowl's full-spectrum resonance found something in the stone that answered. For a moment, the whole chamber seemed to breathe.

That was the Wail. Not a ceremony. Not a ritual. Just this: the right instrument, the right space, the earth remembering how to listen.

I understood then what Tallibat had been trying to build. What Pellaboo had been shaping in the crystal. What the Dust-Bearers had known that the Cathedral had forgotten.

### The First Repair

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The First Repair
Hoebat working in the Root Cathedral tunnels — paws in living clay, reading a crack before touching it, then sealing it. Not with Grout. With the clay's own material, pressed back toward where it wants to be. Grain-running cracks: left alone. Against-grain cracks: addressed carefully. The work is slow and exact. The walls hold under his paws. He is fifteen and has already decided which records he is keeping. Style: solitary craft, underground intimacy, the beginning of mastery, clay and patience.
-->

Not for anyone. Not for the Tally. The walls were cracking — the city's weight shifting above, old seams opening where two soils met the clay layer. I knew what that meant. I knew how to read it.

Grain-running cracks, I left alone. The earth doing its own repair — Cornelibat's story, applied. Against-grain cracks, I addressed. Not with Grout. With the clay itself, pressing the material back toward where it wanted to go, following the direction of the grain.

The charge on my record said I caused a collapse.

I worked, daily, in the sections the system had written off, doing the thing the system said caused collapses.

The walls held.

I kept Pellaboo's bowl. I kept Tallibat's notes. I kept Barnabat's ciphered observations about substrate density, about the way crystal pockets formed in pre-formation clay, about the specific frequencies that made the earth answer.

I kept them not for revenge. Not for justice. Just because they were true. Because Tallibat and Pellaboo had died trying to build something real, something that sang, something that connected wombats to the earth the way the Dust-Bearers had connected, and that truth deserved to survive even if the Tally said it was Gross Negligence.

The name Hangbat was in the back of my mind the whole time. *He's underground,* Cornelibat had said. Just that. The stone set down carefully on the edge of a sentence, not to be moved.

I was underground too. I was fifteen years old, working in the dark in a chamber the city didn't know existed, repairing walls nobody had asked me to repair, in tunnels the Council had named Dead Zones.

My father's brother was somewhere in these tunnels.

I didn't know where. I didn't know how to look. I worked, and listened, and let the earth keep its records, and waited to find out what listening long enough would eventually teach me.

### The Bowl That Waits

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 8: The Bowl on the Ledge
Years later — or perhaps just days, time moves differently in the deep earth — Hoebat places the cracked crystal bowl on a ledge in the Root Cathedral. A small offering. Not to the Cathedral, not to any institution. Just to the memory of what Pellaboo was shaping, what Tallibat was measuring, what they were all trying to build. The bowl catches the faint lichen-light. The chamber hums around it, accepting. The past and the present in conversation through resonance. Style: memorial, quiet offering, the persistence of craft, underground stillness.
-->

Years later — or perhaps it was just days, time moves differently when you're not keeping Tally — I placed Pellaboo's cracked bowl on a ledge in the Root Cathedral.

Not as a memorial. Memorials are for the dead, and the dead don't need them. I placed it because the bowl still sang. The crack hadn't killed the resonance — just changed it, opened new harmonics, made the voice more complex. Pellaboo would have appreciated that. She'd always said the best bowls were the ones that surprised you.

I placed it because this was where it belonged. Not in the Academy's evidence locker. Not in the Cathedral's classification system. In a chamber the roots had grown, where the earth remembered how to listen, where a whisper became a hum became something else entirely.

Tallibat had wanted to build instruments that could speak through the substrate. Pellaboo had wanted to shape bowls that sang the earth's own frequencies. Barnabat had wanted to document everything, to build a record that would survive any one of us.

They didn't get to finish.

But I was still here. The Root Cathedral was still here. The cracked bowl was still here, still singing when struck, still coupling with the chamber's root-path geometry.

The Wail wasn't a ceremony. It was a practice. A way of being in relationship with the earth. And practices don't need institutions to survive. They just need someone to keep doing them.

I struck the bowl once. The seven tones opened into the chamber — 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963 — the full spectrum the Cathedral feared because it couldn't be controlled. The sound found the walls, returned changed — richer, fuller, carrying something of the roots and the clay and the weight of the city above.

The earth answered.

I kept working. I kept listening. I kept the records the Tally didn't know how to keep.

And somewhere in these tunnels, my uncle — Hangbat, the listener, the one who went underground before I was born and never came back — was still digging. Still reading the earth. Still practicing the Old Way in the dark beneath a city that had forgotten how to hear.

I would find him eventually. Or he would find me. Or we would simply dig toward each other until our tunnels met, the way Dust-Bearers have always found each other — not by map, not by signal, just by following the grain of the earth toward wherever it led.

The bowl sang. The chamber answered. The work continued.

And somewhere in the dark, I thought I could hear Cornelibat's voice — not speaking to me, just speaking, the way he always did, the stories tumbling out like water finding its level. The Counter Who Never Counted. The Earth That Waited. The Son Who Dug Downward. I couldn't tell anymore which stories were his and which were mine. Maybe they had always been the same.
