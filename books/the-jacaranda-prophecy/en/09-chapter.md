# Chapter 9: The People Who Got Lost

<!--
BONUS IMAGE PROMPT: Chapter Cover Image
Deep underground Melborow — below the Dead Zones, below the Root Cathedral, in the unmapped sections the Council stopped naming. Warm light from clay-oil lamps. Wombats living in curved burrows, children playing in the tunnels, a whole community in the sections the city threw away. At the centre: Hangbat — old, unregistered, cracked and mended, already looking at Hoebat like he expected him. In one corner, ghosted: young Hoebat (eight years old) at the edge of the deep tunnel entrance, being pulled back by Agathaboo's paw. Tagline: "The People Who Got Lost." Style: underground community, warmth in the deep, the lost who are not lost.

### Eight Years Old

I snuck into the deep tunnels once before any of this. I was eight. I want to be clear that I knew it was forbidden — not by law, not by Tally-code, but by the specific kind of family prohibition that doesn't need to be stated because it lives in the way your parents go slightly still when a topic gets near.

The topic was: what was below the Groves.

IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Child's Attempt
Eight-year-old Hoebat at the edge of the deep tunnel entrance below the Groves margin. His paws are on the walls. The tunnel goes down at an angle he's never seen — not the gentle grade of grid tunnels but a real descent, following the earth. He can feel something from it. He doesn't have words for what he feels. He goes two tunnel-lengths in. The light from the Groves becomes a pale suggestion behind him. He keeps going. Style: childhood exploration, the draw of the deep, small figure in a large tunnel, the specific quality of going somewhere you've been told not to.

The Groves ran along the eastern margin, and the margin had edges. One of those edges was a section where the Groves' clay gave way to the older substrate beneath — deep blue, pre-formation, the kind that had been there since before anyone thought to build a city above it. There was an entrance there. Not a made entrance — a natural passage, the earth having opened a way down the way earth sometimes does when it wants to. The old diggers had followed it once, probably. Nobody followed it now.

I knew it was there because of the feeling. Every time I pressed my paws to the Groves floor and tried to listen, the something I was listening for was stronger in that direction. Closer, and deeper.

I went in two tunnel-lengths on a Wednesday afternoon when Agathaboo was running assessments and Cornelibat was at the surface-farm irrigation meeting.

The light from behind me became a suggestion. The feel under my paws became clearer — the specific not-quite-sound I'd been chasing, stronger here than anywhere I'd found it, coming up from below. I went a third tunnel-length.

Agathaboo's paw closed on the scruff of my neck.

She didn't yell. She never yelled. She carried me back to the entrance by the scruff — I was small enough that this was still a viable retrieval method — and set me down in the Groves light and looked at me for a long moment with an expression that I filed away and did not understand for several years.

"People get lost down there," she said.

"How?" The tunnels had felt more navigable to me than the grid tunnels, not less — cleaner information coming up through the earth, clearer sense of direction.

"They go looking for something," she said. "And they find it. And they don't come back." She straightened up. "Come help me with the irrigation check."

That was all she said.

I went with her. I pressed my paws to the surface-farm soil while she ran her measurements, and I thought about the feel of the deep tunnel under me — the specific quality of it, the particular patience — and about Cornelibat saying *he's underground* in the voice he used for the Morribat story.

People get lost down there.

Some of them were Hangbat.

### The Long Way Down

Now I was fifteen, expelled, with a charge on my Tally-record and a direction I was going because it was the only direction that hadn't filed paperwork on me yet.

The Root Cathedral had been the beginning. I'd stayed three days, started repairing, found the specific quality of the work — the grain-running and against-grain, the clay's own preference, the earth's record of what had passed through it. I went deeper. Not a plan. The feel under my paws kept being informative, kept having something to say, and I had stopped having anything better to do than listen.

IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Descent Continues
Hoebat moving deeper through the unmapped tunnels below the Root Cathedral. Not frightened — working. His paws on the walls as he moves, reading as he goes. The tunnels change quality: older, deeper, the earth becoming something pre-Grout, pre-formula, pre-Council-notation. Clay that has not been touched by any maintenance schedule. Natural passages following the earth's own logic. He's been down here two weeks. He's not lost. He knows exactly where he is: he's where the earth is still talking. Style: solo descent, reading the earth, the deep tunnels as information-rich space.
-->

The tunnels below the Root Cathedral were older than any of the Dead Zones. The Council's Temporal Cropping had never reached them because the Council's mapping had never reached them — the quarterly reports stopped two levels up, where the last Tally-assessment had noted "structurally inert, no commercial value" and moved on. Below that notation: nothing. Blank on every official map. The kind of blank that means we didn't look, formatted to look like we did and there was nothing there.

I had been in the blank for two weeks when I smelled the fire.

### The People Who Got Lost

IMAGE PROMPT 3: The Underground Community
The deep-tunnel community — wombats living below the Council's mapping, in the sections the city threw away. Curved burrows dug into ancient clay. Clay-oil lamps burning in alcoves. Children playing in the tunnel corridors. Washing hung between support posts. A communal fire-pit in a wider chamber, wombats gathered around it. Not primitive — adapted. The infrastructure is good, maintained by people who know what they're doing. It is simply invisible to the city above. Hoebat stands at the edge of the firelight, looking in. Style: hidden community, warmth in the deep, underground society, organic architecture, life in the margins.
-->

Not a cook-fire. Something older — the specific warm-clay smell of a fire that's been burning in a chamber for a long time, season after season, the walls darkened with its history. I followed it through a low passage that opened into a wide chamber, and I stopped.

Wombats. Maybe thirty of them, maybe more — in the chamber and in the burrows branching off it, their entrances visible from where I stood. Children in the tunnel corridors. A wombat I didn't know hanging washing between two support posts that had been driven into the chamber floor with the particular care of someone who intends to be there for a long time. Lamps in clay alcoves — oil, not Frequency-powered, the light warm and directionless, touching everything equally.

The burrows were well-made. Not grid-tunnel construction, not academy-profile bores — made in the Old Way, curved and organic, following the earth. They were better than most of what I'd seen in the Dead Zones above. The walls had the smooth packed quality of clay that had been worked and reworked over years, each repair making the previous repair part of the structure.

Nobody had registered this address. Nobody above knew it was here.

A wombat near the fire looked up when I came in. Not startled. The look of someone who had seen new arrivals before and was taking the same inventory they always took: what you're carrying, how you're holding yourself, whether you came because you were running from something or running toward something.

"How far down did you come from?" she asked.

"Root Cathedral. Two weeks."

She nodded. "You were reading as you walked."

It wasn't a question. She'd read it in the way I'd come in — paws at wall-height, slight angle of attention.

"Sit down," she said. "You look like you haven't eaten properly."

Her name was Burraboo. She'd been in the deep tunnels for eleven years. She'd come down the same way most people came down — from above, from a situation that had run out of workable options, into the dark that didn't belong to anyone. She ran the chamber's maintenance schedule. She knew every crack in every wall of the settlement by name, almost, the way you know the faces of people you've lived with long enough.

"There are others like this?" I asked, eating the pressed clay-bread she'd handed me without asking.

"Up and down the deep system. Not connected — you have to know the routes. Some have been here longer than this one. Some are new." She looked at me. "Some move between them."

"Who maintains the passages between?"

She smiled. Not at me exactly — at something she was remembering. "Ask Hangbat."

### The Archive

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: Hangbat
Hangbat — old, unregistered, cracked and mended in the specific way of things that have refused to break completely. He sits in a side-tunnel, not at the communal fire, working on a wall with one paw — not patching, reading first, the way Hoebat does it. His Tally-number doesn't exist. His address doesn't exist. He has been in the deep tunnels since before Hoebat's father was charged with Unauthorised Substrate Consultation. He looks up when Hoebat comes in, and the expression on his face is not surprise. Style: character portrait, the last practitioner, weight of years, recognition.
-->

He was in a side-tunnel off the main chamber, not at the fire. Working on a wall — not patching, reading first, paw flat against the clay, the order of operations I'd developed without knowing it was an order of operations.

Old. Cracked and mended in the way of things that have refused to stop. No Tally-tag on his belt. No registration mark. The particular density of a wombat who had been somewhere long enough to become part of it.

He didn't look up when I came in. Then he did — and his expression was the expression of someone who had been expecting a thing and was noting that the thing had arrived.

"Cornelibat's boy," he said.

Not a question.

"Yes," I said.

He went back to the wall. His paw moved across the clay with the specific quality of listening — the quality I'd been practicing since I was eight years old pressing my ear to the Groves floor. He found something, paused. Pressed with two fingers. The clay moved very slightly under his touch — the wall adjusting, taking what was being given.

"Sit down," he said. "You've been in the deep tunnels two weeks and you haven't slept properly."

"How do you know?"

"Same way I know you're Cornelibat's boy. The way you came in. The way you're holding your paws." He didn't look at me. "Sit."

I sat.

Hangbat and Hoebat in the side-tunnel. Hangbat working on the wall. Hoebat watching, learning the order of operations by watching someone who has been doing them for longer than Hoebat has been alive. Not a lesson — a practice, visible, being observed. The clay between them. The lamp in the alcove. Two wombats, different ages, the same attention. Style: craft transmission, observation, the beginning of something, underground intimacy, clay and light.
-->

The Council calls the deep tunnels Dead Zones.

I understood, sitting in that side-tunnel watching my father's brother read a wall, that the term was not careless. It was strategic. A Dead Zone is not just unmaintained — it's unregistered, unaccounted for, outside the Tally's ability to levy fees or issue permits or levy charges. You cannot charge Gross Negligence against work done in a space that officially doesn't exist. You cannot cite a maintenance code for a section that isn't in the code.

You cannot exile someone from a place the city doesn't know about.

"Agathaboo said people get lost down here," I said.

Hangbat made a sound that wasn't quite a laugh. "Some do. The ones who come looking for the same thing they left behind." He moved his paw along the wall. "Your father's charge — what did they call it?"

"Unauthorised Substrate Consultation."

"Yes." He found something, pressed. "He was listening when the Tally said there was nothing to hear." A short pause. "The Tally was wrong. There is always something to hear. The question is only whether you're quiet enough."

He stepped back from the wall.

"You're not listening yet," he said. "You're feeling. It's the beginning of listening. You've been practicing the instrument. You haven't started playing." He looked at me properly for the first time — taking the same inventory Burraboo had taken, but differently. Deeper. "Your father sent a good foundation."

"My father told me to keep my head down."

"Yes," Hangbat said. "He would." He picked up his lamp. "Come. I'll show you what I maintain."

He moved into the passage without looking back to see if I was following.

I was following.
