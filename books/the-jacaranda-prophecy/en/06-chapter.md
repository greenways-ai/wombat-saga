### The One Who Waited

My father never ran out of stories. Just when I thought I'd heard them all — the Digger Who Went Too Deep, the Clay That Remembered, the Inspector's Shadow — he would produce another, seemingly from nowhere, as if the earth itself whispered them to him in his sleep.

I was eleven, on the edge of my Academy years, when he told me the second story about the Dust-Bearers.

It was evening in the Groves, the kind of tired evening when the city felt too close and the eucalyptus wasn't moving enough to clear the air. He'd made tea and sat at the burrow's entrance, looking at the clay wall instead of the trees — at the paw-prints in it, the history pressed there by generations of digging. I recognized the posture. The storytelling posture.

"You have asked me about the Dust-Bearers twice now," he said. "I will tell you a second story. Whether it is the same story or a different one, I leave to you to determine."

He didn't look at me. He never looked at me when he was telling important stories. He looked at the clay, at the tea, at distances.

"There was a Dust-Bearer whose name did not survive. The guild stopped keeping records of our kind two generations before she worked—our kind, I say, though I was never so brave as this one. What remains is an account written by a colleague, forty years after the fact, found in an estate clearance, passed through three pairs of paws before it reached mine."

His voice lowered, not dramatically, but into the register he used when the story required intimacy. I pressed my paws against the floor and listened.

"She was hired to assess a tunnel section in what was then the new deep grid—an expansion bore, green, the Grout not yet fully set. She arrived. She sat down on the floor. And she did not move."

He sipped his tea. I watched the steam rise in the cooling air.

"The foreman checked on her at midday. Still sitting. He checked again at the end of the shift. Still sitting. He assumed she was broken—bad hire, strange wombat, not worth the rate. He went home."

Outside, the trees moved. Cornelibat watched them.

"She sat for three days. On the fourth, she stood, took one paw-width off the eastern lining in a section already signed as complete, and redirected the bore by four degrees north. The foreman documented his objection. The change was made anyway—she had the guild authorization, you see, though I do not know who in the guild was wise enough to give it."

He paused longer than usual. I waited. I'd learned this about his stories—they ended when they ended, not when the listener expected resolution.

"Six months later, the original line would have intersected a salt intrusion they had not mapped. It would have eaten through the Grout in two years. Cost the project three times what the whole bore had cost."

He turned the tea cup in his paws.

"She charged for three days' sitting and four degrees of correction. The guild tried to reclassify the sitting as non-billable. She appealed."

Silence. The first light was coming through the stringybark.

"Did she win?" I asked.

Cornelibat looked at his tea, not at me.

"I do not know. But the tunnel held."

IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Second Story
Evening in the burrow. Cornelibat with his tea, tired, telling the second story. Hoebat older now — eleven, twelve, at the edge of the academy years. The eucalyptus outside, familiar and constant. The story takes shape in the air between them: a Dust-Bearer in an old tunnel, sitting in the dark, refusing to dig until the earth had finished speaking. Not meditating — waiting. The way you wait for a crack to show you where it's going before you touch it. Style: intimate evening, older child listening, the patience of the old method.
-->

I filed the story somewhere in the back of my head next to Morribat and the name Hangbat and the quality the earth had under my paws when I pressed them flat in the dark.

What I didn't understand yet was that the Dust-Bearers weren't just listeners. They were makers too.

### The Commute

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Commute Sequence
The daily journey from Groves to Sector 7 Academy: a series of three panels. First: Hoebat in the Groves margin, clay smell, real air. Second: the Wet Bend, condensation dripping, the one place in the grid you can smell moisture. Third: the academy entrance, Grout-sealed, formula-straight, perfectly lit. The physical contrast of each environment visible in the surfaces, the air quality, the body posture. Hoebat the same in each — paws against the ground when possible, noting the change. Style: transition sequence, contrast, sensory detail.
-->

The Sector 7 Academy accepted me at ten, technically, and I started at eleven because Agathaboo felt I needed one more year of the clay before the formula. She was right. I didn't know that at the time and told her so at length.

The commute was thirty minutes each way, same route every day until it became the only version of Melborow I knew: out of the Groves, through the margin where the smell changed from eucalyptus to condensation, into the Wet Bend where water pooled in the invert without a service charge — one of the last honest places in the city — past the North-West Corridor with its broken lights and its compromised springline that the Council had been noting in quarterly reports since before I started school.

The springline flag was Category 2. I read the reports in the academy library once I was old enough to find them. Category 2 required quarterly monitoring. Category 1 required emergency repair. The category never changed. I walked past that springline five days a week for four years and it stayed at Category 2 the way some things stay at Category 2 forever, right up until they don't.

Safety Grout Geometry. Static-Logic. The official position: the earth is dead material. Inert. A problem to be solved by correct application of formula.

I sat in the back with my paws on the floor. The substrate hummed under the Grout — a different quality than the Groves, compressed, distant, like hearing a conversation through a wall. The curriculum continued above it, as if the earth wasn't there. As if the hum was interference to be filtered out rather than signal to be heard.

I thought of Cornelibat's stories — the ones about wombats who listened, who waited, who knew the earth was alive beneath their paws. The Tunnel That Breathed. The Clay That Knew Its Name. I pressed my paws harder against the floor and listened anyway, storing the hum in my memory like one of my father's stories, to be unpacked later when I had the words.

### Barnabat

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: Barnabat
Barnabat — a young wombat, bright-faced, already showing the particular confidence of someone who has found the angle in the system. He and Hoebat sit together in the back of an academy classroom, Hoebat's paws on the floor, Barnabat's paws occupied with a stylus he's spinning. The instructor at the front with a formula on the board. Barnabat watching Hoebat with curiosity rather than mockery. The beginning of a friendship. Style: classroom scene, back-row solidarity, character dynamic, two approaches to the same world.
-->

Barnabat sat next to me starting in the second week, after the kid who'd originally taken that seat transferred to Sector 4 and left a gap. He slid in and watched me press my paw to the floor for thirty seconds, then said: "Does it tell you anything useful?"

"Sometimes."

"Like what?"

"Where the water wants to be. Whether the wall's decided yet."

He thought about this. "Decided what?"

"Whether it's going to hold."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Can you teach me?"

"No," I said. "You have to figure out what you're listening for first."

He tried it the next day. Pressed his paw to the floor in the corridor, looked at the ceiling, announced that he felt nothing. I told him that was correct and he'd learn to work with that.

This was the beginning of a friendship. I am trying to remember it accurately, without the editing that the later thing does to the earlier thing. Barnabat was good. He was smart, funny, genuinely curious about what I was doing — not performing curiosity, actually curious. He was also practical in a way I respected: he understood the system we were in and was already thinking about how to move through it with minimum friction. He wasn't cynical about it. He just had his eyes open.

His father was a senior Tally-Assessor at the Cathedral — not Cathedral Council, not quite that high, but the kind of position where the family name was part of the credential. The kind of position that a scandal could damage without touching the man directly, the way water damages foundations without ever appearing on the surface.

### The Drumming Pot

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Drumming Pot Discovery
An old diagram or artifact in the Academy library: a cross-section of a Dust-Bearer drumming pot, the kind used to send signals through the earth before the Grid's communication infrastructure. The pot is wide-mouthed, thin-walled, designed to couple with substrate resonance. A note in the margin: "Pre-Frequency communication method. Superseded by Cathedral protocols." Hoebat's paw on the page, Barnabat looking over his shoulder. The pot's design clearly related to Morillaboo's singing bowls, but older, more utilitarian. Style: discovery scene, library research, historical artifact, the Old Way visible in documentation.
-->

The drumming pot appeared in the Academy library's Restricted Stacks by accident. I wasn't looking for it — I was looking for the reports on the North-West Corridor springline, and the file had been mis-shelved.

It was an old technical drawing: *Dust-Bearer Signal Apparatus, Type VII.* The annotation below was in a High Auditor's hand, dated forty years ago: *Superseded by Frequency communication protocols. Obsolete.* The page had a Restricted stamp across it, but someone had left it in the wrong drawer and I found it before anyone noticed.

The drawing showed a pot — not a cooking pot, something else. Wide-mouthed, thin-walled, clay-fired with specific internal geometry. The annotation explained: *Struck with padded striker, couples vibration to substrate. Range: variable, dependent on clay composition. Pre-Frequency communication method.*

I knew what I was looking at. I'd seen Pellaboo's mother make bowls that coupled with the earth's resonance. This was the same principle, applied to communication. The Dust-Bearers hadn't just listened to the earth. They'd spoken through it.

I remembered what Cornelibat had told me: "The Wail is what happens when many bowls sing together. When the resonance couples — when the vibrations find each other through the substrate — something happens. The earth listens back."

Barnabat found me staring at the drawing. "What is it?"

"Drumming pot," I said. "Pre-Frequency. They used these to send signals through the substrate. Before the Cathedral's communication infrastructure."

He looked at the drawing. "That's illegal technology."

"It's obsolete technology. There's a difference."

"Not in the Tally codes." But he was looking closely, curious despite himself. "How does it work?"

"The pot couples vibration to the substrate. Strike it, the vibration travels through the clay. Other pots pick it up. Range depends on the earth's composition — some clays carry it further than others."

"That's not in any of the resonance courses."

"No."

Barnabat was quiet for a moment. Then: "Can we make one?"

I looked at him. He had that expression — the one he got when he'd found an angle in the system, a space between the rules where something interesting might fit.

"The Academy doesn't teach clay-work."

"Pellaboo does. Her mother does." He leaned closer to the drawing. "If we could build one, test it... that's not illegal. That's experimental archaeology. The Academy loves experimental archaeology."

"The Academy loves experimental archaeology that confirms their existing theories."

"Then we don't tell them what we're testing." He grinned — the Barnabat grin, bright and dangerous and completely sincere. "We tell them we're studying substrate acoustic properties. Which is true. We just don't mention the part where we're using methods the Cathedral classified as obsolete."

That was how it started. Not with rebellion. With curiosity. With the desire to make something that worked — really worked — using the earth's own voice instead of the Frequency's imposed signal.

### The Resonance Club

Pellaboo guiding him, showing how to feel the wall thickness. Barnabat documenting everything in his field book. Hoebat holding a half-finished bowl, testing its resonance with a striker. Clay dust in the air. The bowls on a rough shelf — some cracked from failed firings, some holding their shape. The drumming pot in the corner, still unfired, waiting. Style: secret workshop, juvenile craft, the Old Way being rediscovered, underground intimacy.
-->

We needed materials.

Not the Academy's clay — that was processed, standardized, stripped of variation. Pellaboo's mother got her clay from the Groves margin, the pre-formation substrate that the Council's assessment models called "undervalued." But the Groves was thirty minutes each way, and we couldn't explain why four Academy students needed bags of raw clay.

Tallibat found the solution. His father had access to the old survey maps — pre-Temporal Cropping, pre-standardization, from when the Grid was first being planned. The maps marked something called "anomalous crystalline formations" in the sectors below the Academy. The Cathedral had classified them as Category 1 Restricted: "naturally occurring resonance materials, uncontrolled frequency output, do not develop."

"They're beneath the Dead Zones," Tallibat said, spreading the map in our hidden workshop. "The Temporal Cropping already wrote off those sections. No lights, no maintenance, no Tally-value. But the crystal deposits are still there."

"You want us to dig in the Dead Zones," Barnabat said.

"I want us to build instruments. Real ones." Tallibat's voice had that quality it got when he was certain about something — the same certainty he'd had about formula-straight digging, but now pointed in a different direction. "The Cathedral's alloy bowls ring at one frequency. Morillaboo's bowls ring in harmonic series. The Dust-Bearers' drumming pots coupled to the substrate itself. What if we could combine those? Singing bowls made from resonance-crystal clay, tuned to the earth's actual frequencies?"

"For what?" I asked.

"For the Wail."

We all looked at him.

"You know about the Wail," he said. "Everyone knows about the Wail."

The Wail was the Dust-Bearers' ceremony — or that's what the Academy called it. *Pre-scientific ritual practice.* What it actually was, according to Cornelibat's stories, was a gathering where wombats made instruments from earth-materials and played them together, the sounds coupling through the substrate, creating something larger than any individual voice.

"The Wail isn't real," Barnabat said. "It's mythology."

"Morillaboo's bowls are real," Tallibat said. "The drumming pot in the drawing is real. The Wail was real too — it was just technology the Cathedral didn't understand, so they called it ritual."

He was right. I knew he was right because I'd felt it — in Pellaboo's workshop, when her mother's bowl sang and the walls answered. The coupling was real. The earth responded to specific frequencies, specific materials, specific geometries. The Dust-Bearers had understood this. The Cathedral had replaced it with Frequency — one signal, standardized, imposed from above.

"We'd need resonance-crystal," Pellaboo said. "For the bowls to really sing. Clay is good, but crystal couples better."

"The Dead Zones have it," Tallibat said. "The old survey maps show deposits. The Cathedral sealed the records because they couldn't control it."

"We'd be digging in restricted territory."

"We'd be doing experimental archaeology," Barnabat said, with that dangerous grin. "Studying pre-Frequency resonance methods."

That was how we justified it. That was how we made it safe in our heads — four students, fifteen years old, about to risk expulsion for clay and crystal, telling ourselves it was research.

It was more than that. It was the first time any of us had wanted to make something that wasn't for the Tally.

### The Dead Zones

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: The Secret Club Digging
Four young wombats in the Dead Zone tunnels below the academy. Dark, unlisted, Temporal Cropping already withdrawn the lights. They dig by feel — no boring-probe, no chalk lines, no formula. The tunnels curve because they follow the earth. Tallibat working alongside Pellaboo, both careful, both learning. Barnabat and Hoebat in the background, one documenting, one listening to the clay. The other two in the background. The textures: clay walls, organic curves, the rough surfaces of real digging. Not clean, not efficient. Holding. Style: underground adventure, juvenile craft, organic space, low light from handheld lamps, camaraderie.
-->

The Dead Zones were the sections the Council's Temporal Cropping had already written off — no lights, no maintenance schedule, no Tally-value. The academy's building sat above a section that had been unmapped since before the current administration. Three levels below the main campus: tunnels shaped by paws, not bored by machine. Old.

We met there twice a week after hours. Four of us — me, Barnabat, Tallibat, and Pellaboo.

Tallibat brought his boring-probe, which was better equipment than anything the rest of us had, but he used it differently now. Before, he'd run it by the formula — systematic, grid-correct. Now he let Pellaboo guide him. She couldn't explain how she knew where the clay would hold, but she knew, and Tallibat was learning to trust that knowing even when it contradicted his measurements.

"The crystal forms in pockets," she said, running her paws along a tunnel wall. "You can feel it. The clay gets denser. Colder. The earth is holding something there."

Barnabat documented everything. Not for the Tally — his notes were in a private cipher, code we'd developed so that if anyone found them, they wouldn't understand what we'd been doing. *Project Resonance,* he called it in the headers. *Substrate Acoustic Properties.*

It was a good crew. I want to say that plainly. Before what happened, it was a genuinely good crew.

Tallibat and Pellaboo found each other in the usual way — which is to say nobody noticed it happening until it had already happened, and by then it was just a fact of the tunnels, like the mineral smell and the specific dark that doesn't have any light to apologise for. She'd tilt her head north when she was thinking, and he'd adjust his tunnel angle to match her sense of direction without either of them discussing it.

We went deeper each month. Each session ended a little further in than the last, the earth kept being there to dig, and I was fifteen and it was the best thing in my life.

Barnabat got better at it than he thought he would. He never heard the hum the way I heard it — some wombats don't — but he developed a feel for when the clay was holding crystal. He could run his paw along a wall and tell you where to dig, not from sound but from texture, from the way the material responded to pressure.

The tunnels smelled of real clay. That mineral cold.

### The Prize

The crystals catch the lamplight differently than normal stone, seeming to hold the light a moment longer. Tallibat reaches toward one, his expression caught between scientific wonder and something like reverence. Pellaboo beside him, already calculating how to extract samples without damaging the matrix. The moment of discovery, the prize they've been seeking for months. Style: discovery, natural beauty, the sought-after material, underground revelation.
-->

We found the first crystal deposit in month five. Small — just a few formations in a clay pocket, dark blue, nothing like the manufactured resonance alloys the Cathedral used. When struck, they didn't ring clear like the standards demanded. They sang. Harmonics, overtones, the sound opening into itself like Morillaboo's bowls.

"That's not Static," Tallibat whispered, holding a small crystal up to the lamplight. "Look at the grain. The structure. It's—"

"Alive," Pellaboo finished.

We built our first singing bowl from that crystal. Pellaboo shaped it, using her mother's methods but with this new material. It took three attempts — the crystal was harder than clay, less forgiving. But the third bowl held its shape.

When she struck it, the sound was different from anything we'd heard. The crystal coupled with the Dead Zone substrate differently than Groves clay. The vibration traveled further, found harmonics in the tunnel walls that answered back. Not just one frequency — not the Cathedral's 528 hertz 'miracle tone' — but all seven chakra tones singing together: 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, 852, 963. The full spectrum. For a moment, the whole tunnel seemed to breathe with us.

"That's the Wail," Tallibat said, quietly. "That's what the Wail was."

We didn't know the half of it.

The North-West Corridor springline failed on a Tuesday afternoon.

Category 2. Quarterly monitoring required. Never escalated. I'd read the flag a dozen times in the library records, noted the date range, done the arithmetic on how long it had been sitting at Category 2 without becoming Category 1. I'd even thought, once, about filing something — an anonymous concern, a note left in the Maintenance Request box that the academy kept in the main corridor, locked, key available from the principal's office during specified hours.

I had not filed anything. I was fifteen and had enough sense to know what happened to unnotched wombats who put their name on institutional concerns.

The springline went. The load it had been carrying redistributed through the grid tunnels above the Dead Zones — the Grout-sealed sections, rigid and formula-certified, unable to flex, passing the shock downward the way a struck bone passes vibration to the joint above.

The Old Way tunnels, curved and unlicensed: most of them absorbed it. Imprecision bends where formula shatters.

Tallibat and Pellaboo had gone ahead to the forward section. That was their role — Tallibat testing the new crystal pocket, Pellaboo marking extraction points. They'd pushed further than the rest of us that afternoon, into a section where the earth was shallower above and the spring load had been pressing down longest. I'd meant to go with them. Barnabat had found something in his notes — a correlation between crystal density and substrate resonance — and I'd stopped to look at it.

That was the difference. That was all it was.

The forward section took the full load.

The warning came from ahead. Two voices, running toward the cross-passage they'd mapped three sessions back. Pellaboo's first—higher, carrying the tunnel's acoustics in a way that meant she'd aimed it.

"HOEBAT! BARNABAT! GET BACK!"

Then Tallibat, lower, urgent: "THE SPRING! IT'S GOING!"

They were running toward us, not away — sacrificing speed to save us, shouting while they ran. I heard their footsteps, the rhythm of their breathing, the particular weight of their movement on the clay.

Then the geometry shifted.

The sound was not catastrophic. Not an explosion, not a roar. Just the earth renegotiating — the specific acoustic signature of material finding new equilibrium. The forward section where they'd been standing: gone. Buried under the spring's release and the load from above.

They did not make it.

Barnabat was trapped under a collapsed crown section twenty metres behind where they'd been. Not his voice I heard — the earth's translation of his movement. Small, frantic pressure against material that hadn't committed yet to its new geometry.

Style: crisis, craft under pressure, the Old Way applied to an emergency, close detail.
-->

Secondary shifts still moving. The earth renegotiating.

I put my paws on the collapsed wall and listened.

You have a window in a collapse before the geometry commits. After it commits the earth has decided, and digging against a decision is how you find yourself under the same problem. You read the direction of the stress. Find the place where the material is still making up its mind.

Fourteen minutes. Barnabat pulled clear. Secondary collapse starting behind us.

I believed, walking out of that tunnel with him on my shoulder, that I had just proven something. The Old Way works — not as philosophy, not as sentiment, but as engineering. I expected to be in trouble for the unlicensed tunnel. I had already worked out, walking, what I was going to say.

### The Tally-Stone

Style: institutional betrayal, power imbalance, cold light, formal setting, the weight of the wrong conclusion.
-->

The Principal's office smelled like Safety Grout and Tally-dust. A High Auditor from the Cathedral sat across from me with a Tally-stone in his paw. He had not put it down since he arrived. The stone was perfectly clear. Stones don't decide things.

This stone had already decided.

He had a witness statement. Barnabat's name at the bottom.

The language was too precise — written for him, not by him, the syntax of someone who had been helped to find the right words. *Instigator. Ringleader. Reckless excavation technique. Directed subjects into an unsound forward section.* Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation. Unauthorised Substrate Modification.

Tallibat's name in the statement. Pellaboo's name in the statement. The deaths were real. The cause had been reassigned.

I looked at the Auditor. I looked at the door. I had been the one standing with Barnabat when the springline went. I had stopped to look at a wall reading. I had not gone ahead with them. The statement described this as *deliberate distance from the hazard zone* — as if I'd known. As if the wall reading was a cover. As if I had sent Tallibat and Pellaboo into the forward section and stood back.

I thought about Barnabat at fourteen, joining the crew because he trusted me. I thought about Barnabat at fifteen, sitting in an office with a form in front of him and their names on it and a pen in his paw.

He didn't meet my eyes in the corridor afterward.

I understand it. I have had seventeen years to understand it, and I do, completely, which is its own kind of problem. His father's name was on every senior assessment his career would ever need signed off. A mark on Barnabat was a mark on that name — not a fatal one, but the kind that follows, the kind that gets mentioned quietly in rooms Barnabat would need to be in. He was fifteen and he had grown up knowing exactly what his family's standing was worth and what it cost to protect it. He put my name on the statement and took his family's name off it.

That's all it was. Not ambition. Not a promotion. Just a fifteen-year-old who panicked and reached for the thing his whole life had taught him mattered most.

Understanding it did not change what I understood.

I was removed from the Sector 7 Academy. The charge went into the Tally. It followed me in every room I entered from that point forward, invisible, present, the way a compromised springline sits at Category 2 for years doing nothing that looks like damage until the day it does everything.

Cornelibat, when I came home, went very still.

Not sadness. Not anger. Recognition.
