Cross-section of Melborow underground: above, the grid-tunnel academy corridors with Grout-sealed walls and formula-straight bores. Below, the unlicensed Dead Zone tunnels — curved, organic, running by feel. In the middle: the springline, already compromised, water finding the fault. Hoebat and Barnabat working in the lower section, backs to what's coming. The Tally-stone and the High Auditor's face ghosted in one corner. Tagline: "The Dead Zones."

### The One Who Waited

Cornelibat had a second story he told less often. He told it when he was tired, when the Groves felt too close to the city and the city felt too heavy above us both.

It was about a Dust-Bearer whose name he didn't know — she hadn't left a name in any record, and the guild had stopped keeping records of the Old Way practitioners two generations before she worked. What remained was the account of a colleague who'd watched her work, written down forty years later from memory, found in an estate clearance and passed through three pairs of paws before it reached Cornelibat.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Story
Evening in the burrow. Cornelibat with his tea, tired, telling the second story. Hoebat older now — eleven, twelve, at the edge of the academy years. The eucalyptus outside, familiar and constant. The story takes shape in the air between them: a Dust-Bearer in an old tunnel, sitting in the dark, refusing to dig until the earth had finished speaking. Not meditating — waiting. The way you wait for a crack to show you where it's going before you touch it. Style: intimate evening, older child listening, the patience of the old method.

She had been hired to assess a tunnel section in what was then the new deep grid — one of the expansion bores, still green, the Grout not yet fully set. She arrived, sat down on the floor of the tunnel, and did not move.

The foreman checked on her at midday. She was still sitting.

He checked again at the end of the shift. Still sitting. He assumed she was broken somehow — bad hire, strange wombat, not worth the rate they were paying. He went home.

She sat for three days. On the fourth day she stood up, took one paw-width off the eastern lining in a section the foreman had already signed off as complete, and redirected the bore by four degrees north.

The foreman documented his objection. The change was made anyway — she had the guild authorisation. Six months later the original line would have intersected a salt intrusion they hadn't mapped, which would have eaten through the Grout in two years and cost the project three times what the whole bore had cost.

She charged for three days' sitting and four degrees of correction. The guild tried to reclassify the three days as non-billable. She appealed. There is no record of the appeal's outcome.

Cornelibat always stopped there.

"Did she win?" I asked once.

"I don't know," he said. "But the tunnel held."

I was eleven. I was about to start at the Sector 7 Academy. I filed the story somewhere in the back of my head next to Morribat and the name Hangbat and the quality the earth had under my paws when I pressed them flat in the dark.

### The Commute

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Commute Sequence
The daily journey from Groves to Sector 7 Academy: a series of three panels. First: Hoebat in the Groves margin, clay smell, real air. Second: the Wet Bend, condensation dripping, the one place in the grid you can smell moisture. Third: the academy entrance, Grout-sealed, formula-straight, perfectly lit. The physical contrast of each environment visible in the surfaces, the air quality, the body posture. Hoebat the same in each — paws against the ground when possible, noting the change. Style: transition sequence, contrast, sensory detail.
-->

The Sector 7 Academy accepted me at ten, technically, and I started at eleven because Agathaboo felt I needed one more year of the clay before the formula. She was right. I didn't know that at the time and told her so at length.

The commute was thirty minutes each way, same route every day until it became the only version of Melborow I knew: out of the Groves, through the margin where the smell changed from eucalyptus to condensation, into the Wet Bend where water pooled in the invert without a service charge — one of the last honest places in the city — past the North-West Corridor with its broken lights and its compromised springline that the Council had been noting in quarterly reports since before I started school.

The springline flag was Category 2. I read the reports in the academy library once I was old enough to find them. Category 2 required quarterly monitoring. Category 1 required emergency repair. The category never changed. I walked past that springline five days a week for four years and it stayed at Category 2 the way some things stay at Category 2 forever, right up until they don't.

Safety Grout Geometry. Static-Logic. The official position: the earth is dead material. Inert. A problem to be solved by correct application of formula.

I sat in the back with my paws on the floor. The substrate hummed under the Grout. The curriculum continued above it, as if the earth wasn't there.

### Barnabat

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: Barnabat
Barnabat — a young wombat, bright-faced, already showing the particular confidence of someone who has found the angle in the system. He and Hoebat sit together in the back of an academy classroom, Hoebat's paws on the floor, Barnabat's paws occupied with a stylus he's spinning. The instructor at the front with a formula on the board. Barnabat watching Hoebat with curiosity rather than mockery. The beginning of a friendship. Style: classroom scene, back-row solidarity, character dynamic, two approaches to the same world.
-->

Barnabat sat next to me starting in the second week, after the kid who'd originally taken that seat transferred to Sector 4 and left a gap. He slid in and watched me press my paw to the floor for thirty seconds, then said: "Does it tell you anything useful?"

"Sometimes."

"Like what?"

"Where the water wants to be. Whether the wall's decided yet."

He thought about this. "Decided what?"

"Whether it's going to hold."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Can you teach me?"

"No," I said. "You have to figure out what you're listening for first."

He tried it the next day. Pressed his paw to the floor in the corridor, looked at the ceiling, announced that he felt nothing. I told him that was correct and he'd learn to work with that.

This was the beginning of a friendship. I am trying to remember it accurately, without the editing that the later thing does to the earlier thing. Barnabat was good. He was smart, funny, genuinely curious about what I was doing — not performing curiosity, actually curious. He was also practical in a way I respected: he understood the system we were in and was already thinking about how to move through it with minimum friction. He wasn't cynical about it. He just had his eyes open.

His father was a senior Tally-Assessor at the Cathedral — not Cathedral Council, not quite that high, but the kind of position where the family name was part of the credential. The kind of position that a scandal could damage without touching the man directly, the way water damages foundations without ever appearing on the surface.

He joined the club because he trusted me. That part is true and I hold to it. He joined the club because the unauthorised tunnels were an adventure, and because at fourteen the future is abstract and adventure is concrete, and because he trusted me. I don't think he thought, at fourteen, about what the tunnels would mean if something went wrong. I don't think any of us did.

### The Dead Zones

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Secret Club
Four young wombats in the Dead Zone tunnels below the academy. Dark, unlisted, Temporal Cropping already withdrawn the lights. They dig by feel — no boring-probe, no chalk lines, no formula. The tunnels curve because they follow the earth. Barnabat working alongside Hoebat, both careful, both learning. The other two in the background. The textures: clay walls, organic curves, the rough surfaces of real digging. Not clean, not efficient. Holding. Style: underground adventure, juvenile craft, organic space, low light from handheld lamps, camaraderie.
-->

The Dead Zones were the sections the Council's Temporal Cropping had already written off — no lights, no maintenance schedule, no Tally-value. The academy's building sat above a section that had been unmapped since before the current administration. Three levels below the main campus: tunnels shaped by paws, not bored by machine. Old.

We met there twice a week after hours. Four of us — me, Barnabat, Tallibat, and Pellaboo.

Tallibat brought his boring-probe, which was better equipment than anything the rest of us had, and the understanding that if he was going to do this he was going to do it properly. He never fully let go of the formula. What he found, eventually, was that the formula and the feel weren't opposites — they were two passes over the same information. He'd run his instruments first, Pellaboo and I would listen, and between the three methods we could read a section faster than any of us could alone. Barnabat documented it and watched for Grout lies in the walls above.

It was a good crew. I want to say that plainly. Before what happened, it was a genuinely good crew.

Tallibat and Pellaboo found each other in the usual way — which is to say nobody noticed it happening until it had already happened, and by then it was just a fact of the tunnels, like the mineral smell and the specific dark that doesn't have any light to apologise for. She counted his footsteps for a while, which for Pellaboo was approximately a declaration of intent. He didn't know what it meant and she didn't explain it and somehow that worked for both of them.

We went deeper each month. Each session ended a little further in than the last, the earth kept being there to dig, and I was fifteen and it was the best thing in my life.

Barnabat got better at it than he thought he would. He never heard the hum the way I heard it — some wombats don't — but he developed a feel for when the Grout above was lying. He could run his paw along a certified wall and tell you where the pour had been too thin, where someone had signed off without checking.

The tunnels smelled of real clay. That mineral cold.

### Tuesday Afternoon

-->

The North-West Corridor springline failed on a Tuesday afternoon.

Category 2. Quarterly monitoring required. Never escalated. I'd read the flag a dozen times in the library records, noted the date range, done the arithmetic on how long it had been sitting at Category 2 without becoming Category 1. I'd even thought, once, about filing something — an anonymous concern, a note left in the Maintenance Request box that the academy kept in the main corridor, locked, key available from the principal's office during specified hours.

I had not filed anything. I was fifteen and had enough sense to know what happened to unnotched wombats who put their name on institutional concerns.

The springline went. The load it had been carrying redistributed through the grid tunnels above the Dead Zones — the Grout-sealed sections, rigid and formula-certified, unable to flex, passing the shock downward the way a struck bone passes vibration to the joint above.

The Old Way tunnels, curved and unlicensed: most of them absorbed it. Imprecision bends where formula shatters.

Tallibat and Pellaboo had gone ahead to the forward section. That was their role — Tallibat running instruments on the new ground, Pellaboo reading beside him. They'd pushed further than the rest of us that afternoon, into a section where the earth was shallower above and the spring load had been pressing down longest. I'd meant to go with them. Barnabat had had a question about a wall reading and I'd stopped to look at it.

That was the difference. That was all it was.

The forward section took the full load. They did not make it.

Barnabat was trapped under a collapsed crown section twenty metres behind where they'd been. Not his voice I heard — the earth's translation of his movement. Small, frantic pressure against material that hadn't committed yet to its new geometry.

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 6: The Rescue
Hoebat pressing his paws to the collapsed wall, reading the direction of the stress. Dust settling. Faint sounds from the other side. His face — not heroic, not frightened, working. Fourteen minutes. The specific moment before secondary collapse, visible in the wall texture's change. Barnabat's paw visible at the edge of the dig. Style: crisis, craft under pressure, the Old Way applied to an emergency, close detail.
-->

Secondary shifts still moving. The earth renegotiating.

I put my paws on the collapsed wall and listened.

You have a window in a collapse before the geometry commits. After it commits the earth has decided, and digging against a decision is how you find yourself under the same problem. You read the direction of the stress. Find the place where the material is still making up its mind.

Fourteen minutes. Barnabat pulled clear. Secondary collapse starting behind us.

I believed, walking out of that tunnel with him on my shoulder, that I had just proven something. The Old Way works — not as philosophy, not as sentiment, but as engineering. I expected to be in trouble for the unlicensed tunnel. I had already worked out, walking, what I was going to say.

### The Tally-Stone

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 7: The Auditor
The Principal's office. A High Auditor from the Cathedral sits across from Hoebat. Tally-stone in one paw — perfectly clear, already decided. A witness statement on the table between them. The language is too precise for a fifteen-year-old to have written. Hoebat looks at the statement, then the Auditor, then the door. The calculation happening in real time. Style: institutional betrayal, power imbalance, cold light, formal setting, the weight of the wrong conclusion.
-->

The Principal's office smelled like Safety Grout and Tally-dust. A High Auditor from the Cathedral sat across from me with a Tally-stone in his paw. He had not put it down since he arrived. The stone was perfectly clear. Stones don't decide things.

This stone had already decided.

He had a witness statement. Barnabat's name at the bottom.

The language was too precise — written for him, not by him, the syntax of someone who had been helped to find the right words. *Instigator. Ringleader. Reckless excavation technique. Directed subjects into an unsound forward section.* Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation. Unauthorised Substrate Modification.

Tallibat's name in the statement. Pellaboo's name in the statement. The deaths were real. The cause had been reassigned.

I looked at the Auditor. I looked at the door. I had been the one standing with Barnabat when the springline went. I had stopped to look at a wall reading. I had not gone ahead with them. The statement described this as *deliberate distance from the hazard zone* — as if I'd known. As if the wall reading was a cover. As if I had sent Tallibat and Pellaboo into the forward section and stood back.

I thought about Barnabat at fourteen, joining the crew because he trusted me. I thought about Barnabat at fifteen, sitting in an office with a form in front of him and their names on it and a pen in his paw.

He didn't meet my eyes in the corridor afterward.

I understand it. I have had seventeen years to understand it, and I do, completely, which is its own kind of problem. His father's name was on every senior assessment his career would ever need signed off. A mark on Barnabat was a mark on that name — not a fatal one, but the kind that follows, the kind that gets mentioned quietly in rooms Barnabat would need to be in. He was fifteen and he had grown up knowing exactly what his family's standing was worth and what it cost to protect it. He put my name on the statement and took his family's name off it.

That's all it was. Not ambition. Not a promotion. Just a fifteen-year-old who panicked and reached for the thing his whole life had taught him mattered most.

Understanding it did not change what I understood.

I was removed from the Sector 7 Academy. The charge went into the Tally. It followed me in every room I entered from that point forward, invisible, present, the way a compromised springline sits at Category 2 for years doing nothing that looks like damage until the day it does everything.

Cornelibat, when I came home, went very still.

Not sadness. Not anger. Recognition.
