### The One Who Waited

My father never ran out of stories. Just when I thought I'd heard them all — the Digger Who Went Too Deep, the Clay That Remembered, the Inspector's Shadow — another would arrive. Settle in like a wombat who's been walking for a long time and has finally decided this is the right door.

I was eleven, on the edge of my Academy years, when he told me the second story about the Dust-Bearers.

Late evening, the kind where the city felt close and the eucalyptus was barely moving. He'd made tea and sat looking at the burrow wall instead of the trees — at the paw-prints pressed into the clay there, the history of everyone who'd built this place and come back to it. I knew that posture.

"You've asked me about the Dust-Bearers twice now," he said. "I'll tell you a second story. Whether it's the same story or a different one: that's yours to figure out."

He didn't look at me. He never did, on the ones that mattered.

"There was a Dust-Bearer whose name didn't survive. The guild stopped keeping records of our kind two generations before she worked — *our kind,* I say, though I never had the nerve this one had. What remains is a colleague's account written forty years after the fact, found in an estate clearance, passed through three pairs of paws before it reached mine. Each pair passed it because each pair knew it was worth passing."

His voice dropped into the intimacy register.

"She was hired to assess a new expansion bore. Fresh section in what was then the deep grid's growing edge — sealant not yet fully set, the ground still working out what it thought of the new corridor. She arrived at the start of the morning shift."

He sipped his tea.

"She sat down on the floor. And she did not move."

I pressed my paws flat and waited.

"The foreman checked at midday: still sitting. End of shift: still sitting. He filed her as a problem — bad hire, strange wombat, not worth the day-rate — and went home." Cornelibat turned the cup in his paws. "She sat through the night. She sat through the next day. On the morning of the fourth day, she stood up, walked to the eastern lining in a section already certified and signed off, and removed exactly one paw-width of material from its inner face. Then she told them to redirect the bore four degrees north."

The eucalyptus moved. Barely.

"The foreman documented his objection in three places. But she had guild authorization — I still don't know who in the guild was wise enough to give it — and the bore shifted four degrees north."

He was quiet long enough that I thought the story had ended.

"Six months later, where the original line would have run: a salt intrusion nobody had mapped. The kind that eats through sealed walls in two years and leaves a compromised section degrading quietly for twenty more. The kind that costs three times the project budget to remediate, once someone finally admits the problem was there the whole time."

Silence. Long enough to feel its shape.

"She charged for three days' sitting and one paw-width of correction. The guild tried to reclassify the sitting as non-billable. She filed the appeal herself."

"Did she win?" I asked.

Cornelibat looked at his tea. Not at me.

"I don't know. But the tunnel held."

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 1: The Second Story
Evening in the burrow. Cornelibat with his tea, tired, telling the second story. Hoebat older now — eleven, twelve, at the edge of the academy years. The eucalyptus outside. The story takes shape in the air between them: a Dust-Bearer in an old tunnel, sitting in the dark, refusing to dig until the earth had finished speaking. Not meditating — waiting. The way you wait for a crack to show you where it's going before you touch it. Style: intimate evening, older child listening, the patience of the old method.
-->

I filed that story in the back of my head beside Morribat and the name Hangbat and the quality the earth had under my paws when I remembered to stop arguing with it.

What I didn't understand yet was that the Dust-Bearers weren't just listeners. They were makers too. They sat in the earth until the earth told them what to build, and then they built it. The sitting was only half the work.

### The Commute

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 2: The Commute Sequence
The daily journey from Groves to Sector 7 Academy: a series of three panels. First: Hoebat in the Groves margin, clay smell, real air. Second: the Wet Bend, condensation dripping, the one place in the grid you can smell moisture. Third: the academy entrance, Grout-sealed, formula-straight, perfectly lit. The physical contrast of each environment visible in the surfaces, the air quality, the body posture. Hoebat the same in each — paws against the ground when possible, noting the change. Style: transition sequence, contrast, sensory detail.
-->

The Sector 7 Academy accepted me at ten. Agathaboo made me wait a year — one more year of clay before formula. She was right. I argued at length the entire time.

The commute was thirty minutes each way. Same route every day until the route became the architecture of my thinking: out of the Groves, through the margin where the smell shifted from eucalyptus to condensation, into the Wet Bend where water pooled in the invert without a service charge — one of the last honest corners of Melborow — past the North-West Corridor with its dead lights and its Category 2 flag, same flag every quarter for as long as I could remember, a small yellow notation on the wall that I walked past so often it had become part of the corridor the way the lights were part of the corridor, a feature rather than a message.

Academy classrooms: Safety Grout Geometry, Static-Logic, the official view. The earth is inert material. A problem to be solved by correct application of formula. The instruction continued above the clay floors as if the clay were beside the point — as if the hum I felt through my paws when I pressed them flat was noise to filter rather than information to receive.

I pressed them flat anyway. Stored the hum in my memory the way I stored Cornelibat's stories — without words, to be unpacked later when I had the language for it. Under all that Grout the hum was different than the Groves. Compressed. Patient in a different way — the patience of something that has been waiting a long time and has learned to wait without urgency, because urgency is a surface quality, and this was very deep.

### Barnabat

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 3: Barnabat
Barnabat — a young wombat, bright-faced, already showing the particular confidence of someone who has found the angle in the system. He and Hoebat sit together in the back of an academy classroom, Hoebat's paws on the floor, Barnabat's paws occupied with a stylus he's spinning. The instructor at the front with a formula on the board. Barnabat watching Hoebat with curiosity rather than mockery. The beginning of a friendship. Style: classroom scene, back-row solidarity, character dynamic, two approaches to the same world.
-->

Barnabat took the seat next to mine in the second week, after the original occupant transferred to Sector 4 and left a gap. He watched me press my paw to the floor for thirty seconds, then said: "Does it tell you anything useful?"

"Sometimes."

"Like what?"

"Where the water wants to be. Whether the wall's made up its mind."

"Made up its mind about what?"

"Whether it's going to hold."

He thought about this. Then: "Can you teach me?"

"No. You have to find out what you're listening for first."

He tried the next day — pressed his paw to the corridor floor, stared at the ceiling, announced he felt nothing. I told him that was correct and he'd learn to work with that. He looked at me with the expression of someone who can't tell if they're being mocked and has decided, provisionally, to assume they're not.

That assumption was the beginning of what we had.

Barnabat was good. Smart. Genuinely funny. Curious in a way that wasn't performed — actually curious, the kind where you've stopped needing things to come out a specific way before you're willing to look at them. He moved through the Academy the way experienced wombats move through complex ground: aware of every surface, never surprised by the terrain.

His father was a senior Assessor at the Cathedral — not Cathedral Council, but close enough that the family name was current tender in every administrative conversation in the sector. The Cathedral reviewed work that carried that name differently. It received a fair hearing, a thorough examination, the benefit of all reasonable doubts. Projects under his family's shadow existed in a kind of protected territory — not because rules were bent, but because the name itself meant the work was taken seriously, treated as legitimate inquiry from serious people.

When I told Barnabat about the drumming pot, the first thing he said was: "We document it properly and I put my father in the acknowledgments. The Pre-Grid Studies department hasn't had a primary source submission in four years."

---

### The Drumming Pot

<!--
IMAGE PROMPT 4: The Drumming Pot Discovery
An old diagram in the Academy library: a cross-section of a Dust-Bearer signal pot, the kind used to send signals through the earth before the Grid's communication infrastructure. The pot is wide-mouthed, thin-walled, designed to work with the clay around it. A note in the margin: "Pre-signal communication method. Superseded by Cathedral protocols." Hoebat's paw on the page, Barnabat looking over his shoulder, his expression already calculating the formal submission structure. Style: discovery scene, library research, historical artifact, the Old Way visible in documentation.
-->

The drumming pot found me. I wasn't looking for it — I was looking for the North-West Corridor structural reports in the Restricted Stacks, professional curiosity, and someone had mis-shelved a technical drawing that didn't belong there. I found it before anyone noticed it was findable.

*Dust-Bearer Signal Apparatus, Type VII.* A High Auditor's annotation at the bottom, dated forty years ago: *Superseded by Cathedral communication protocols. Obsolete.* A Restricted stamp across the top.

Wide-mouthed. Thin-walled. Clay-fired. Internal curves built for one purpose: to send a struck vibration into the earth around it and let the earth carry it further than sound could travel through air. *Struck with padded striker, vibration travels through clay composition. Range variable by material. Pre-protocol communication method.*

I knew what I was looking at. I'd spent years in Morillaboo's workshop watching her bowls make the clay walls answer. This was older — the same knowledge applied to distance. The Dust-Bearers hadn't just listened to the earth. They'd spoken through it.

Barnabat found me staring at the drawing. "What is it?"

"Signal pot. Pre-protocol. They sent messages through the clay."

He leaned in. His reading posture was different from his listening posture — the stylus stopped spinning, the head came slightly forward, everything focused. "Where does it transmit to?"

"Anywhere there's another pot. Anywhere with clay that carries."

"Can we build one?"

"Pellaboo's mother makes something close. Her bowls couple with the clay the same way."

He looked at the drawing for a long time. "This isn't in any pre-Grid studies course. Not even the advanced elective." He looked at me. "How much of this is documented?"

"None of it. The Academy's collection doesn't have any primary source material on Dust-Bearer acoustic practice. Everything they have is Cathedral-era, post-suppression."

Barnabat set down his stylus entirely. A decision had been made somewhere behind his eyes.

"My father," he said, "has access to the pre-Temporal Cropping survey maps. There are notations on them — he mentioned them once when I asked about the Dead Zones under the academy. *Anomalous crystalline formations.* Cathedral flagged them Category 1 Restricted and wrote them off. But they're still there." He looked at the drawing again, then at me. "If we could reconstruct a functioning pot — test it, document it, demonstrate the acoustic coupling — that's a first. That's not just an academic submission. That's a guild-certification piece of work."

"The Pre-Grid Studies department—"

"Would give us the presentation slot of the year. My father would review the submission personally." He picked up his stylus. "We'd need the crystal material. We'd need Pellaboo. We'd need Tallibat's boring equipment for the Dead Zone access." He was already writing. "And we'd need to be very precise in how we describe the methodology. *Experimental reconstruction of pre-Frequency acoustic communication methods using historically documented materials.* Nothing there that isn't accurate."

I looked at him. He looked at me.

"We're going to be famous," he said, without a trace of irony. "Academically famous. Which is the best kind."

### Into the Dead Zones

Style: secret workshop, juvenile craft, the Old Way being rediscovered, underground intimacy.
-->

We needed clay that wasn't the Academy's processed, stripped, standardized material — the kind that had been refined until it behaved correctly in every test and communicated nothing except what it had been engineered to communicate. Pellaboo's mother got her clay from the Groves pre-formation stock. But the Groves was thirty minutes each way and the logistics of four Academy students carrying bags of raw earth through the maintenance tunnels were, Barnabat said, *unnecessarily complicated given that we have a more historically appropriate source directly below us.*

The Dead Zones.

The service access was a panel in the sub-level corridor, behind a utility bracket, that the maintenance schedule had stopped visiting once the sections below were classified as abandoned territory. Nobody had locked it. There had been no reason to lock it. The Dead Zones were Category 2, monitored but not maintained, and the assumption was that what was down there was nothing worth the effort of a locked door.

Three levels below the academy campus, the air changed quality.

Not colder — though it was cooler, the temperature falling a degree or two below the grid's regulated warmth. More than temperature: a stillness that was not the absence of movement but the presence of age. The specific patience of earth that had been waiting in the dark for longer than anything above it had been waiting for anything. Tallibat's lamp made a small circle of knowing in that patience. Beyond its edge the dark was complete in a way that grid-tunnel dark is not — this was the dark that had never been interrupted, that had been dark before there were eyes to fail in it.

The tunnels here were shaped by old paws, not boring machines. You could read this in the walls: the slight unevenness of the surface, the way the profile varied with the decisions of whoever had been digging, the places where the tunnel bent around a change in clay composition rather than cutting through it. These were the decisions of wombats who had been listening to the earth rather than imposing a plan on it. The decisions were still there in the walls, precise and legible, the way a note pressed into wet clay stays in the fired pot. Someone had been reading this earth — had been reading it carefully, attending to what it wanted to say — long before anyone built an academy above it.

We found a workshop space in the third session: a chamber where two old tunnels met at an angle that created a natural alcove, walls thick enough to deaden the sound from above. Barnabat surveyed it with the meticulous eye he brought to every problem, measured its dimensions, noted the clay composition in his field book. *Pre-formation clay, dark blue, exceptionally stable.* His notes ran to three pages before we'd put anything down.

"Morillaboo should be cited in the methodology," he said, setting up the portable kiln. "Independent practitioner, Eucalyptus Groves margin. And I want a full acoustic properties appendix — we test every bowl we make against the tunnel walls, document the harmonic series, compare it to the alloy bowl specifications."

"The Cathedral won't like the comparison," Tallibat said.

"The Cathedral doesn't have to like it. They have to acknowledge it." Tallibat had developed a specific quality since his conversion in Morillaboo's workshop — a focused certainty, pointed now toward something rather than away from it. "Their alloy bowls replaced this technology. If we demonstrate that the replaced technology was more sophisticated than what replaced it, that's a finding. The Pre-Grid Studies department is *required* to publish findings."

Pellaboo was already working. She'd brought Groves clay for the early sessions — four bags, carried one at a time over four days, each described to the dormitory corridor as *personal effects.* She shaped the first bowl without measuring anything, her paws knowing what they were looking for. The rest of us watched. There was something in the watching that felt like attending to something important — the way you watch when you understand, even if you couldn't articulate it, that the thing being done is being done by someone for whom it is completely natural, and that the naturalness itself is information.

Tallibat brought his boring-probe. But he was running the dig by Pellaboo's sense of the clay now, not the formula, not the chalk lines. He'd bring the probe to a wall, and he'd wait.

"Crystal forms in pockets," she told him, running her paw along a section of tunnel. "Denser clay, colder. You can feel the earth holding something." Her paw moved in small arcs. "There. The cold changes there."

He pressed his paw beside hers. Waited.

"I feel it," he said, and he sounded genuinely surprised every time, as if each discovery was new evidence for something he'd decided to believe but still couldn't quite credit.

Barnabat documented everything in precise cipher — not to hide it, he said, but for elegance, and because a submission with a methodology section that demonstrated we'd kept private research records would look better than one that hadn't. *We're establishing scholarly provenance,* he said. *The documentation trail is part of the argument.*

It was four of us, twice a week, going deeper each session. Good work. Real work. The kind you feel in your paws as something that matters, not because someone told you it matters but because the earth under you is three hundred years old and giving up its secrets in small careful increments and you are learning, incrementally, the language in which it speaks.

### The Prize

<!--

-->

Month five: the first crystal pocket.

We had gone deeper that session — Pellaboo following a change in the clay that she'd been tracking for two weeks, a slight cooling in the temperature of the walls, a density that spoke to her paws of something gathered and waiting. The lamp's circle moved ahead of us. The old tunnel narrowed, then opened, then narrowed again, and we came around a bend that the original diggers had cut at an angle that had always seemed inefficient until we turned it and understood: they had cut around this chamber, not through it. They had known it was here. They had preserved it.

The crystal grew in clusters along the chamber's far wall. Dark blue, fractal-edged, the formations repeating their branching pattern at every scale. The lamp's light came into them differently than it came into clay or stone — it went further in, moved slower, emerged changed. Tallibat made a sound I'd never heard from him before. Not a word. Just a sound.

"It's different," Pellaboo said quietly, her paw not quite touching a formation. "The clay around it is different too. Feel how cold."

We all felt. The clay at the crystal's boundary had a quality that wasn't quite texture and wasn't quite temperature — a specific density, as if the earth here was paying attention to itself, holding something, had been holding it in the dark for an amount of time none of us had language for.

It took Pellaboo three attempts to shape a bowl from the crystal material. The first two cracked in the cooling — the material was harder than Groves clay, less patient of error, requiring a more exact attentiveness in the shaping. She worked slowly, feeling the material rather than forming it, stopping often to run her paw along the emerging wall, reading what it told her. Barnabat documented each attempt with notes so detailed they ran to eight pages. *Attempt 3: wall thickness 4mm at equator, thinning to 2.5mm at rim, exterior surface hand-smoothed with damp clay, firing temperature reduced by judgment.* The notes were a kind of love — meticulous, specific, refusing to generalize what was particular.

The third bowl held.

When Pellaboo struck it the sound moved through the chamber's floor into the soles of our paws, up through the small bones of our feet, and kept going. Not heard first: felt first. The bone receives it before the ear. Then the ear opened to what the bone had already known, and what the ear received was a voice that did not simplify — every part of the crystal bowl's range reaching the Dead Zone clay and the Dead Zone clay reaching back, harmonics answering harmonics, the chamber moving with it the way old earth moves when something speaks to it in its own language.

I was fifteen years old and I was standing in a pre-formation pocket that the old diggers had preserved, listening to a sound that the Cathedral had spent forty years ensuring no one would hear, and what I felt was not rebellion and not transgression — it was recognition. This was what Cornelibat's stories had always been pointing toward. Not a metaphor. A place. This specific dark, this specific cold, this specific bowl.

"That's the Wail," Tallibat said. Barely audible. A recognition.

"The beginning of it," Pellaboo said. "One bowl. We'd need—"

"Documented first," Barnabat said, already writing. His voice had gone to the register he used when he was completely focused — flat, precise, absorbing. "I need measurements of that acoustic response. Every harmonic we can identify. We're going to need a full appendix." He looked up at me over the field book. "Your father's stories about the Dust-Bearers — every one you can remember — I want them in the historical context section. Primary oral testimony from the Groves tradition." He looked back down, writing. "We're going to walk into the Pre-Grid Studies department with a complete reconstruction. Functioning instrument. Demonstrated acoustic coupling. Historical documentation. Oral tradition lineage. Crystal sample analysis." He turned a page. "They're not going to know what to do with us."

-->

The North-West Corridor springline failed on a Tuesday afternoon in the sixth month of our work.

Pellaboo was shaping the crystal bowl she intended to be the centrepiece of the submission — not the first bowl, not the test piece, but the real one, made with everything the first three months had taught her, walls calibrated to the specific acoustic properties of the Dead Zone crystal, a bowl she said would hold its pitch for longer than any alloy instrument the Cathedral had certified. Tallibat was testing a new crystal pocket in the forward section, measuring its acoustic properties against the pocket we'd already documented. Barnabat was working on the submission structure, the argument running to thirty pages of ciphered notes organized into sections and appendices and a bibliography that included three pre-Temporal Cropping sources he'd found in his father's collection.

I'd meant to go forward with Tallibat. Barnabat had a question about the oral tradition section — how to frame Cornelibat's stories as historical evidence without making them sound like mythology — and I'd stopped to look at his draft.

Ten minutes.

There was no warning in the earth beforehand. No change in the quality of the hum, no variation in the temperature of the walls. Whatever the springline had been accumulating in its years at Category 2 gave no outward sign — the earth around us had been patient and still and entirely itself right up until the moment it wasn't.

The load from above redistributed through the grid sections. The Grout-sealed sections, rigid and formula-certified, passed the shock downward rather than absorbing it. The old tunnels in the Dead Zones, shaped by paws that had followed the earth's own direction, mostly moved and held. But the forward section — the one where the earth above was thinnest, where the spring load had been longest — did not hold.

The warning came from ahead. Two voices running toward us.

Pellaboo's first, aimed exactly at where she knew we were: *"HOEBAT! BARNABAT! GET BACK!"*

Then Tallibat: *"THE SPRING! IT'S GOING!"*

They were running toward us, not away. I heard their footsteps in the clay. The specific rhythm of two wombats at full pace in a tunnel, the breath in it, the weight of them. Then the earth renegotiated — the specific acoustic signature of material finding new equilibrium, one geometry becoming another — and they did not reach us.

They did not make it.

Behind me, Barnabat was trapped under a collapsed crown section. Not his voice I heard — the earth's translation of his movement against the new geometry. Small, frantic, alive.

<!--

Style: crisis, craft under pressure, the Old Way applied to an emergency, close detail.
-->

Secondary shifts still moving. The earth still deciding.

I put my paws on the collapsed wall and listened.

You have a window in a collapse before the geometry commits. After it commits, the earth has decided, and digging against a decision is how you become part of the problem. You read the direction of the stress. Find the place where the material is still making up its mind.

Fourteen minutes. Barnabat pulled clear. Secondary collapse starting behind us.

I walked out of that tunnel with him on my shoulder. I was not thinking yet about what had happened to Tallibat and Pellaboo. I was thinking about what I was going to say when we reached the surface, how I was going to explain the work, how the work itself would make everything clear. The documentation was intact — Barnabat's field book, the crystal samples in their cloth wrapping, the submission draft. We had thirty pages of carefully organized evidence. We had a functional instrument and measurements and oral testimony and a historical argument and Barnabat's father's name in the acknowledgments.

I was still thinking in those terms when I reached the corridor outside the Principal's office.

### The Corridor

<!--

Barnabat two steps behind, head down, not quite meeting anything. Hoebat coming from the other direction, still carrying the weight of the tunnel, clay still on his paws. The moment of not meeting eyes — precise, damaging, all the information contained in a posture. Style: betrayal made physical, the space between two people who both know, institutional corridor, wrong light.
-->

Barnabat came out of the Principal's office as I was walking toward it.

He was with his father. I had never met his father but I knew him by the resemblance — the same quality of moving through institutional spaces as if they had been designed with you in mind, because for some wombats they have been. His father walked with the ease of someone who has just completed a task and completed it correctly. He had his paw briefly on Barnabat's shoulder — not comfort, not pressure. Just placement. *Here. Done.*

Barnabat walked two steps behind him, looking at the floor.

He looked at the floor the way you look at something you have decided to make your entire world for the next ten seconds. The floor had become very important. He studied it with the focused attention he usually brought to his field book, his ciphered notes, the things that mattered enough to document precisely.

I was three metres away. Then two.

His father looked at me — the brief, administrative look of a wombat who has made a decision and has nothing further to discuss. Then he looked past me. They continued down the corridor.

Barnabat did not look up.

I watched his back. The slight tightening across his shoulders. His breathing, which I knew well enough to read from ten metres, told me what his face had not.

I went into the office.

### The Tally-Stone

Style: institutional betrayal, power imbalance, cold light, formal setting, the weight of the wrong conclusion.
-->

The Principal's office smelled of Safety Grout and paperwork. A High Auditor from the Cathedral sat across from me with a Tally-Stone in his paw. He had not put it down since he arrived.

The stone was perfectly clear. Clear stones are supposed to be undecided.

This one had already decided.

He had a witness statement. Barnabat's name at the bottom.

The language was too precise. The syntax of someone who had been shown what the words needed to look like and given a pen. *Instigator. Ringleader. Reckless excavation. Directed subjects into an unsound forward section.* Gross Negligence. Causing Death by Reckless Excavation. Unauthorised Structural Modification.

Tallibat's name in the statement. Pellaboo's name. The deaths were real. The cause had been reassigned.

I looked at the Auditor. I looked at the door. I looked at Barnabat's name at the bottom of the statement and I did not understand it — not yet, not in the way you understand something when you've had time to think about it. I understood it the way you understand an unexpected change in the earth under your paws: as a fact that requires all your attention before you can begin to make sense of it. Something had shifted and I didn't yet know the new geometry.

He didn't meet my eyes in the corridor afterward.

I was expelled from the Sector 7 Academy. The charge went onto the record. The thirty pages of ciphered notes, the crystal samples, the submission draft that had been going to be the Pre-Grid Studies presentation of the year — none of it existed in any official account. The story was complete: reckless student, unauthorized dig, tragic accident. Everything else had ceased to exist.

Cornelibat, when I came home, went very still.

Not sadness. Recognition.
