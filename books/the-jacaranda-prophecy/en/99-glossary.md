# Glossary

**Arnem**  
The fundamental energy or life-force that flows through all things in the world of Arnamland. Sometimes translated as "divine vibration" or "cosmic frequency."

**The Crystalisation** (also: The Great Crystalisation)  
The cataclysmic event that forced the ancestors of modern wombats to retreat underground. The exact nature of the Crystalisation remains mysterious, but its effects included the solidification of Arnem in certain regions and the creation of the Violet Miasma.

**Coring Trees**  
Legendary trees from the surface world whose roots reached deep into the earth, creating the first tunnels that wombats followed to establish their underground civilization.

**The Five Borows**  
The five great underground cities of the wombat civilization: Melborow, Sylborow, Arnbrow, and two others lost to history.

**The Five Sovereigns**  
The ruling council of Melborow, each representing a different aspect of wombat society: Architecture, Resources, Frequency, Defense, and the Tally.

**Frequency**  
In the context of Melborow society, refers to both the literal vibrations used for communication in the tunnels and the metaphorical "frequency" of acceptable thought and behavior maintained by the Sovereigns.

**Haze, The**  
A protective atmospheric phenomenon on the surface of Arnamland. The necessity of the Haze is questioned by some and defended by others.

**High-noses**  
A term for wombats who claim lineage from the ancient surface-dwelling nobility. Often used derogatorily.

**Kappa Mu**  
A secret society dedicated to preserving knowledge of the Old Ways and resisting the total control of the Five Sovereigns. Their name comes from the Greek letters κ and μ, representing their motto: *Knowledge Moves* (or *Keep Moving*).

**Tally, The**  
The massive bureaucratic system that tracks every wombat's productivity, contributions, and social worth through notched stones. Maintained by the Magistrate of the Tally.

**Old Ways, The**  
The traditions, knowledge, and practices of the wombats who lived on the surface, before the retreat underground. Includes concepts like "servicing the land" and direct communion with Arnem.

**Static, The**  
Also known as Tejas in ancient texts. A state of heightened awareness or communion with the fundamental nature of reality. Risky to achieve but powerful.

**Tejas**  
See: The Static.

**Violet Miasma**  
A dangerous phenomenon that appears in certain deep or forbidden tunnels. Its nature is poorly understood, but contact with it can cause crystallization or madness.
