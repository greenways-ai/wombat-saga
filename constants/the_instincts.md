## What Are Instincts?

In the Arnamland cosmology, a **Instinct** (Power) is not a gift from a god or a mutation from the Static. It is a natural byproduct of extreme structural alignment.

When a creature practices a **Thread** (a fundamental law of reality) for long enough, the friction between their will and the world disappears. The world stops resisting them. To an observer, this looks like magic. To the practitioner, it just feels like the path of least resistance.

The Instincts are not "learned." They are "unlocked" when the practitioner stops trying to manipulate the world and starts embodying the Thread.

## The Ten Instincts

### 1. The Unshakeable Gaze (The Platypus Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 1 (The Baseline)
*   **The Power:** The ability to see the "Source Code" of reality, ignoring all layers of illusion, branding, and social pretense.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner's mind automatically filters out "Noise" (lies, jargon, ego). They perceive only "Signal" (Intent).
*   **The Effect:** You cannot lie to them. If you try, they will look at you with a blank, flat stare that makes you feel physically transparent. They don't hear your words; they hear what you are trying to hide.
*   **The Cost:** Social isolation. Small talk becomes impossible when you can see the existential dread behind the question "How are you?"

### 2. The Obsidian Sight (The Dingo Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 2 (Forensics)
*   **The Power:** The ability to see what is *missing*.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner's vision is drawn not to the object, but to the negative space around it. When reading a report, their eye skips the text and lands on the blank line where a transaction was deleted. When looking at a crowd, they see the empty chair where a victim should be sitting.
*   **The Effect:** They can reconstruct a crime scene or a financial fraud just by looking at the "clean" version. The cleaner the story, the clearer the lie.
*   **The Cost:** Cynicism. It is hard to enjoy a beautiful sunset when you are involuntarily calculating the pollution index that causes the colors.

### 3. The Elemental Scan (The Koala Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 3 (Diagnostics)
*   **The Power:** The ability to read and regulate the "Temperature" of a room or a person.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner perceives emotions as thermal gradients. Rage is heat. Fear is cold. Grief is heavy dampness. They can adjust their own internal state to "Thermostat" the environment—cooling a riot with presence, or warming a depressed borow with attention.
*   **The Effect:** They can walk into a violent conflict and, without saying a word, cause the combatants to lower their weapons because the "Heat" has simply vanished from the air.
*   **The Cost:** Emotional porosity. They feel the temperature of everyone around them, often requiring periods of deep isolation (The Sacred Darkness) to reset their baseline.

### 4. The Resonance Link (The Wallaby Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 4 (Integration)
*   **The Power:** The ability to function as the "Central Nervous System" of a group.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner dissolves their individual ego boundary to include the squad. They feel the physical fatigue, stress, and location of every team member as if it were their own body.
*   **The Effect:** Instantaneous, non-verbal coordination. The Wallaby dodges a blow that was aimed at the Emu behind them. The team moves as a single organism.
*   **The Cost:** Shared damage. If the Wombat breaks a leg, the Wallaby limps.

### 5. The Golden Repair (The Rosella Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 5 (Synthesis)
*   **The Power:** The ability to heal a fracture by making it the strongest part of the structure.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner can see the "Gold" (the potential for higher unity) hidden inside a conflict. They speak a language that validates both sides simultaneously, creating a "Third Reality" where the conflict becomes a collaboration.
*   **The Effect:** They can turn enemies into allies in a single conversation. They don't compromise (50/50 split); they synthesize (1+1=3).
*   **The Cost:** They are often despised by purists on both sides for "diluting" the cause.

### 6. The Friction Engine (The Kangaroo Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 6 (The Practice)
*   **The Power:** **Anti-Fragility.** The ability to convert stress into strength.
*   **The Mechanic:** Most creatures deplete energy when they work. The practitioner generates energy *from* the resistance. The harder the ground, the stronger the dig. The stronger the opponent, the faster the punch.
*   **The Effect:** Infinite stamina as long as the resistance holds. They only tire when the fight stops.
*   **The Cost:** They cannot rest. Peace feels like death. They constantly seek out conflict or hard labor just to feel alive.

### 7. Seismic Proprioception (The Wombat Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 7 (Lived Experience)
*   **The Power:** The extension of the body schema into the environment.
*   **The Mechanic:** The tool (shovel) and the medium (earth) become part of the practitioner's nervous system. They can feel a vibration in the rock face through the handle of a pickaxe. They can feel the foundation of a building settling through the soles of their feet.
*   **The Effect:** They can detect structural failures days before they happen. They can navigate in pitch darkness by feeling the "pressure" of the walls.
*   **The Cost:** Hypersensitivity. They cannot tolerate synthetic environments (plastic, grout) because they feel "dead" to the touch.

### 8. The Null Hold (The Ascended Dingo Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 8 (The Bridge)
*   **The Power:** The generation of a "Gravity Well" through absolute stillness.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner enters a state of zero-thought (Sunyata). This creates a vacuum in the psychic field. Nature abhors a vacuum, so the chaos of the room rushes in to fill it—and is neutralized by the practitioner's silence.
*   **The Effect:** They can stop a panic or silence a crowded room just by sitting down and breathing. They become the eye of the storm.
*   **The Cost:** They become invisible. People literally bump into them or forget they are there, because they are emitting no "Signal" for the ego to latch onto.

### 9. Blind Navigation (The Emu Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 9 (Systems Logic)
*   **The Power:** The ability to see the Map without seeing the Territory.
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner perceives the world as a web of causal relationships. They don't need to see the door; they know where the door *must* be based on the airflow and the echo. They don't need to see the bug in the code; they know where it is based on the system's output pattern.
*   **The Effect:** They can move through unknown, dangerous, or dark environments with perfect confidence. They always know the way out.
*   **The Cost:** They struggle with the "Here and Now." They are always seeing the "There and Then." They trip over the rock in front of them because they are looking at the mountain range.

### 10. The Field State (The Galah Instinct)
*   **Thread:** 10 (Unified Truth)
*   **The Power:** **Total Flow.** The dissolution of the "Doer."
*   **The Mechanic:** The practitioner stops being a noun (Wombat) and becomes a verb (Digging). There is no "I" left to doubt, fear, or fail. The action performs itself through the body.
*   **The Effect:** Perfect execution. The "Violet Resonance." The scream that is exactly the right pitch to shatter the glass. The dig that removes exactly the right amount of dirt.
*   **The Cost:** Ego death. It is terrifying to come back to the "Self" after being the "Field." The practitioner often struggles with identity crises.

## The Dust-Bearer Manifestations

In the Golden Age of Arnamland (~Year 400-800), the **Dust-Bearer** guilds did not just practice their trades; they embodied the Instincts to such an extreme degree that their labor became indistinguishable from magic. The "Top Echelon" elders of each Mu displayed specific manifestations of the Threads.

### 1. Kintsugi-Mu (The Menders) -> Instinct 5 (The Golden Repair)
**The Manifestation:** **The Instant Seal.**
The Elders of the Third Root could press a paw against a fractured tunnel wall and, without adding new clay, cause the existing substrate to re-knit itself. They didn't just fill the crack; they convinced the earth that the crack was an opportunity for higher density. A wall healed by a Kintsugi-Mu Elder would often glow faintly with Arnam-light for weeks, and that section would never break again, even if the rest of the tunnel collapsed.

### 2. Karst-Mu (The Defenders) -> Instinct 6 (The Friction Engine)
**The Manifestation:** **The Living Pillar.**
A single Karst-Mu Elder could hold up a collapsing ceiling section weighing twenty tonnes, not through muscle strength, but through **Structural Alignment**. They positioned their bodies at the precise geometric fulcrum of the load, converting the downward pressure of the rock into kinetic potential. The heavier the rock, the more immovable the Wombat became. They could hold the pose for days, their breathing slowing to one inhalation per hour, effectively becoming a stone pillar with a heartbeat.

### 3. Tahl-Mu (The Tillers) -> Instinct 7 (Seismic Proprioception)
**The Manifestation:** **The Root-Pulse.**
The Tahl-Mu Masters did not need to dig to find the best soil; they could feel the nutritional density of the earth through their feet from three sectors away. An Elder could walk through a barren tunnel and, by stomping a specific rhythm, "wake up" the dormant root systems embedded in the walls, causing sweet-tap tubers to sprout and mature within hours. They were walking fertilizers.

### 4. Dhal-Mu (The Water-Readers) -> Instinct 3 (The Elemental Scan)
**The Manifestation:** **Hydraulic Telepathy.**
The Dhal-Mu could taste the history of water. By touching a damp wall, an Elder could trace the water's path back to its source rainfall three years prior. They could detect poisons, blockages, or shifts in the aquifer miles upstream. In times of drought, they could stand in a dry room and "sweat" the location of the nearest hidden spring, their bodies acting as a dowsing rod that pulled the entire squad toward survival.

### 5. Ghar-Mu (The Rememberers) -> Instinct 2 (The Obsidian Sight)
**The Manifestation:** **The Time-Walk.**
When a Ghar-Mu Elder performed the Old Way Dance, they didn't just recite history; they projected it. The rhythm was so precise that it created a localized resonance field where the past became visible to onlookers. Listeners would hallucinate the events being stomped—seeing the Great Flood or the First Treaty overlaid on the tunnel walls like a ghost-image. They could spot the "missing beat" in a lie instantly, because a lie has no rhythm.

### 6. Vahl-Mu (The Breathers) -> Instinct 4 (The Resonance Link)
**The Manifestation:** **The Atmospheric Hive.**
The Vahl-Mu Breath-Masters could synchronize the breathing of three hundred wombats in a crowded tunnel. By regulating their own respiration, they could calm a panic, lower the group's oxygen consumption during a collapse, or spread a silent command through the air like a pheromone. They turned a mob into a single organism that moved, breathed, and acted with one lung.

### 7. Sutr-Mu (The Weavers) -> Instinct 9 (Blind Navigation)
**The Manifestation:** **The Network Step.**
A Sutr-Mu Elder could send a message to the other side of Arnamland just by tapping a root, but their true power was **Propagated Awareness**. If they were touching a root system, they *were* the root system. They could see through the "eyes" of a tree five kilometres away. They could navigate the entire city with their eyes closed because they could feel the location of every other root-touching creature in the grid.

### 8. Nakh-Mu (The Pathfinders) -> Instinct 8 (The Null Hold)
**The Manifestation:** **The Void Walk.**
The Nakh-Mu could walk through a crowded market without being seen, heard, or remembered. They mastered the art of "non-displacement." They moved through the air without creating a wake and stepped on the ground without creating a vibration. In a collapsing tunnel, they could find the "Null Space"—the single pocket of air that would not be crushed—and simply exist there, untouched by the falling stone, protected by their absolute lack of resistance.
