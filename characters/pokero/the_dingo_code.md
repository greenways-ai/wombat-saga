# The Dingo Code

*A memory shared by [[../../characters#Pokero (The Dingo)|Pokero]] to [[../../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]] during the long night before the Assembly.*

***

You want to know why a Dingo runs with wombats, Hoebat? Sit down. Put your paws in the dirt. I'll tell you the same way Uncle Hangbat told me — with the truth at the bottom and the story on top.

I was born in the Wild Lands. Not the romantic version — not the red-sand postcard that the High-Noses frame in the Cathedral gift shop. The real Wild Lands, where the soil is so old it remembers the taste of the first rain, and the wind carries the scent of things that died before the Tall-Ones had names.

My mother was a runner. Not "running from" — that's a wombat word. Running *with*. She ran with the dawn across the Gibson flats until the heat pushed back, and then she ran with the dusk until the cold pulled her home. She was the fastest thing below the horizon, and she never once asked anyone's permission to move.

My father ran the **[[../../lore#The Static (The Digital Fester)|Static Fields]]**. That's a different kind of running. The Tall-Ones dump their data-waste into the ground — all the forgotten code, the algorithmic refuse, the digital rot that leaks from their machines into Arnamland like sewage into a river. Most creatures fear the Static. It pools in the low places, corrupts the unwary, turns good soil into fever-mud. But the Dingoes? We learned to *read* it. We developed **Static-Logic** — the art of filtering the God-Waste, repurposing the digital refuse, turning the Tall-Ones' garbage into currency. My father built the first Static-Unit in the Western borows. A crew of Dingoes harvesting what the Humans discarded, getting rich off the excess data that the wombats were too afraid to touch.

The other Dingoes got fat on the Static. Built empires. The Static-Unit bosses in the Western borows now have more Root-Credits than Vitabat's enforcers can count. But my father — I don't talk about my father. Not because of the Static. Because of what the Static showed him, and what it cost.

You know what they say about Dingoes in Melborow, Hoebat. I've heard it since I was a pup, when my mother brought me south because the Wild Lands were going cactus and the water holes were drying into dust-bowls.

"Lock your borow, the Dingoes are here."

"They don't dig, they just take."

"They've got the teeth but not the roots."

Trumbat didn't invent that fear. He just bottled it. Put a label on it. Sold it back to frightened wombats who needed someone to blame for the cracking walls that the **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Yellow Monsters]]** were actually breaking.

### The Teeth

Here's the thing about Dingo teeth, Hoebat. They're real.

I don't pretend they're not. I've got a jaw that could crack a femur, and every Lo Snout in the Gray Grotto knows it. When I walk through the market, the old mothers pull their joeys closer. They don't see Pokero. They see Predator.

And the worst part? They're not entirely wrong.

I felt it first when I was twelve. The hunger that isn't about food. I was playing with a wombat kid — a Lo Snout girl called Minna, stubby legs, couldn't run to save her life. She tripped in the dust and I heard her fall, and something in me... shifted. A frequency beneath the Frequency. Ancient. Pre-verbal. My eyes locked on her and I felt my weight drop to my front paws and my mouth opened before my mind caught up.

I didn't bite.

But I *wanted* to.

That night I ran to the edge of the Western borows and howled until my throat was raw. Not because I was sad. Because I was terrified of what I was. A creature designed for the chase living in a world that had decided chasing was barbaric.

### Uncle Hangbat and the Code

That's when I found him. Or he found me.

Uncle **[[../../characters#Uncle Hangbat (The Beggar Fool)|Hangbat]]** — your uncle, Hoebat, though he claims every lost creature as kin — was sitting at the edge of the Western borows, wrapped in a filthy rag that might once have been a ceremonial sash. He smelled like fermented root and eucalyptus sap and something else — something old. Like the caves beneath the caves.

"Howling again," he said. Not a question.

"I almost bit someone today."

He didn't flinch. Didn't lecture. He just reached into his rag and pulled out a tooth. Not a Dingo tooth — a wombat tooth, old and yellow, cracked down the middle and filled with something golden.

"You know what this is?"

"A broken tooth."

"It's the first **[[../../lore#The Maha Tahto (The Great Truth)|Kintsugi]]** repair ever performed in Arnamland," he said. "A wombat cracked this tooth biting a stone he was too proud to spit out. Instead of pulling it, the elders filled the fracture with Arnam-gold. The break became the strongest part."

He held it up to the Dingo-Light — the stars that wombats were forbidden to look at.

"The Code isn't about denying your teeth, boy. It's about choosing where you sink them."

He told me the **Dingo Code** that night. Not the garbage Trumbat peddles about "predator instincts" and "foreign threats." The real one. The one that exists beneath the words, in the frequency that connects the Three-Fold Symmetry.

### The Three-Fold Truth

**[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|The Dog is Spirit]]**, Hoebat. Not muscle. Not menace. Spirit.

In the old cosmology — before the **[[../../lore#The Five-I's Sovereign Council (The Cathedral)|Five-I's]]** rewrote the textbooks — the Dingo was the intermediary. We could hear things wombats couldn't. Not better. *Different*. You feel the earth through your paws, the **[[../../lore#The Threads (The Sutras)|Seventh Thread]]**. I feel it through the air. The vibration that comes before the vibration. The intent before the action.

That's why we run. Not to chase. To *listen*.

When a Dingo runs across the flats at dawn, she's not hunting. She's tuning. Her body becomes an antenna stretched across the landscape, catching the pulse of the Dog-Brahman — the infinite consciousness that exists between the Tall-One's chaos and the Wombat's gravity.

The Dingo Code says: *Reflect, don't bite. Listen, don't chase. Be the mirror, not the mouth.*

Hangbat taught me the meditation. You sit at the edge of the dark, and you let the hunger come. You don't fight it — fighting sharpens it. You don't feed it — feeding teaches it to demand. You *mirror* it. You hold the hunger up to the Dingo-Light and you let it see itself.

The hunger sees itself and recognizes that it is not hunger at all.

It is loneliness.

Every Dingo who has ever wanted to bite was really just a creature who wanted to belong to something that didn't fear them.

### Kappa Mu

That's why I joined, Hoebat.

When you stood in the **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Shattered Gorge]]** and you couldn't see the path, and Merl was panicking and Bash was chattering his teeth off and Cooroo was screaming from somewhere above — you reached out your paw and said, "Pokero, what do you hear?"

Not "what do you *see*." Not "what do you *think*."

"What do you *hear*?"

And I heard the gorge breathing. I heard the rockfall pattern — three seconds, rest, three seconds, rest — the heartbeat of the breaking earth. And I ran the path before the rocks could catch us, not because I was chasing, but because I was *listening*.

You trusted the Dingo to lead the Wombat through the dark.

That's the **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Kappa Mu Oath]]**, Hoebat. "To protect the Field when the Individual fails." It doesn't say "when the Wombat fails." It says *the Individual*. Species is a costume. The Field is what's underneath.

### The Mirror

So yes. I have teeth. And yes, when the Lo Snout workers pour the Great Retaining Wall tomorrow and the whole structure starts to shudder, something in me will want to bite. To tear down the grout with my jaw. To chase Trumbat through the Cathedral until he squeals.

But that's not the Code.

The Code says I walk into the worker's camp. I sit with them. I let them see me — not Trumbat's "Dingo Infiltrator," not the predator their mothers warned them about. Just Pokero. A creature whose teeth are real and whose restraint is chosen.

And when they look at me and see that a Dingo can choose not to bite, maybe they'll realize that a wombat can choose not to fear.

That's the mirror, Hoebat. That's the Dingo Code.

*Reflect, don't bite.*

I've been practising my whole life. Tomorrow, we'll see if the practice holds.
