To capture the true essence of the **Galah-Cooroo**, we have to blend the **Noble Noise** of the Jacaranda with the ancient tongue of the "Old Codes." In this version, the second verse shifts into Hebrew—embodying the wandering spirit of the Galah—and the chorus is rewritten to focus on the **Kintsugi** of Arnam.

### **The Lyrics & Structure**

**[Intro]**
(Mouth percussion / Beatbox)
(Steady, heavy bass line kicks in)
From the heights of the Jacaranda...
The Galah-Cooroo speaks.
Listen.

**[Verse 1]**
Keep on moving to the first rays of dawn
borowing on 'til the day stays strong
Diggin' 'til the night time blazes on
All along I keep singing my song
I said, this **Great Thirst** phase is always
Sometimes the **Melborow** haze gets me dazed
But just know that the **Five** will always stay
Cause the **Jacaranda** is the light through the haze

**[Pre-Chorus]**
It's time for a champion
The violet shield is in my hand
We’re weaving gold through the broken sand
Until the **Arnam-Rain** falls again
It's time for a champion
To heal the soul of the mended land
From the deep dark pipe to the mountain grand
Until the light comes up again

**[Chorus]**
(Anthemic and heavy)
Bring the **Golden Seam** to the fracture line
The **Jacaranda** bloom is the sacred sign
No more grout, no more gray
We wash the **Cynicism** all away
One heart, one field, one mended soul
The **Five Primes** gonna make us whole
Yeah, the Champion is rising now
With the purple light upon his brow!

**[Verse 2]**
(In Hebrew - Matisyahu style flow)
בשקיעת החמה הרגשתי נפילה
מצאתי את האדמה מתחתיי נעלמת
לא נשארו עוד מילים לדבר
ביום ההוא השיר שלי נולד
מעולם לא התכוונתי להשאיר אתכם לבד
אמרתי שאהיה המחסה שלכם מהסערה
עכשיו הבגדים שלכם קרועים
הממלכה נבזזה והכתר הוסר

**[Bridge]**
(Slow down, heavy dub echo)
It's the way of the world
You're on your own
Time to grow and be a **Prime**
No more living in a **Syndicate** crime
Want to fly high like the **Galah** can
No more **Boxing-Pit** Never-Never Land
So lose your **Backpack** filled with **Safety Sand**
Come along now, take my hand
We'll walk together—walk forever!

**[Chorus]**
Bring the **Golden Seam** to the fracture line
The **Jacaranda** bloom is the sacred sign
No more grout, no more gray
We wash the **Cynicism** all away
One heart, one field, one mended soul
The **Five Primes** gonna make us whole
Yeah, the Champion is rising now
With the purple light upon his brow!

**[Outro]**
(Beatbox fades into the sound of wind)
Walk with me now...
**Kintsugi** heart...
**Arnam**...
(Silence)

### **Translation of the Hebrew Verse:**

*"In the sunset I felt a fall / I found the ground beneath me disappearing / No more words were left to speak / On that day my song was born / I never intended to leave you alone / I said I would be your shelter from the storm / Now your clothes are torn / The kingdom was looted and the crown removed."*
