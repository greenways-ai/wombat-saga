# The Old Friends (The Fiveways Crew)

*The childhood companions of Hoebat, Scribat, and Rumbat. While Hoebat went underground, Rumbat went to the Council, and Scribat went to the server room, Duzbat and Flickbat chose the third path: they grew up, settled down, and tried to survive the "New Ways" by living inside them.*

## 🗿 Duzbat (The Anchor)

**"I don't dig for fun anymore. I dig for diapers."**

### I. The Archetype: The Silent Provider
Duzbat was once the unstoppable force of the outer ring, a wombat who dug because his body demanded it. Now, he is the **Atlas of Sector 7**. He carries the weight of a large family and a crushing mortgage in Vitabat's ledger. He represents the **Physical Toll** of the modern era—strength harvested for someone else's profit.

### II. Current Status
*   **Occupation:** Senior Load-Lifter at the Batch Seven Mixing Plant. He lifts the heavy sacks of calciumite that other wombats need machines to move.
*   **Family:** Married to a pragmatic nurse named **Tikkibat**. They have four joeys who eat more than a regiment of Dingoes.
*   **The Change:** The "New Ways" have exploited his nature. His massive claws, once tools of exploration, are now blunted instruments of labor. He is perpetually tired, his fur dusted with the grey powder of Safety Grout.

### III. Relationship to the Saga
*   **The Silent Accord:** He knows Hoebat is the "Shadow Architect." Duzbat doesn't say it, but he leaves the access panel to his sub-basement unlocked every Tuesday night, allowing Hoebat to bypass the Sector 7 checkpoints.
*   **The Conflict:** He loves Rumbat (now Trumbat's Foreman) like a brother, but he hates what Rumbat builds. When Rumbat visits for dinner, the silence between them is heavier than the grout they pour.

## 🕸️ Flickbat (The Stifled Ghost)

**"Don't look at the cracks, kids. Just paint over them."**

### I. The Archetype: The Caged Bird
Flickbat was the ghost who could fit through any gap, the spirit of agility and freedom. Now, she lives in a world where **"Safety" means "Sealed."** There are no gaps in the Great Retaining Wall. There are no cracks in the Frequency. She represents the **Psychological Toll**—the anxiety of a creature designed for freedom trapped in a grid.

### II. Current Status
*   **Occupation:** Quality Control Inspector for "Mural Harmony." She ensures that the distraction-murals covering the cracks are straight.
*   **Family:** Married to a nervous accountant. She has twin joeys whom she protects with a ferocity that borders on paranoia.
*   **The Change:** Her "competitive streak" has morphed into hyper-vigilance. She constantly checks the air vents, seals the windows, and obsessively monitors the Frequency, terrified that "The Yellow Monsters" will return. She can still fit into small spaces, but now she uses that skill to hide her children's unauthorized "Old Way" drawings from the inspectors.

### III. Relationship to the Saga
*   **The Memory:** She misses the "Root Cathedral" more than anyone. She keeps a piece of dried root from that cave hidden inside a hollowed-out "Safety Manual" on her shelf.
*   **The Fear:** She is terrified of Hoebat's rebellion. She begs him to stop, not because she disagrees, but because she has too much to lose. "You're still playing the game, Hoebat," she whispers. "The rest of us are just trying not to get deleted."
