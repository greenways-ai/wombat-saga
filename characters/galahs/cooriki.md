# Cooriki (The Silent Mother)

*   **Role:** Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony (Former).
*   **Location:** Perched on a scrubby Eucalyptus branch near the Wattle Stump.
*   **Status:** Silent. Depressed.

## Motivation
Cooriki is not motivated by grand metaphysics or the failure of the "Acoustic Covenant." Her grief is simpler and deeper:
*   **Loss of Community:** She misses the **Rosellas**. They were her neighbors and friends. Their Song was the background noise of her life, and now the Ridge is quiet.
*   **Loss of Home:** She grew up in the lower branches of the Great Wattle. It wasn't a "Coring Tree" to her; it was her living room. Its fall is the destruction of her personal history.
*   **Loyalty:** She stayed when the others fled not because she had a sacred duty, but because she couldn't imagine being anywhere else. Now she is the last one left at a party that ended weeks ago.

## Relationship with Cooroo
She loves him but finds him baffling. She sees his inability to scream as a symptom of the broken world. When he finally screams the "New Noise" (the Violet Scream), she turns her head not because she understands the prophecy, but because for the first time in weeks, the silence of the Ridge is broken by something that sounds like **Life**.
