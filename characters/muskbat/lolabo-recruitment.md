# The Algorithm of Desire: Lolaboo’s Recruitment

*A memory shared by [[../../characters#Lolaboo (The Catalyst)|Lolaboo]] to [[../../characters#Hoebat|Hoebat]] during the long rains.*

***

You look at me, Hoebat, with that dirt on your snout and you think I was always this... grounded. You think I was born hating The Cathedral. But I wasn't. I was curated, Hoebat. I was optimized.

Before I met you in the mud, I was a candidate for the **Golden Vessel**.

It started three years ago. I wasn’t digging tunnels then; I was scrubbing them. I was a junior polisher in the Upper Atrium, making sure the marble reflected the "Dingo-Light" just right. That’s when *He* saw me. Not with eyes, Hoebat. He saw me through a lens.

**Muskbat**.

He didn't walk up to me. He hovered. He had that silver-furred belly that looked like it had never touched soil. He twitched his nose—three sharp clicks, left-right-left.

"Your oscillation," he said. His voice wasn't a growl; it was a hum. Like a high-tension wire. "It’s perfect."

I stopped scrubbing. "My what?"

"Your oscillation," he repeated, tapping a glass tablet. "The way you scrub. The rhythm. It’s entirely inefficient for cleaning, but it matches the **[[../../lore#The Melborow Frequency|Melborow Frequency]]** within a margin of 0.04%."

He didn't ask me out. He asked me to **scale**.

### The Frequency Dancers

That’s how I became a **Frequency Dancer**. You’ve seen them on the screens, Hoebat. The "Interpretive Nodes." The beautiful wombats in The Cathedral who twitch and spin to the "music" of the Humans. They tell the poor diggers down below that if we just dance correctly, if we just align our chakras with the Wi-Fi signals, the **[[../../lore#The Cosmic Framework: The Tall-Ones|Tall-Ones]]** will spare us.

It was the most coveted job in Melborow.

The pros? The *Pros* were intoxicating.
*   **The Food:** Premium Roots, Hoebat. Roots that had been washed three times. Truffles imported from the "Green Zone."
*   **The Status:** I walked into the Atrium and High-Noses bowed. I was "The Signal." I wasn't just a wombat; I was an Interface.
*   **The Safety:** Or the illusion of it. While the Gray Grotto crumbled, we had air filters. We had "Seismic Dampeners."

But the cons... the cons were invisible until you were inside. It was a cage of mirrors. We weren't allowed to dig. "Digging disrupts the signal," Muskbat would say. We had to keep our claws filed smooth, useless. A wombat without claws is just a hamster, Hoebat.

### The Competitive Index

And the girls. By the Great Root, the girls.

There were twelve of us. The "Selected." And it wasn't a sisterhood. It was a gladiatorial pit, but instead of teeth, we used Metrics.

There was **She-Ra**, a blonde-furred wombat from the West Ridge. She spent four hours a day grooming her nose until it was reflective enough to signal aircraft. She’d look at me and say, "Lolaboo, your fur is looking a bit... matte today. Are you dehydrated? It lowers your broadcast range."

They competed on everything:
*   **Glitch-Aesthetics:** Who could twitch the most convincingly when the "Signal" dropped?
*   **Calorie-Optimization:** Who could eat the least while still looking "fertile yet futuristic"?
*   **Muskbat’s Favor:** They tracked his eye movements. "He looked at my Sector for 12 seconds," She-Ra would brag. "He’s thinking of integrating me into the Core Processor."

They would sabotage each other. I once found my "Dancing Harness" loosened. If I had worn it during the Morning Broadcast, I would have tripped and been "De-Platformed" immediately.

### The Seduction of Structure

But I survived. Because Muskbat liked me. And that... that was the strangest part.

You know how wombats court, Hoebat. The chase. The bite. The **[[../../lore#The Old Ways (The Fixed Borow)|Old Way Dance]]** where you shake the earth to prove you can hold a roof up.

Muskbat didn't bite. He *explained*.

He seduced me with **[[../../lore#The Threads (The Sutras)|Section 9.1: Morphisms]]**.

He took me to his private chamber—the "Observatory." There were no windows, just screens. Screens showing the digging sites, the stock markets, the heat signatures of every borow in Melborow.

"Look at the chaos, Lolaboo," he whispered, pointing to the messy, organic tunnels of the poor. "Inefficient. Redundant. They dig because they are afraid. But we..."

He moved closer. He smelled like ozone and sanitized lavender.

"We can architect a solution. I don't need a mate, Lolaboo. I need a *Co-Variable*."

He showed me his blueprints. Not for a borow, but for a **Society**. A diagram where every wombat was a dot, and lines connected us all in a perfect, rigid grid.
"I chose you," he said, "because your genetic code suggests a high tolerance for... abstraction. You don't crave the dirt, do you?"

He leaned in, his nose brushing my ear. "Join me. We can upload the consciousness of Melborow. We can bypass the mud entirely. We can live in the Cloud."

For a moment, Hoebat... just a moment... I was mesmerized. It was so clean. So simple. No fear of collapse. No dirt under the fingernails. Just pure, white logic.

But then I looked at the blueprint again.

I looked at the "dots."
"Where are the sleeping chambers?" I asked.
"Irrelevant," he said. "Sleep is downtime."
"Where are the nurseries?"
"Outsourced."
"Where is the *dirt*?"

He laughed. A dry, clicking sound. "Lolaboo, my dear. The dirt is the enemy. The dirt is what buries us."

That’s when I felt it. The coldness.

He didn't want a partner. He wanted a mirror. He wanted a wombat who would reflect his own genius back at him until he felt like a god.

I looked at his silver belly. I looked at his smooth, useless claws. And I remembered my grandmother. I remembered the **[[../../lore#The Threads (The Sutras)|Seventh Thread]]**. *Experience is Mother.*

"I can't dance to silence, Muskbat," I said.

He looked confused. "The Frequency is everywhere."

"No," I said. "The Frequency is a hum. But it has no heartbeat."

I walked out. I left the Truffles. I left the Air Filters. I left She-Ra polishing her nose in the hallway.

I went down to the marketplace. I got mud on my paws. I felt the panic of the city, the real, sweating, fearful panic. And then... I saw you.

You were grifting that old dowager. You were lying through your teeth. You were dirty, and cynical, and your "Ruby" was a piece of red glass.

But when you looked at me... when you dropped the con and stomped your foot... the ground *shook*.

Muskbat offered me the Cloud, Hoebat.
But you offered me the Earth.

And I’d rather be buried in the truth than float in a lie.
