Here's something they don't tell you about saving the world: it involves a lot of physical exertion.

"Apparently 'bearing the memory of an ancient god-tree across a heart-shaped world to graft onto a foreign sapling' still requires cardio. Who knew."

"My wings, I should mention, are still too short. This is a juvenile thing."

"But saviours don't get proper goodbyes. They get jumped-off-stumps with wilting vines and the vague hope that their mothers might notice they're gone."

"The resonance in my skull chambers pulled me southeast like a compass needle, a deep, internal wrongness that grew the longer I stood still."

"The vine broadcast **Súlë Arnan**—the Breath of Chaos. This was messy, chaotic, resonance-driven flight, broadcasting a Fractal Signal that screamed 'Chaos' in a world going digital."

"Subject eliminated due to Raca (Broken Air) in Axan-Vilya (Law-Wind Air)."

"You're... offering me a ride?"

"Get on. Or don't. I don't care. But decide, because I have spirals to run."

"Get on or get eaten by Wedgies. I have no preference. But the window for decision-making is closing."

"The Walker had a rider. In the history of the Southern Shell, in all the scrolls and songs and silent traditions that the Emus maintained without ever writing down, no Emu had ever allowed a rider. It was a fundamental breach of the Code."

"I'm going to remember this! When I tell the story, you're going to be in it! A hero! An Emu who —"

"They [Wedgies] fly in 'Glass-Air' — that's what the old lexicon calls the high Law-Wind — tiled air that carries them like they own it."

"The Jacaranda was a heresy against the foundational logic of the Great Disconnection, a living break in the Structural Rigidity itself."

"The Jacaranda was different. It didn't go deep. It spread **wide** — shallow, lateral, fractal. Its roots floated on the surface of the Static like a raft, touching a thousand weak signals instead of one strong poisoned one."

"*You are not here to fix the Song, Cooroo,* the tree vibrated. *You are here to scream the Truth.*"

"*The map stops here. But the world doesn't.*"

"I wasn't here to fix the Chorus. I was here to assemble the Kappa Mu."

"Wombat. Emu. Dingo. Wallaby. Galah."

"Tomorrow, I would scream again. Tomorrow, I would find the others. Tomorrow, the Kappa Mu would begin."
