"Here's something that shouldn't be possible: a Galah who can't scream."

"Galahs scream. That's the whole deal... We scream the way the sun comes up: every day, no apologies, and usually before anyone's ready for it."

"The Noble Noise goes out as sound. It comes back as data. That's the deal. That's the covenant between a Galah and the world: you give it noise, it gives you knowledge."

"Hún Nico (Heart of Nico) — that's what we call it, the Heart of Nico — is a heart. Not a metaphor."

"When they care, the pulse is strong. When they forget, it gutters."

"The problem is that it's coming up."

"The Static — that's what they call it, the creeping crystallisation — is pushing the deep geometry toward the surface, replacing topsoil with lattice, turning the living layer into the dead layer."

"When the crystal shows up on the surface, it means the organic layer has failed — the skin has thinned, and the bone is showing through."

"Perfection had won, and I was standing in the wreckage counting angles while my mother went catatonic on a branch."

"The Noble Noise has no return. It just goes."

"The Rosellas had a covenant. Covenants break. We're just here because we're here. You can't break that."

"We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we."

"The sound. That's the bit I can't escape... The Snap. The moment when the organic finally lost to the geometric. And my voice went quiet too."

"The map is not finished."

"It was a direction. South-east. Far... Somewhere out there — somewhere on the curving inner surface of Hún Nico (Heart of Nico)... the lattice was thin and the ground still held moisture... still growing. Not a Wattle. A Jacaranda."

"I was done arguing with my feathers."

"The sky survives concentration. It just comes out a different colour."

"It was terrible. The worst scream in the history of Galah screaming — raw, cracked, graceless, a gate hinge in a cyclone... It was also the first sound I'd made in five weeks."

"Small things are how big things start. A crack is how a vine gets in. A hum is how a scream comes back. A seed is how a tree begins."

"The Rosellas had the covenant. The Galahs had nothing but volume and a refusal to leave. It was enough."
