"There is a kind of condensation that doesn't fall. It arrives. It takes up residence in the air the way grief takes up residence in the body — not descending from above but materialising from within, as though the atmosphere itself had remembered something unbearable and begun to weep."

"Rain that doesn't clean the city so much as reveal it, the way a wet cloth reveals the grain of wood that polish has been hiding."

"The Council calls this 'perimeter redistribution.' The Lo Snouts call it drowning."

"The bureaucratic poetry of planned abandonment. Let the periphery decay. Focus resources on the Cathedral. On the projects that look good in reports."

"Each sign a word in a sentence the place is writing about its own death."

"The hum dies... The Melborow Frequency — that constant, low-grade thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment — cuts out... Like the last note of a song you didn't know you were listening to until it stopped."

"There is a quality to silence in underground places that surface creatures never know. It has mass. It has temperature. It presses against your fur like water, fills your ears like clay..."

"Lost Dingoes. Scavengers. The ones who fell out of the Pack structure, who only know hunger and desperation. They are what happens when a creature's covenant with the world breaks down and nothing fills the gap — not code, not instinct, not belonging. Just appetite."

"Wombats don't fight. We endure. We hold weight until weight becomes architecture. We stand beneath collapsing ceilings and wait for the physics to notice we haven't moved."

"Dingo culture isn't about territory, digger. Not really. It's about flow state. You think we're just killers? Any idiot can rip a throat out. That's messy. That's low-frequency... It's inefficient."

"He picked up a stick, drew three lines in the dust between us. '3-7-5. That's the rythm.' He snapped the stick. 'That's where the flow lives. That's where you find out who you really are when the structure pins you down.'"

"That was the moment I knew. Not when we swore the brother's oath together... That night... that was when I knew Pokero was my friend."

"The Code hits them like a physical thing."

"He looks different in the city. Harder. Sharper. But the eyes — golden, patient as held breath — those are the same eyes that watched me fumble Dingo vowels by the campfire."

"That Wall isn't for keeping things out. It's for keeping you *in*. It's a lid for a coffin."

"This place is Dead Tissue. Section 3.1, if you're keeping score. The spirit's already left the body. My kind are just the maggots. We hunt here because there's nothing left to damage."

"The Council thinks the world is math. The Dingos know better. The world is a song. And when you get the rhythm wrong, it eats you."

"This isn't a friendly check-in; it's an activation. A signal that the game has moved to a new, more dangerous phase."

"Pokero didn't just give me advice. He gave me a key and a lock. He took our old private language and upgraded it from philosophy to espionage."

"And Pokero — my friend, my brother in the Kappa Mu, the operative sitting in the room with the morticians—is defining the battlefield. With classic Dingo misdirection, he's telling me that to find him, I have to go right into the pack."
