# Option 3 (Revised): The Jumbled Inheritance (Cornelibat's Bedtime Story)

## I. The Narrative Frame

**The Central Conflict:** **Truth vs. Translation.**
The "Old Ways" are not just being suppressed; they are being forgotten. Cornelibat holds the fragments, but he can no longer piece them together correctly.

**The Theme:** **The Seed in the Static.**
Hoebat’s "Dream" of Kappa Mu isn't something he invents; it's something he *remembers* from the garbled stories of his childhood. The "Prophecy" is a puzzle he has been solving since he was a joey.

**The Arc of Cornelibat:**
1.  **The Keeper (Flashback):** A father trying to pass on the weight of the world to his son before the "Static" takes his mind.
2.  **The Exile (Present):** A ghost of a wombat who lives in the "Deep-Deep," having lost the ability to tell the difference between the dream and the grout.

## II. The Entry Point: "The Song of the Square Hole"

**Setting:** A deep, ancestral burrow, decades before the Great Calcification. The air is thick with the scent of damp loam and the musk of a family that hasn't seen the surface in generations—a smell that is equal parts comfort and carbon dioxide. A single, bioluminescent glow-worm provides a flickering, emerald light, acting as the only operating lumen in the sector.

### Chapter 1: The Misplaced Purple

"And then," Cornelibat whispered, his voice sounding like the grinding of two flat stones that had been arguing for centuries, "the Kangaroo King put on his sneakers—size twelve, high-tops—and hopped into the Nico Star."

Young Hoebat blinked his large, dark eyes. He was tucked into a bed of soft eucalyptus bark that smelled of sleep and history, his paws still twitching from a day of learning to pack soil. "Dad? Kangaroos don't have sneakers. Their metatarsals are elongated for elastic recoil. And what's a Nico Star?"

Cornelibat paused, squinting at an ancient bark-scroll that was so worn the etchings looked less like writing and more like the tracks of a confused beetle trying to escape a very slow predator. "Don't interrupt the logic, joey. It's a Prophecy. It's supposed to be difficult. The Nico Star is... well, it’s a giant glowing rectangle where the Tall-Ones keep the Arnam. Or maybe it’s a giant dingo made of light. The archival data is corrupt."

Hoebat frowned, his nose wrinkling. "What about the Koalas? Did they find the Wattle?"

"The Koalas," Cornelibat sighed, leaning back against the cool clay wall which seemed to absorb his exhaustion, "became librarians for the Galahs. Or was it the other way around? The scroll says the 'Lyptus Gang' traded the golden blossoms for a subscription to the Frequency. But that can't be right. We don't have subscriptions yet. That's a 'New Way' word. An imported concept."

Cornelibat shook his head, his heavy claws tracing a faded drawing of a tree that looked suspiciously like a Jacaranda, but he was holding the scroll upside down, effectively reversing the polarity of the myth.

"Listen, Hoebat. This is the important part. The part about the **Broken Circle**. The Prophecy says that when the world turns square, the ground will start to scream. It won't be a loud scream. It will be a low-frequency vibration—around 4 Hertz—that rattles the teeth of the young."

"The Fiveways?" Hoebat asked, sleepy now, his eyelids heavy. "Like the intersection at Sector 4 where the drainage keeps backing up?"

"No, no. The *creatures*. The bird that can't fly, the dog that can't bark, the eucalypt that isn't green, and... and a wombat who forgets how to dig four feet deep."

Hoebat’s eyes snapped open. "Forget how to dig? That's impossible, Dad. Digging is who we are. It’s a biological imperative."

"That’s why it’s a Prophecy, son," Cornelibat said, his voice suddenly losing its jumbled rhythm and becoming terrifyingly clear, like a radio signal suddenly locking onto a station. "One day, the Tall-Ones will give us a hole that is already dug. They will give us a hole with right angles and air-conditioning and a monthly maintenance fee. And we will be so tired of the weight of the roof that we will say 'thank you.' And that, Hoebat, is when the Wombat heart stops beating. That is the moment of cardiac arrest for the species."

Cornelibat rolled up the scroll, his paws trembling slightly—a fine motor tremor indicative of long-term exposure to stress. "But the story says the Architect will come. He won't build a better wall. He’ll build a **Kappa Mu**."

"What's a Kappa Mu, Dad?"

Cornelibat looked at the ceiling, at the roots that were still healthy and wet, pumping nutrients down from a world that hadn't yet been paved. "I don't know, joey. I think... I think it’s a bridge made of gold. Or maybe it’s just a way to keep the soil wet when the rain stops falling from the sky. A hydraulic bypass for the soul."

He leaned down and licked the top of Hoebat’s head. "Go to sleep. Dream of the purple. Don't let the grout get into your ears."

Hoebat closed his eyes. That night, he didn't dream of the Fixed Borow. He dreamed of a giant, glowing rectangle, a pink bird diving into a storm, and a gold-colored trowel that could mend the very fabric of the world.

### III. Why This Works

1.  **It Establishes the "Kintsugi" Narrative:** The story itself is "broken" (jumbled), and Hoebat’s task is to "mend" the prophecy with his own experience.
2.  **It Sets Up the Antagonists:** Cornelibat’s warning about "pre-dug holes" perfectly foreshadows the Sovereigns' control.
3.  **It Humanizes Hoebat:** We see him as a joey, absorbing the myths that will later drive his rebellion.
4.  **It Explains the Jargon:** It introduces terms like "Kappa Mu," "Nico Star," and "The Frequency" through the lens of a confused but well-meaning father.
