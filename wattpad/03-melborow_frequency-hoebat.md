# The Melborow Frequency

## Chapter 1: The Load

There is a kind of rain that doesn't fall. It arrives. It takes up residence in the air the way grief takes up residence in the body — not descending from above but materialising from within, as though the atmosphere itself had remembered something unbearable and begun to weep.

The rain in Melborow is that kind.

Gray, heavy, carrying the taste of rust and neglected drainage from the heights of Queensborow to pool in the alleys of the Gray Grotto. It finds every crack where the Grout has failed, every wound the High-Noses left unattended, every seam in the concrete that the Council pretends doesn't exist. It is the city's own sweat. Melborow perspiring through its infrastructure, leaking through its skin, confessing through its pores what its ledgers refuse to admit: that something underneath has gone terribly wrong.

I don't mind rain. Not usually. Rain means the Grout swells. Swelling Grout means work, and work means I can feel the earth through my paws, which is the only honest conversation left in this city. But this rain — this oily, persistent drizzle — feels different. Heavier. Rain as atmosphere. Rain as diagnosis. Rain that doesn't clean the city so much as reveal it, the way a wet cloth reveals the grain of wood that polish has been hiding.

The grain of the Gray Grotto is abandonment.

"Signal's weak," Lolaboo mutters. Her claw taps the BorowFinder app, that blue glow painting her fur in Council-approved colours. She looks like a creature from a different world — which she is. Queensborow. Upper levels. The kind of wombat who still believes the Frequency is singing to her, not at her. "Seventy meters. Almost there."

Seventy meters. In daylight, with the Frequency humming and the streetlights working, that's nothing. A commute. A stroll through someone else's geography. But the lights in this district stopped working six months ago. Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code: Temporal Cropping. A beautiful phrase, that. The bureaucratic poetry of planned abandonment. Let the periphery decay. Focus resources on the Cathedral. On the projects that look good in reports.

Above us, the Glow-Panels flicker in the distance—the ones that still work. They're Muskbat's innovation: bioluminescent tiles powered by the Frequency itself, broadcasting as they illuminate, singing the Melborow hymn in visible light.

Three levels down, the **Deep Sewer** hums—not a wombat dig but a Council excavation, bored through bedrock with drills and lined with **Safety Grout**. The High-Noses ride the **Sump Line** in climate-controlled pods, buffered from the substrate's vibration, ferried between the Cathedral and Queensborow on rails bolted into the **tunnel crown**. I helped install the first **weep lines** that fed the Frequency cables through the **service chase** running parallel to the main flow. I remember when we called it progress.

The Deep Sewer was supposed to be **dual-purpose**: transit below, **storm management** above. But the **collection sumps** clog with silt the Council never budgets to clear, and the **relief drains**—those emergency overflows meant to protect the lower borows—were capped to make room for more **utility conduits**. When the rains come hard, the water has nowhere to go but through the **seepage walls** into the **unlined tunnels** where the Lo Snouts live. The Council calls this "perimeter redistribution." The Lo Snouts call it drowning.

"They call it 'up-and-coming,'" Lolaboo says, her paw tightening around mine. She wants to believe the marketing. We both do. "Emerging district with character."

I look down the alley. My eyes adjusted hours ago, compensating for missing photons, reading the texture of dark. This is the thing about underground creatures — our eyes don't just see. They listen. They feel. They read the architecture of absence the way a blind wombat reads a tunnel wall with his whiskers. I see what her app can't show: the sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down, the hairline fracture in the Grout where water pools, the faint luminescence of Static colonisation in the foundation cracks. Each sign a word in a sentence the city is writing about its own death.

The Council calls them "transitioning neighbourhoods." "Development-pending areas." But I know the signs the way you know the signs in a body — not from the textbook but from the hands. From years of pressing your paws against substrate and feeling whether it wants to hold or whether the will has gone out of it. The smashed streetlights aren't vandalism. They're policy. Slow withdrawal of services designed to make residents leave voluntarily, so the Council won't have to pay for relocation when the inevitable happens.

---

The hum dies.

Not the rain. The rain keeps falling, indifferent. But the Melborow Frequency — that constant, low-grade thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment — cuts out. The digital infrastructure, the networked lights, the comforting buzz of connectivity: all of it, gone. Like a hand withdrawing from a cheek. Like the last note of a song you didn't know you were listening to until it stopped.

Lolaboo's app dies. The blue light vanishes. We stand in absolute dark, two shapes under a rusted awning, listening to rain and silence.

There is a quality to silence in underground places that surface creatures never know. It has mass. It has temperature. It presses against your fur like water, fills your ears like clay, and in the space where the Frequency used to be you can hear — if you are very still, if you have spent decades pressing your paws into earth — the actual voice of the ground. The deep, slow, geological murmur of substrate shifting against substrate. The real frequency. The one the Council's broadcast was designed to drown out.

"Hoebat?" Her voice is small.

"Don't move," I say.

I don't say *don't make a sound*. Sound doesn't matter anymore. Whatever's out there isn't hunting by noise. It's hunting by smell. By heat. By the chemical signature of those who wandered too far from the upper levels.

From the storm drain they come. Three shapes. Lean, rib-thin, moving with jagged grace. Lost Dingoes. Scavengers. The ones who fell out of the Pack structure, who only know hunger and desperation. They are what happens when a creature's covenant with the world breaks down and nothing fills the gap — not code, not instinct, not belonging. Just appetite. That's what a Lost Dingo is. The reflection that escaped. The hunger that used to serve a purpose now serving only itself.

They circle. Eyes catching distant trash-fire light, reflecting gold on black. Predator optics.

Lolaboo presses against my flank. I feel her trembling. I feel something else too: the heat of her fear changing the air between us, creating a micro-climate of panic that the Dingoes read like a map. Fear has a geography. It flows downhill. It pools in the lowest place. Right now, the lowest place is us.

"Hoebat," she whispers. "They're going to—"

"Stay still."

My voice is gravel. Low. Almost subsonic. It is not a fighting voice. Wombats don't fight. We endure. We hold weight until weight becomes architecture. We stand beneath collapsing ceilings and wait for the physics to notice we haven't moved.

Instead of reaching for a weapon, I remember.

---

By the third night of our survival mission, we'd run out of things to guard against. The Lambda class had scattered us across the dry plains with nothing but a waterskin and the instruction to "maintain composure," which meant different things depending on whether you were a Dingo or a wombat. For Pokero, it meant not hunting the Wallaby pair we'd heard crying in the dark three klicks east. For me, it meant not digging a hole and hiding in it until the sun came back.

We were the only two left in our assigned sector. The others had either found their way back to base or become statistics. Pokero and I just... stayed. We'd been squadmates long enough to know each other's rhythms—he'd learned that I dug when I was nervous; I'd learned that he went silent when he was hunting, and he only went *really* silent when he was teaching.

The fire was down to embers. The jerky was gone. And Pokero—who'd been staring at the stars for an hour without speaking—suddenly said: "You know why Dingoes like Haikus?"

"Because fifteen syllables is the exact length of your attention span?"

He didn't bark-laugh. He just smiled, one side of his mouth curling up like a dry leaf catching fire. "We compress our ideas into compact rhythms," he said. "Vibes. We're all about vibes. And Haikus are like little crystal vibes that we jab at each other with."

He turned to face me fully then, the firelight catching the scar above his eye—a souvenir from some dominance dispute he'd never told me about. "You want to learn the Code? Real Code? Then we play the battle game. I insult you in fifteen syllables. You insult me back. Whoever flinches first loses."

"Sounds like a great way to start a fight."

"It *is* a fight," he said. "Just compressed. Now listen."

He settled back onto his haunches, and his voice dropped into something almost like a chant—hip-hop rhythm without the beat, words flowing into each other like water finding cracks in stone.

"Dingo culture isn't about territory, digger. Not really. It's about flow state. The Pack runs in patterns that never repeat—that's the kinetic truth. But when we stop running, when we sit around the fire like this, we make the patterns with words. Numerology. Vibration. Everything coming together in syllable counts."

He paused, eyes half-closed, feeling the shape of what he was trying to say.

"We mostly speak Quenya—the old tongue. The Pack-Talk. It's precise. Every sound carries weight. But beauty..." He opened his eyes, looked at me. "Beauty can be found in the common tongue too. The crude words. The rough sounds. There's a truth in the dirt that the polished stones don't have."

He picked up a stick, drew three lines in the dust between us.

"Five syllables. Seven syllables. Five syllables. That's the cage. But inside the cage—" He snapped the stick. "—that's where the flow lives. That's where you find out who you really are when the structure pins you down."

"It's a battle of composure when two Dingoes joust," he said. "Who breaks first. Who flinches. Who lets the silence beat them."

He turned then, those too-sharp teeth glinting. "Your move, digger."

That was the moment I knew. Not when we swore the Kappa Mu Oath together. Not when we navigated the Shattered Gorge blind. That night, with the dry plains pressing around us like a held breath and every pause between us filled with cricket-song and the far-off howl of a Pack running its circuit, his golden eyes catching firelight the way the scrub catches dawn—reluctantly, as if illumination were a concession to vulnerability—that was when I knew Pokero was my friend.

Dingoes don't have friends. They have pack-mates, rivals, prey, and teachers. But Pokero had just handed me a weapon and shown me how to sharpen it. He'd made himself vulnerable by explaining his own culture, his own flow state, to a creature who had every reason to misunderstand it. That was the gift. That was the trust.

We were playing the Haiku game—who can say the most with the least.

Pokero went first. His voice dropped into that hip-hop cadence, each syllable a little knife:

> *Feet stink bad.*
> *Feet smell of death and decay.*
> *Rotting inside out.*

I felt my ears go flat. The insult landed—not just the words, but the rhythm, the precision. Three syllables like a jab, seven like a hook, five like a body shot.

I thought for three slow breaths. The fire crackled. Somewhere in the dark, a night-bird screamed.

> *Wolf got shanked.*
> *Your ancestor met sharp teeth.*
> *Hood up. Wolf down. Dead.*

Pokero's ears swiveled forward. One heartbeat. Two. Then he bark-laughed—loud enough to spook something in the scrub, loud enough that I knew I'd won the round.

"Not bad, digger," he said. "Not bad at all."

But he wasn't done. Pokero stretched his legs out, crossed his paws, and grinned with all his teeth.

> *Count your friends.*
> *I have eaten more wombats.*
> *You have zero friends.*

The fire popped. I stared at him. Zero was exactly right—I was the weirdo in Lambda class, the one who dug holes when he was nervous and talked to soil. Pokero knew exactly where to put the blade.

I felt my throat tighten, then remembered: this was a battle of composure. I let the silence stretch. Three seconds. Four. Then:

> *Choke it down.*
> *Wombat penis fills your throat.*
> *Swallow it all, dog.*

Pokero froze. His ears went flat, then forward, then flat again. For one terrible moment I thought I'd gone too far—crossed some line where the game became war. Then he threw his head back and howled—actually howled, a long note that carried across the dry plains and probably woke every creature within three klicks.

"Okay," he said when he got his breath back. "Okay. You got me. You actually got me."

He stood up, walked around the fire, and sat down right next to me—close enough that I could smell the wild on him, the territory-marking musk that Council-wombats spent fortunes trying to wash off.

"Tomorrow," he said, "I teach you the Code. The real Code. Not this game—"

"I thought this was the real Code."

"This is the playground. The Code is what keeps you alive when the Scavengers come. When your Frequency dies and your mate is trembling against your flank and you have nothing but your voice."

He looked at me then, and there was no grin in it. "You learn the Code, digger. You learn it because someday you'll need to speak for both of us."

I didn't understand what he meant. Not then. Not until years later, in the Gray Grotto, when his voice came out of the darkness and the Lost Dingoes scattered like smoke.

*Who can say the most with the least?*

The dry plains weren't a setting for our conversation — they were the conversation. Every pause between us filled with cricket-song and the far-off howl of a Pack running its circuit. Pokero's golden eyes catching firelight the way the scrub catches dawn: reluctantly, as if illumination were a concession to vulnerability.

He taught me things in those nights. Not friendship — Dingoes don't offer that. But exchange. Survival packaged in protocol. The Secret Code. *Click-clack, hiss, pause.* The Watcher's Frequency. A rhythmic pattern that says to any Dingo within earshot: *I am not prey. I am recognised. I carry knowledge that the Pack considers worth preserving.*

Uncle Hangbat had given me the basics. Pokero gave me the grammar.

*"The bone is dry,"* he'd correct me, adjusting my accent the way I'd adjust a fracture line in substrate. *"Not 'drai.' Dry. Like the ground when it's stopped trying. The Dingo-Tongue doesn't describe things. It diagnoses them."*

Between the language lessons, there were the verses. The Haiku game ran alongside everything else — a parallel conversation, compressed, where we said the things that plain talk couldn't carry. One night, the fire down to embers, Pokero tossed me a haiku about wombats. Dismissive. Precise. The way Dingoes see us:

> *Fat paws press dead ground,*
> *Blind roots choke on their own depth,*
> *Stones that call it home.*

I turned it over for three days. Paced the scrub. Felt the shape of the insult, the accuracy of it, the way a good diagnosis hurts because it's true. Then I gave him my answer:

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

He didn't say anything for a long time. The embers shifted. A night-bird called from somewhere that wasn't on any map. Then: "Not bad, for a digger."

That was the highest compliment a Dingo gives. We never spoke those verses to anyone else. They were ours — a private frequency, fifteen syllables each, passed across the species line like a secret handshake made of breath. Two creatures who had no business understanding each other, proving they did.

---

The lead Scavenger lunges. Scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. He doesn't see me. He sees prey. Soft flesh. Easy calories. The Queensborow smell of soap and safety.

I drop my centre of gravity. Find purchase on wet concrete. Square my shoulders. Symmetry. Section 8.2. The posture that says: *I am load-bearing. I am not moving. You cannot push me, pull me, make me yield.*

From my throat, I make a sound.

*Click-clack, hiss, pause.*

The Watcher's Frequency.

Then the words. Dingo-Tongue. Harsh vowels scraping my throat like gravel being swallowed:

*"The bone is dry. The marrow is gone. I am the Living Root, not the Dead Branch."*

The Scavenger freezes. Three meters away. Close enough to smell his breath — rot and desperation. But his ears swivel. The Code hits him like a physical thing, penetrating the Static-haze, triggering something older than hunger.

Recognition. Fear. Not of me. Of what I represent.

From deeper dark, a fourth shape moves. Larger. Composed. Not hungry — *present*.

Pokero steps into the firelight.

He looks different in the city. Harder. Sharper. The country dust washed off, replaced by Melborow grime. But the eyes — golden, patient as held breath — those are the same eyes that watched me fumble Dingo vowels by the campfire. The same eyes that saw something in a wombat worth teaching.

He doesn't bark. Doesn't growl. One sharp yelp. Command. Dismissal.

The Scavengers scatter like smoke finding better opportunities.

"You always did have a big mouth, Hoebat," Pokero says. His voice is smoke and gravel. Someone who's been screaming into the Static for years and learned to make it sound like conversation. "What brings a Root-Digger to my graveyard?"

"Looking for a home. Thought the Council sold honest burrows."

"The Council sells lies with good lighting." He glances at Lolaboo. "Your female doesn't know the Code."

"She knows enough," I say. "She's my mate."

"Same difference. Both smell like Queensborow. Both think the Frequency will save them."

He turns toward the Wall — Trum-Bat's endless concrete ribbon, bisecting the horizon like a scar the city gave itself on purpose.

"The Wall won't stop what's coming. Walls just make the abandonment fester. Trap it inside with the living."

"I'm not buying in the Grotto," I say.

"Good. This place is Dead Tissue. Section 3.1, if you're keeping score. The spirit's already left the body. My kind hunt here because there's nothing left to damage."

He steps closer. Close enough to smell — wild, ungroomed, the scent of territories that don't appear on maps. The scent of a creature who still belongs to the earth: not as a native, not as a conqueror, but as a body that had finally stopped resisting the landscape it was standing in.

He glances at Lolaboo, then back to me. "Keep her close. The Soft-Paws who wander alone don't wander long."

"If you want a hole that won't cave in," he says, voice dropping to a whisper, "look where the Dingoes *don't* hunt. We only go where the spirit has already left. Find the places we avoid. That's where the soil still remembers how to hold."

Then he's gone. Back into rain. Into dark. Into the frequency only his kind can hear.

The lights flicker back on. Sickly yellow. The Frequency returns — that electronic hum telling us everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations crumbling.

Lolaboo's app reboots. Cheerful chime. Seventy meters to property. Great investment opportunity.

"How did you do that?" she breathes.

I adjust my pack. Feel the weight of tools. The trowel. The gold dust. The clay. The things that matter when power dies and lights go out.

"The High-Noses teach us the world is math," I say. "Add this Grout, subtract that load, multiply by safety factors. But the Dingoes know better. They know it's a song. And songs have rules. Patterns. If you forget the lyrics — if you stop paying attention to the rhythm — they eat you."

I look down the alley. At the sagging roof. At the Static-laced foundations. At the Dead Zone the Council pretends doesn't exist.

"We aren't buying here, Lolaboo. This is Dead Tissue. The soil stopped breathing months ago."

"But the listing — the app said—"

"The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies." I start walking, heavy paws splashing through stagnant puddles. "If you want to survive in Melborow, you learn to listen to what the world says when the power's off. You learn to hear the silence. That's where the truth lives."

She follows. Of course she does. They always do, eventually.

## Chapter 2: The Fire and the Verse

Years pass. The Static rises. The Council builds higher, digs deeper, calculates more precisely, misses more completely.

But before the failure, before the shadows, before the weight of the roof settled onto my shoulders alone — there was the Root Chamber. There was the Assembly.

I need to tell this part carefully, because it is the hinge on which everything turns, and hinges, if you don't oil them, if you don't pay attention to the small mechanical truth of how they work, will seize up and hold you on whichever side you happened to be standing when the rust set in.

I found them. Or they found me. Or the Jacaranda — that impossible violet tree growing in soil it had no business growing in — drew us together the way a root draws water: not by force but by need, by the physics of thirst, by the simple fact that dry things move toward wet things if you give them long enough.

Cooroo. The screaming bird with his Noble Noise, who'd carried a dying vine across the world because a flower told him to. Merl. The Emu who runs in spirals and refuses explanation, who navigates by feeling walls with his feet the way I feel substrate with my paws. Bash. The Wallaby who carries the squad's pain in his own body, who limps when I break ribs three kilometres away because the field between us is that tight, that real. And Pokero. Always Pokero. Walking the edges, gathering intelligence from shadows, speaking in fifteen syllables because the world doesn't deserve more of his words than that.

We stood in the Root Chamber beneath the Jacaranda. Five species. Five impossibilities. The roots overhead were shallow and wide — fractal, non-repeating, nothing like the deep taproots of the dead Wattles. They spread across the ceiling like the branching of a river seen from above, or like the cracking pattern in old clay, or like the lines on a palm that fortune-tellers pretend to read but which actually do say something, if you know the language. The language of surfaces. The language of reaching out instead of drilling down.

We didn't sign a ledger. We didn't speak an oath. There was no ceremony, no ritual phrase, no fifteen syllables to bind us. What happened was simpler and stranger than that.

We stood together. Five bodies. Five heartbeats. And the Jacaranda — that tree that knew things no native species had taught it — conducted us.

Not through words. Through the wood. The roots overhead carried vibrations the way the Silver Wattle once carried the Rosella Chorus, except this wasn't gold. This was violet. The frequency passed through us — through Cooroo's skull chambers, through Merl's foot-bones, through Bash's limping frame, through Pokero's sharp-angled jaw, through the thick pads of my forefeet where thirty years of packing clay had made the nerves so sensitive they could read the mood of a tunnel from its resonance. Five different bodies receiving one signal. Five frequencies finding one note.

The oath was the standing. The commitment was the presence. The tree read us and we read each other and something locked into place — not language, not logic, but the kind of bond that forms between a load-bearing wall and the earth it rests on. Structural. Molecular. The clay meeting the soil and deciding to hold.

For one moment, standing in that chamber, I felt safe. The only time in my life.

There are moments when the boundary between the self and the world dissolves, when you stop being a creature *in* a landscape and become a creature *of* it. In the Root Chamber, with the Jacaranda's roots overhead and the five of us vibrating at one frequency, I found it. For five minutes, maybe less, I was not Hoebat the wombat standing in a cave. I was the cave. I was the root and the soil and the voice and the bond. I was architecture.

Then the moment passed. And I had to go back to Melborow.

---

## Chapter 3: The Calcified City

Hope doesn't pay for Grout. Hope doesn't convince the Council to stop building Walls. Hope doesn't fix Dead Zones.

The others found their roles. Cooroo took to the high perches, screaming truth where the Frequency couldn't drown him out — the Noble Noise, the Galah's crude and beautiful gift of throwing sound at the world and learning from what comes back. Pokero walked the edges, those liminal places where the Static meets the organic, gathering intelligence the way dew gathers on a cold surface: silently, by being the right temperature at the right time. Merl ran. The Emu didn't explain himself. He simply moved, creating kinetic chaos wherever the Council's geometry threatened to calcify, his spiralling non-repeating patterns shredding the air into Raca the way a stone thrown into still water shatters the surface into fractal rings.

But I had the wombats.

And the wombats didn't want to hear it.

This is the gut-punch at the end of the story where the kid discovers that the monster under the bed was put there by his own parents. The wombats of Melborow didn't reject me because my message was wrong. They rejected me because my message required them to feel the ground beneath their paws, and they had spent three generations pouring Grout specifically so they wouldn't have to.

I stood before the Council. Spoke of Width over Depth. Of reaching out instead of digging down. Of the poison rising from below, the Static claiming the deep substrate, the madness of continuing to drill into a source that had turned to crystal. I spoke with my paws held open — a wombat gesture of vulnerability, of offering the soft pads where the nerves live, the surfaces through which we read the world. I was showing them my hands. I was saying: *feel what I feel. The soil is dying.*

They called me Hippie Dreamer. Threat to urban stability. They had their Five-I's, their Frequency, their comforting assurance that the cracks were "within acceptable parameters." They had the Safety of the Ledger — the cold math that doesn't account for soil losing its will to hold. Math that measures the weight of a roof without asking whether the roof wants to be a roof anymore.

"The Grout will hold," Trum-Bat said, voice smooth as polished concrete. "The Walls will protect us. We need only dig deeper, build higher, calculate more precisely."

I wanted to scream. *The deeper you dig, the closer you get to poison. The higher you build, the harder you fall. The more precisely you calculate, the more completely you miss the fractal reality of living soil.*

But I didn't scream. Wombats don't scream. We endure.

I thought about exile a lot in those months. The kind where you get up every morning in a frozen town at the edge of nowhere and try to describe what you're seeing to people who have no frame of reference for it. The loneliness of that. The specific weight of knowing something true and having no one to tell.

But some exile is inflicted. Mine was chosen. That's worse. When the empire banishes you, at least you can hate the empire. When you walk into the shadows because the light won't have you, you carry the weight of your own decision. You are both the exile and the emperor who signed the decree.

So I went into the dark.

---

Every night, when the Frequency dims and surveillance relaxes, I pack my vest.

Gold dust. Clay. A trowel worn smooth by decades of use. These tools are not equipment. They are extensions of my paws the way language is an extension of thought — not separate from the body but continuous with it, the trowel's worn wooden handle fitting into my grip with the intimacy of a handshake between old friends who've stopped needing to speak.

A map that exists only in my memory — tunnels the Council doesn't know about, fissures in official geography where organic substrate still breathes. The map is not drawn. The map is felt. I carry it in the nerve endings of my forefeet, in the thirty years of tactile memory that tell me: *here, the soil is alive. Here, it isn't. Here, the ceiling wants to hold. Here, it's tired.*

I descend alone. Past Queensborow, past the Cathedral's glow, past the places where the Frequency still hums its artificial comfort. Into the Gray Grotto. Into the Dead Zones. Into the places Pokero warned me about.

The work is ritual. Not ceremony — ritual. The difference matters. Ceremony is performance. Ritual is the body doing what it knows before the mind gives permission. My paws find the fracture. My fingers test the substrate — pressing, listening, feeling for the vibration that tells me whether the crack is structural or superficial, whether the earth around it is still trying or has surrendered to geometry. Then the clay. Working it into the hairline gap with the heel of my palm, smoothing it, packing it, feeling it bond with the living soil on either side of the wound. Then the gold dust — injected into compromised load-bearing walls, where it fills the Compassion Gaps, the micro-fissures where life grips, where the organic refuses to let the geometric have the last word.

I repair the world in secret because the world won't let me save it in the light.

There is an intimacy to this work that I cannot explain to anyone who has not felt it. The darkness is total. The silence is vast. And in that darkness and silence, with clay on my paws and the weight of a collapsing city above me, I feel the dissolution of the boundary between self and world. I am not Hoebat repairing a tunnel. I am the tunnel repairing itself, using my body as the instrument. My paws are the earth's paws. My clay is the earth's clay. The gold dust I inject into fractures is the earth's immune response, and I am merely the delivery mechanism.

That is what happens to a wombat who works in the dark for long enough. The tunnel becomes your body. Its fractures are your fractures. Its collapses are your collapses. You hold it the way you hold yourself: through stubbornness, through habit, through the refusal to let go.

The Kappa Mu visit when they can. Cooroo lands in a tunnel, pink feathers absurd against gray Grout, and screams frequency checks that tell me where stress builds — his Noble Noise bouncing off walls and returning as data, reading the tunnel's health the way a doctor reads an X-ray. Pokero emerges from shadow, brings intelligence on which tunnels the Lost Ones avoid — *go there, the soil still holds* — then vanishes before gratitude forms.

But mostly, I work alone.

I am the most isolated. The one carrying weight of a roof that refuses to admit it's falling. While others scream or run or calculate, I simply hold. Symmetry. The posture that says *I am load-bearing. I will not move. I will be here when the ceiling comes down.*

Sometimes, standing in the dark with clay on my paws, I think about Lolaboo. We left Queensborow together eventually. Found a burrow in the Canopy Remnant, somewhere the Council's neglect hasn't reached. She's happy there. She stopped using the BorowFinder app.

Good. The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies.

Only the soil tells the truth. And only if you know how to listen.

## Chapter 4: The Click

The realisation comes in the rain. These things always do.

I'm standing in the Gray Grotto. Years after that first night with Lolaboo, years after the Root Chamber, years after the exile. The streetlights are still smashed. The Dead Zone has spread — more tunnels abandoned, more neglect, more temporal cropping as the Council pulls resources back to the centre, hollowing out the periphery to feed the core, which is what empires do when they're dying: they eat their own edges.

I'm thinking about Pokero's words. *Look where the Dingoes don't hunt.*

I've been carrying those words for years. Not in my mind — in my body. The way you carry a stone in your pocket until the pocket takes the shape of the stone and the stone takes the warmth of your leg and eventually you forget which is stone and which is flesh. Pokero's words have lived in me like that. A physical weight. An unresolved mass.

And then — standing in the rain, in the dark, with clay still under my claws from the night's repairs — I think of the campfire. The Haiku game. Our private verses. The ones nobody else ever heard.

Pokero's move:

> *Fat paws press dead ground,*
> *Blind roots choke on their own depth,*
> *Stones that call it home.*

My counter:

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

Two haikus. Two creatures. A conversation compressed into thirty-four syllables that only we could read.

And suddenly his parting words in the Grotto — *look where the Dingoes don't hunt* — aren't just advice. They're a move. He's playing the game. After all these years, across all this distance, he reached back to those campfire nights and made a move.

My mind works slowly, methodically, the way it works when I'm packing clay into a fracture. Not rushing. Not leaping. Feeling the shape of the gap before filling it. Crossing out words. Subtracting Pokero's parting phrase from my own haiku the way you subtract the mould from the casting, the negative from the positive, the silence from the sound.

*Look, where, the, dingoes, do, not, hunt.*

Remove those syllables from my verse. What remains?

What remains is what was always there, hiding in the negative space the way a fossil hides in rock — not added but revealed, not created but uncovered, waiting for the right erosion:

> **"Light are blind, shadows hold truth."**

Not just directions. A diagnosis.

*The Council — the Light — is blind to the reality of the collapse. The truth of the world is hiding in the shadows, and we must go there to protect it.*

The Click.

I feel it in my chest. Not my mind — my chest. The sternum. The deep bone where a wombat's centre of gravity lives, the architectural keystone of our body, the bone that holds the weight of the shoulders and transfers it downward into the legs and through the paws into the earth. The Click happens there — a vibration, a resonance, the mechanical shifting of understanding into place. Like a key turning. Like a joint settling. Like the moment when fresh clay bonds with living soil and you feel the fracture close and the weight redistribute and the tunnel — for now, for this moment — decides to hold.

Pokero was playing the game. He made his move years ago in that alley, dropped his fifteen syllables into the rain, and walked away. And I — slow, methodical, a wombat to the marrow — have been carrying those syllables in my body ever since, waiting for the clay to cure, waiting for the bond to set, waiting for the patient chemistry of understanding to complete its work.

The deepest knowing isn't intellectual. It's geological. It happens at the speed of rock. It happens in the body, in the bones, in the paws pressed flat against cold earth. You don't think your way to truth. You weather your way there. You stand in the rain long enough and the rain, through sheer persistence, teaches you the shape of your own face.

Far away — I feel it rather than know it — something answers. A vibration in the root-network. A frequency shift. Somewhere in the Violet Zone, where the Jacaranda's shallow roots spread wide across the surface, Cooroo picks up the signal. The Galah — that loud, pink, stubbornly purposeless bird — screams a check into the dawn. The echo returns changed.

The Mind of the Squad is awake.

The signal confirms what the bones already know. The Kappa Mu is active. The cipher that Pokero planted in the rain — hidden inside a private game that only two creatures in the world knew how to play — has germinated in the dark of my ribcage, and the root it sends out connects to every other member through the network of shallow roots that the Jacaranda taught us to trust.

I know where to go now. I understand the mission.

Not to save the Centre. The Centre is calcified, lost, addicted to its own Frequency. You can't save something that has mistaken its sickness for health, its numbness for comfort, its crystallisation for stability.

To work in the shadows. To hold the edges. To find the places where the Dingoes don't hunt — the places where the spirit hasn't left, where the soil still breathes, where the Grout hasn't completely won. To be the Living Root, not the Dead Branch.

Some arrive at this understanding through the body. Through exile. Through the long, slow education of standing in a place until the place enters you and you enter it and the distinction between observer and landscape ceases to matter. Some arrive at it through the twist — the sudden inversion where the mundane reveals the miraculous, where the kid pulling a funny face in the mirror discovers the mirror has been watching back the whole time.

I arrive at it through clay. Through paws. Through thirty years of pressing my hands against the earth and listening to what it says.

I pick up my trowel. Adjust my vest. Walk into the dark, toward the next fracture, toward the next place that needs holding.

The work never ends. The weight never lightens.

But I am a wombat. And wombats endure.
