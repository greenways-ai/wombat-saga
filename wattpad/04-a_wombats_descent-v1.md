# A Wombat's Descent

*Before the bond, there was the betrayal. And before the betrayal, there was a story.*

## Chapter 1: The Dreamer

The first thing the earth ever told me, it told me through my ear.

I was three years old, lying flat on the floor of our burrow while the rest of the household breathed its slow nighttime breath, and I pressed the side of my face against the packed clay and I listened. Not for anything in particular. Not expecting anything. Just the way you do when you are very small and the ground seems both more trustworthy and more interesting than the ceiling. The clay was cool. It smelled of mineral and old water and something living — the faint vegetable sweetness of roots nearby, feeding in the dark. And through the architecture of my skull, through bone and cartilage and the particular density of a wombat's ear, the earth spoke.

A vibration. Less sound than sensation. The pulse of something slow and vast and not quite sleeping.

I lay still for a long time, listening. I didn't have the word for it then.

Years later, Dad would give me the word. *Arnam.* The Pure Signal. The bio-electric murmur of a living world going about its business in the deep, the subtle handshake between root and stone, between stone and aquifer, between the aquifer and whatever lived below the aquifer in the country where no wombat's paw had ever reached. He said it the way you say the name of someone who has died — with care, with the particular care of naming a thing that can't correct you anymore.

We lived in the Eucalyptus Groves. Not the Groves now — the Groves as they were, that thin strip of surviving bushland where thirty-seven stringybarks still pulled water from a fault line and the air tasted of eucalyptus oil and something older. The High-Noses of Queensborow called it the "Wider Arnam," which was their polished way of saying: *here is where we put the things we don't want to look at.* We didn't mind. The stringybarks creaked at night like very old creatures settling deeper into their chairs. The roots in our ceiling were real roots, living roots, not the grey polymer the Academy sold as "organic substrate simulation." Our walls breathed. Our floor remembered.

Dad's name was Cornelibat. He'd been a Magistrate once. An auditor. The kind of creature who measured the world in columns — debt on the left, labour on the right, and the distance between them filled in with the cold scratch of an obsidian stilus. Then he'd done something the system couldn't forgive: he'd seen a Lo-Snout family, three young ones and a mother with the dust-cough, and he'd signed them a Advance that the books couldn't justify, because they needed it and the books were wrong.

They stripped his monocle. Exiled him to the Wider Arnam. Polished the records until he was a rounding error.

He never told me this directly. I pieced it together over years from the silences in our household, from the way he'd stiffen when the Council frequency rose — that manufactured hum piped through every burrow by Muskbat's infrastructure, the artificial Arnam-substitute that pulsed at exactly the frequency required to keep a wombat cooperative but never quite satisfied. From the way he wore his exiled dignity around his shoulders like a coat he couldn't afford to take off.

But at night, when the Frequency dropped to its dim setting and the stringybarks went quiet and the Groves pulled in around us like a held breath, Dad told me stories.

Not Council stories. Not the approved histories of Trumbat's heroic Grout-Layers paving the world in safety, not the authorised mythology of the Five Sovereigns whose wisdom filtered the chaos into something the population could bear. He told me about the **Dust-Bearers**.

The ones before the Grout. Before the Tally. Before the Static came and the cities built their walls against it and the walls became the city and the city became the cage. Wombats who pressed their bare forepaws into the substrate and felt — not calculated, not measured, but *felt* — which soil wanted to hold and which had given up the will to it. Who dug tunnels by listening. Who repaired damage not with sealant but with attention, with the particular quality of presence that living things generate when they are genuinely attending to something beyond themselves.

"They didn't fix the earth, Hoebat," he'd say, his paw moving slow and warm through the fur behind my ear. "They tended it. The way you tend a fire. You don't own it. You serve it."

I'd lie in my sleeping nook with the cool clay against my back and feel, beneath the Frequency's artificial hum, that other signal. The real one. Patient. Geological. The heartbeat of a world that the Council's infrastructure hadn't managed to silence all the way to the margins.

I was listening for the earth.

I didn't know the name of what I wanted to be. But the feeling was as clear as clay: I didn't want to be a digger. I wanted to be a *mender*.

## Chapter 2: The Academy of Structural Compliance

Sector 7 Academy smelled of Safety Grout and institutional indifference, which are, in my experience, the same smell.

The curriculum was a thing of mathematical sadness. Safety Grout Geometry. Static-Logic. The taxonomy of substrate as *problem*, as *material*, as the passive object of engineering intelligence. They never asked how the earth was doing. They told us how much weight it could bear before it stopped.

"The substrate," Mr. Carbat would intone from the front of the classroom, his pointer tapping a cross-section diagram, "does not have preferences." And across the back of my notebook, in the margin beside his beautifully certified indifference, I'd write: *wrong.*

Because the substrate beneath Sector 7 Academy had preferences. I could feel them through the seat of my chair, through the thick clay-pads of my hindquarters, through the sensitive soles of my feet pressed flat against the grouted classroom floor. The earth down there was unhappy. Not structurally compromised — unhappy. A distinction the curriculum didn't offer a category for.

Barnabat saved me from going quietly mad.

He was two rows ahead, a wombat built like a series of confident decisions, his nose always pointed at something the rest of us hadn't noticed yet. He drew a map on the back of a Static-Logic worksheet — which felt appropriate, that contraband geography drawn over the authorised version — and slid it across the desks without looking.

*Behind the gym. Old substrate. No Grout. No permits. Just dirt.*

There were four of us: Barnabat, Duzbat, Flickboo, and me. We'd slip through a crack in the service wall during lunch hours — a gap the maintenance crew hadn't bothered sealing because it faced the lower levels, the part nobody inspected — and drop into the old country.

Down there, we dug the way the Dust-Bearers dug. Following the grain of the soil. Letting the earth suggest the tunnel rather than imposing one. We found chambers where the substrate was soft and damp and smelled of deep water, and we'd sit in them with our paws flat on the floor, feeling the vibration the Academy had tried to grout over.

Barnabat had a theory he repeated until it stopped being a theory and became a fact: "The Grout is a muzzle. The earth is talking. We just can't hear it from up there."

He wasn't wrong. Down there, we were happy. Down there, we were idiots.

We were twelve.

## Chapter 3: The Collapse

The tremor came during fifth period on a Tuesday, which is the most Tuesday thing a catastrophe can do.

Not a large one — Melborow gets micro-tremors every week, the substrate adjusting to the city's weight the way a back adjusts to a burden that's never going to lift. The Academy's sensors registered 2.1 on the Grout Scale. *No Action Required.* Filed. Forgotten.

We noticed.

We were in the unauthorised tunnels. Six of us. The ceiling — unlined, ungrouted, old country clay that had never been measured or sealed — gave way in a surgical section about four meters wide. The place where the Academy's relief drains, never cleared, had been seeping for years.

Clay fell. Dust filled the air with the taste of old stone.

Flickboo was through the service wall before the second clod hit the floor. Duzbat took a hit to the shoulder that would have broken a smaller wombat, stumbled, pulled himself clear. The two from 4-B — I never knew their names properly, only that they laughed when they dug, only that they were there and then they weren't — went under the main fall without a sound.

No sound. That was the thing. Not a cry, not a struggle. Just the *thump* of wet earth closing a conversation.

I couldn't see them. I couldn't hear them. But I could hear Barnabat. He was on the other side of the fall, pinned against the wall by the secondary slide, his voice doing something I'd never heard it do before: going small.

"I can't — it's on my leg — I can't—"

The secondary ceiling was groaning. I felt it not with my ears but through my paws, through the substrate, that low-register communication of stressed clay deciding whether to hold. Thirty seconds. Maybe less.

I pressed my ear against the fall of clay and I listened the way Dad had described. I didn't calculate. I didn't consult a load table. I found the Soft Spot — a hairline weakness where the clay hadn't fully compacted, the Compassion Gap, the place where the earth, even in its violence, had left a door not quite closed.

I dug. With my forepaws. With everything the Academy's curriculum didn't teach and my body somehow already knew.

Barnabat's paw came through the gap. I pulled. The rest of the ceiling made its decision and came down like a fist, and we lay on the tunnel floor, panting, covered in clay.

He was alive. His leg was bruised. I had saved him.

Two others were not alive. The earth had taken them into itself and closed over them the way water closes over a dropped stone, smooth and final.

I was twelve years old and I had learned that the earth gives, and the earth takes, and between those two facts is the whole history of everything.

## Chapter 4: The Silencing

The next day, there was no memorial. No assembly. No recognition that two students had disappeared through the floor of the world they were being educated in.

There was a chair in the Principal's office, and in it I sat. The Principal — Sektorbat, the administrative colour of institutional carpet — stood behind his desk. A High Auditor sat to the side. The kind of wombat who files his claws. Whose violence is entirely bureaucratic.

The falsified statement sat on the desk in Barnabat's shaky handwriting. *Reckless Excavation. Gross Negligence. Caused Death by Unsafe Digging.*

I stared at the signature. My best friend's name. The name of the wombat I had just pulled from the earth with my bare paws.

"He was trapped," I said. "I went back. I found the soft spot. I dug him out."

"Barnabat's account indicates," the Auditor said, in the voice of someone describing weather, "that you blocked the exit."

The room was sealed, Grouted, perfectly silent in the way that things sealed against the natural world are silent: completely, abnormally, the silence of cotton stuffed into a wound. I put my paws flat on the desk surface — institutional tile, not clay, nothing coming through it — and felt absolutely nothing. The floor of the Principal's office was a dead thing.

"That's a lie," I said.

"Structural assets don't lie," the Auditor said. "They assess risk and respond accordingly. Your friend assessed the risk of association with you and responded accordingly. I'd call that impressive structural intelligence for his age."

They expelled me. Filed me under *Gross Negligence* and shut the drawer.

Barnabat wasn't expelled. He was given a commendation for *Structural Awareness*. I saw him once, years later, in a foreman's vest. He was shouting at a Corvée crew. His face had the set look of a creature who has decided which muscle to stop exercising.

He didn't look at me.

Some creatures choose the honey. You can't hate them for it. You can only note the shape of what they leave behind.

## Chapter 5: The Fracture

The kitchen of our burrow in the Groves smelled of eucalyptus oil and whatever Mum had been boiling and the specific silence of a household braced for something.

Cornelibat stood at the counter. The notification form sat open on the table — official, stamped, filed. *Your son. Gross Negligence. Association with a liability.* His spine was very straight. That terrible straight spine he wore when the world was pressing hardest, the spine of a creature who had been broken once and rebuilt himself around the memory of it.

"I saved Barnabat," I said. "I used the Old Ways. I pressed my ear to the clay and I found the Soft Spot and I pulled him out."

"I know."

"Then help me. File a complaint. You were a Seam-Reader. You know how to read a tunnel record. The relief drains were clogged. That's why the ceiling—"

"Hoebat." He turned. His eyes held the moisture of a creature who has already had this argument with himself and lost it. "I can't."

"You *won't*."

"Same thing."

"It is not the same thing." And here is where I became cruel, the way children are cruel — precisely, accurately, with full knowledge of where the blade will land. "You told me about the Dust-Bearers. Every night. You said they *tended* the earth. You said they served it. If you won't stand up for those stories in the real world, they were just — they were bedtime garbage. Something you told a kid so he'd feel special. So he'd go to sleep."

He flinched. The substrate before it fractures.

"I won't be a Grout-Layer," I said. "I won't keep my head down while they bury the truth in a Maintenance Event."

I packed my trowel. A waterskin. Clay samples from our own floor — living clay, the kind that still remembered what it was. I left through the root-channel, not the front door. I didn't look back.

If I had looked back, I might have seen his paws shake. I might have seen him press his forehead against the kitchen wall — the wall with the living roots threaded through it, the wall that still hummed with that quiet geological pulse — and whisper something I wouldn't understand for twenty years.

I was fourteen. I understood everything.

I went down.

---

## Chapter 6: The Sump-Dweller

The basement levels of the Gray Grotto are where Melborow stores the things it doesn't want to think about.

Corroded pipes. Leaking sumps. Infrastructure older than the Council, dug by creatures whose names were never notched into any Tally. And wombats — the kind the upper levels pretend don't exist. Lo Snouts who couldn't afford the Tally-Debt. Exiles. The broken things that roll downhill because that's what gravity does to the discarded.

I lived there for three years. I became a Ghost-Digger. An unauthorised repairman.

The Council's infrastructure was failing from the bottom up — sumps spilling, walls cracking, relief drains compacted with silt nobody budgeted to clear. When the rains hit Melborow, the water had nowhere to go but through the seepage walls into the Lo Snout tunnels. The Council called it *perimeter redistribution*. The Lo Snouts called it drowning.

I fixed things. I packed clay into fractures nobody had reported because reporting meant Tallies and Tallies meant debt. I cleared drains with my bare paws. I shored failing ceilings with scavenged timber. Nobody paid me. Nobody thanked me. Nobody knew my name.

I was bitter. I was alone. And I was, without knowing it, learning.

Every fractured wall I tended, every drain I cleared, every ceiling I held with my hands and my stubbornness — each one was a lesson. Not the Academy's lessons. Real ones. The kind that enter through the paws and settle in the bone. I was learning the language of damaged earth. Learning to read stress the way a doctor reads a pulse. Learning that a crack isn't just a structural failure; it's a sentence. *Here, the substrate was pushed past what it could hold. Here, something was taken that wasn't given back. Here, the world is asking for attention it never received.*

Three years of this. Three years of darkness and anonymity and the slow accumulation of knowledge that has no credential. Three years of becoming, without meaning to, the thing Dad's stories had described.

Then I found the beggar.

---

## Chapter 7: The Beggar Fool

The drainage vault on Sub-Level 4 had been condemned and sealed with a bead of Safety Grout that was supposed to last forever.

The Grout had cracked. Of course it had. Grout always cracks eventually — this is the secret the Council cannot admit, the structural contradiction buried in every building code: the substance poured to prevent fractures is itself subject to fracture. The fix needs fixing. It's turtles all the way down, except the turtles are synthetic sealant and the bottom turtle is a lie.

I found the crack tracing a water leak from Sub-Level 3. Followed it through a service corridor the maintenance maps didn't include, into a chamber that smelled of standing water and something else. Something territorial. The musk of a wombat who hadn't groomed in months but who was, somehow, not bothered by this.

He was sitting against the far wall, wrapped in a ceremonial sash — the gold thread gone brown, the Order sigil barely legible beneath layers of grime. He was talking to a jar.

Sealed. Glass. Empty.

He held it to his ear and nodded. "Yes," he muttered. "Yes, I agree. The acoustics are deplorable."

I stood in the doorway and considered my options, which were limited.

"Close the door, nephew," he said without looking up. "The silence escapes if you leave it open."

---

The jar wasn't empty.

I understood this later — not quickly, the way you understand a fact, but slowly, the way you understand a truth, which requires living with it for a while before it unpacks itself. The jar held something Hangbat had stolen from the Council years before: **Anti-Resonance**. The exact inverse frequency of the Melborow Frequency. He'd identified the cancellation note and collected the absence of sound into a vessel the way you collect rainwater, and he carried it around with him not because he needed it but because the Council had declared it *Resonance Terrorism*, and the things that terrify the Council are usually worth keeping close.

He was older than I'd expected. Gaunt. His fur had taken on the grey-brown tint of a creature who has lived underground so long that sunlight is a theoretical. But his eyes — when he looked up at me from the jar — were the eyes of a creature pretending to be broken so the unbroken part of him could keep working.

"Cornelibat's boy," he said. Not a question. "You have his paws. Wide. You've been doing the Ghost-Digger thing. How's that working out?"

"You're Uncle Hangbat."

"*The Family's Black Sheep*." He smiled. It was the smile of a creature who has been called every name in the lexicon and decided to wear the worst one like a coat. "But that's the costume, nephew. Do you want the name underneath?"

He opened the ceremonial sash. Stitched into the lining in thread that still held a faint golden glow — gold dust woven into fabric — was a title:

**Howlbaram. High Priest of Rites. Keeper of the Spiral-Step.**

"I am — or was — the creature responsible for the most sacred ritual in wombat civilisation," he said. "The ceremony in which we told ourselves we were saving the world."

He looked at the jar. The empty jar that wasn't empty.

"We weren't saving anything," he said. "We were feeding it."

---

## Chapter 8: The Beautiful Snare

The story Hangbat told me took three nights, not because it was long but because it kept breaking him.

Everyone in Melborow knew the Wombiki. The legendary dancers. The ancient order who performed the Spiral-Step — that rhythmic packing of soil that maintained the organic integrity of the burrows. In the official histories they were heroes, martyrs, creatures who had danced themselves into the foundations of the city and saved it through the power of sacred sacrifice.

The official histories, Hangbat explained with the particular bitterness of someone who had helped write them, were fiction.

They weren't martyrs. They were prisoners addicted to the luxury of their captivity — the good burrows, the soft bedding, the Grout-Honey that made imprisonment feel like privilege. In return, they danced. And when the Council decided a new sector needed *spiritual reinforcement*, a Wombiki was selected. Led to the designated tunnel. Danced into the wet Grout before it cured.

Sealed alive.

*Soul-Anchors.* That was the official doctrine. A dancer entombed at the moment of greatest resonance would anchor the organic frequency to the structure. Would hold back the Static through the power of sacrifice.

"The data didn't support it," Hangbat said, holding the jar. "Not once. Not in thirty Consecrations. The tunnels consecrated with Wombiki performed identically to the ones without. The sacrifice had no structural effect whatsoever. The engineers knew. The Council knew. The ritual was the point. The sacrifice was the product. It kept the population believing that someone was doing something about the crisis."

"And the Wombiki knew too," he said. "They felt the frost creeping into the honey. They knew, and they kept dancing. Because feeling the truth would have meant feeling the full weight of the collapse, and that weight was heavier than any of them could carry alone."

He stopped. The jar sat in his lap. Outside, the Sub-Level pipes made their small industrial complaints, the sound of infrastructure confessing its own failure one drip at a time.

"All except one."

*One.* His voice changed on that word — from the bitter control of a creature recounting history to the raw geography of grief.

"Vara," he said.

---

She'd been his student. The most gifted Wombiki of her generation — not because her Spiral-Step was the most precise, but because she danced with her eyes open, and what she saw she couldn't pretend she hadn't seen.

She stood up in the Rehearsal Chamber and told the other Wombiki: *the Consecration is theatre. The Grout has no spiritual properties. They are killing us for decoration. We should stop dancing.*

They heard her. They believed her. They went back to the honey.

Vara was scheduled for the Consecration of Sector 7. Hangbat — Howlbaram, High Priest, the creature who was supposed to preside over her entombment — walked into the ceremony and danced the Broken Spiral instead. Shattered the wet Grout before it could cure. Ruined the batch. Stopped the Consecration.

"And Vara?" I asked.

He was quiet for a long time.

"Trumbat killed her," he said. Flat. The voice of a creature stating a measurement. "Quietly. Through infrastructure. She was found in a sealed tunnel in Sector 7. The official report said structural failure. The tunnel had been grouted the night before. Fresh pour. Perfect Grout. Not a crack in it."

He looked at me. His eyes were past tears. Past the point where grief has anything wet left to offer.

"They didn't just kill her, Hoebat. They *used* her. Her last frequency — the resonance of her fear, her defiance, the vibration of a creature dying in Grout with the truth still in her throat — they wove it into the Melborow Frequency. That hum you hear in every tunnel, every waking moment. It isn't just Muskbat's broadcast. It's the sound of everyone they've buried. Vara's last breath is in there. Singing you to sleep."

I sat in the drainage vault and felt the Frequency pressing against my fur. The constant background hum of Melborow. The sound of safety.

The sound of a murdered dancer, screaming forever through the city's infrastructure. Every note of it the Council's property. Every note of it stolen.

Something in the chamber felt wrong after he said that. Not dangerous wrong — *wrong* wrong. The jar on his knee pulsed. Just once. The way something will stir that has been still for a very long time, recognising a name it knows.

I chose not to mention it.

---

## Chapter 9: The Gold Seam

Hangbat refused to teach me Grout-Geometry. "You can learn that anywhere," he said. "They hand it out like pamphlets. I'm going to teach you the language of breaking things open."

The True Kintsugi-Mu.

Not the hiding of breaks. The illumination of them.

"Kintsugi," he said. "The break made the strongest part by filling it with gold. The Grout tries to hide the fracture — seal it, smooth it, pretend the damage was never there. But the crack was real. And every creature who walks over a hidden fracture carries the weight of its concealment without knowing they're carrying it."

He held up a clay shard — jagged, sharp-edged, the kind of thing you'd step around.

"Fill the break with gold. Not to decorate it. To conduct something through it. The fracture is where the Arnam can enter — the empathy-frequency that living things generate when they're truly in relationship with each other. Grout keeps the light out. Kintsugi invites it in."

He kept the gold dust in a pouch of wattle-bark — actual bark, carrying the faint resonance of a tree that had been dead for longer than either of us had been alive. The dust inside was warm to the touch. And when you held it in your palm, it vibrated. Not physically. *Emotionally*. The way a room vibrates when someone in it is crying and everyone pretends not to notice.

I tried to articulate what I was feeling and couldn't. Hangbat watched me fail to articulate it for a while, then said: "Good. The ones who can describe it too easily haven't felt it."

"You cannot mend stone," he told me, watching me pack gold-laced clay into a fracture, "until you mend the spirit of the creature who dug it."

"The stone doesn't have a spirit."

"Everything dug by a wombat has a spirit. The spirit of the digger enters the substrate through the paws. That's what paws are for, Hoebat — not just tools. Transmitters. Every tunnel in Melborow holds the emotional residue of the creature who carved it. The angry tunnels are brittle. The fearful tunnels leak. There are almost no joyful tunnels. That tells you something about who dug them."

I pressed the gold-clay into the fracture. Felt it bond with the substrate on both sides. Felt the warmth of the gold conducting something through the break — not heat, not current, but *connection*. The two walls of the fracture, which had been pulling apart for years, relaxed. Settled. Found a new equilibrium that was different from the original but not weaker.

Stronger. The gold seam was stronger than the unbroken wall.

For months I did it. In the drainage vault, in abandoned tunnels, in the crumbling lower levels where nobody came. Learning the language of damaged earth. Learning that a crack is not a failure — it's an opening. The place where the light enters.

"The city is a fractured soul," Hangbat said one night, when the gold dust was running low and the silence in his jar was thick with something I still couldn't name. "Every wall, every foundation — carrying the weight of what was done to the Wombiki. The Grout holds the fear in. The Kintsugi lets it out."

He pressed the last of his gold-dust pouch into my paw. He'd been saving it. For this. For me.

"You must go to the Shattered Gorge," he said. "Not to hide. To learn. The Gorge is where the earth still bleeds — where the fracture is so deep and honest that even the Council can't Grout it over. Find the places that still hurt. That's where the mending starts."

I packed my bag. Trowel. Gold dust. Clay. The things that matter when the Frequency dies and the lights go out.

"Uncle," I said at the door.

"Hangbat," he corrected. "The name Howlbaram died with Vara. What's left is a beggar with a jar."

He waved a paw. Already turning back, already listening to whatever the absence of sound was saying into the glass.

"Don't thank me," he said. "Go mend something."

## Chapter 10: The Screaming Bird

The Shattered Gorge cuts across the southern shell of Hún Nico like a wound that refused to close.

The northern face: rough, root-threaded, alive — you can press your paw against it and feel the slow pulse of substrate that still remembers how to hold. The southern face: smooth, geometric, the hexagonal facets of the Static claiming the stone cell by cell, patient as mathematics, cold as a calculation that knows it has time. Between them: nothing. Air and depth and the sound of the earth breathing through its largest wound.

I spent weeks there. Walking the rim. Descending into the crevices where the crystal formations were transitional — half-formed, blurry at the edges, the lattice in the process of claiming territory but not yet finished. I studied the anatomy of the break. I packed gold-clay into fractures no Council inspector would ever see. I talked to the stone, which sounds like madness and is, and also works.

The earth in the Gorge was different from the earth in Melborow. It was *honest*. In the city, the substrate has been so thoroughly sealed, so aggressively silenced, that feeling anything through it takes decades of training. In the Gorge, it speaks at full volume. Every layer, every stratum, every compressed epoch of geological history exposed and readable, shouting its composition to any creature with paws sensitive enough to listen.

I was listening when the bird fell.

Not fell — *crashed*. The distinction matters. Falling is what gravity does to objects. Crashing is what gravity does to creatures who are still trying to fly when their wings have given out.

He came down like a pink comet. A streak of colour against the grey-brown stone — juvenile Galah, oversized head, undersized wings, the proportions of a creature who hasn't grown into himself yet. He hit the northern face thirty meters above me, bounced off a ledge, tumbled through a crevice, came to rest on a scree slope in a cloud of dust and pure outrage.

One wing at the wrong angle. Blood from half a dozen scrapes. His crest up — fully up, the pink feathers standing vertical, which in Galah body language means either *I am experiencing intense emotion* or *I am about to make a terrible decision.*

In his good claw, he held a seed. Small. Dark. Pulsing with a faint violet light that had absolutely no business existing in a place as broken as the Gorge.

Above: the mechanical buzz of a Council surveillance drone, hunting him across the border zones.

I didn't think. I covered him with my body. The way a wombat covers the thing he's holding. The Gorge's northern face was too rough, too fractured, too organic for the drone's crystal-calibrated optics. It passed. Circled. Passed again. Moved on.

The bird was shaking. Not from cold — from something in his frequency. His whole body vibrating at a pitch I'd never encountered: high, jagged, the resonance of a creature who has been flying on terror for hours and finally run out of sky.

I reached into my vest for the gold-clay. Pressed a pinch to his chest — not his wing, that was a physical problem, physical problems could wait. The fear-resonance was the structural emergency. I felt the clay absorb the frequency, draw it down, conduct it into the earth beneath us, where the Gorge's living substrate held it the way it held everything: with patience, with depth, with the geological stubbornness of stone that has been broken a thousand times and is still here.

The Galah stopped shaking.

His crest came down. Half an inch. Enough.

He looked at me. His eyes were enormous — the eyes of a creature who has seen something too large for his skull and is still trying to contain it. He didn't thank me. He shoved the seed into my paw.

It was warm. It pulsed against my palm the way the gold dust pulsed — not physically but *emotionally*, carrying a frequency that my hands could read and my brain hadn't yet named.

"Plant it where the Grout cracks, kid," he said. His voice was raw, cracked at the edges, the voice of something that has been screaming for a very long time and only recently paused. "The Violet needs a fracture."

He looked at the Gorge — the great wound in the earth, the break too honest for even the Council to cover over.

"That's a Jacaranda. That's the new tree. Not a Wattle — those are done. Something with shallow roots. Something that reaches *out* instead of drilling down."

He coughed. Blood at the corner of his beak. His wing was worse than I'd thought.

"My name's Cooroo," he said. "I'm a Galah. And I've been screaming longer than you've been digging. So here's the deal: you plant that seed, you hold it, you do whatever it is wombats do when they're tending something that isn't dead yet. When it grows — and it will grow, because the Violet doesn't know how to quit — it's going to need more than a wombat with a trowel. It's going to need all of us."

He passed out. Which was probably the most sensible thing he'd done all day.

I sat in the Gorge with a broken Galah and a violet seed and the last of Hangbat's gold dust.

The earth beneath my paws was humming. Not the Frequency — the real signal, the Arnam, the thing I'd first heard at three years old lying on our kitchen floor in the Groves while the household slept and the stringybarks creaked outside and the world seemed both more trustworthy and more interesting than the ceiling.

I pressed the seed into the clay. Into the fracture at the Gorge's northern face, where organic met crystalline and neither had won yet. Into the Compassion Gap — that microscopic pocket where life grips because the geometry can't quite reach.

The Violet needs a fracture.

And the Gorge was full of them.

I packed the earth around the seed with my bare paws. Slowly. Gently. The way Dad used to smooth the fur behind my ear at night in the Groves, the way the Dust-Bearers tended the earth in his stories — not fixing, not sealing, not imposing structure on something that didn't want it.

*Tending.*

The seed pulsed. Once. Twice.

A heartbeat inside the stone.

I stayed. I had nowhere else to be. The work begins where you are and the earth doesn't check your credentials first.
