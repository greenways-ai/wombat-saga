# A Wombat's Descent

*In which the earth teaches what the Council forbids, and a beggar reveals that the walls themselves are screaming.*

## I. The Dust-Bearer's Son

I grew up in the Eucalyptus Groves because the Council had not yet decided they were worth killing.

This was not mercy. It was bookkeeping. The Groves lay at the junction of two administrative sectors, each claiming jurisdiction and neither accepting the cost of grouting such unruly terrain. So the stringybarks remained — thirty-seven of them, their bark shedding in long strips that curled like burnt paper, like messages written and immediately regretted. Their roots still drank from a fault line in the bedrock where the water remembered how to taste of something other than Chemical Safety.

My father was Cornelibat. Before the exile, he had been a Tally-Magistrate — an official auditor who measured soil in columns and debt in tonnes, who filed reports in triplicate and believed, with the fervent faith of the newly converted, that the world could be made safe through proper documentation.

Then he showed compassion where compassion wasn't budgeted.

They stripped him of his monocle and sent him to the Wider Arnam — the Council's polite way of saying *we are throwing you away but we would like you to feel spiritual about it.* He never spoke of what exactly he had done. I learned it through the architecture of what wasn't said. Through the rigid orthodoxy he wore afterward like armour, the desperate need to prove he was still respectable, still structural, still a creature who could be trusted with load-bearing responsibilities.

But at night, when the Frequency dimmed and the Groves went quiet, he told me stories.

Not Council stories. He told me about the Dust-Bearers.

The original soil-tenders. The wombats who came before the Grout, before the Safety Geometry, before the Tallies and the numbered codes. The ones who packed earth with their bare paws and understood — not through calculation but through touch — which soil wanted to hold and which had given up. The Dust-Bearers didn't pour Grout. They listened. They pressed their forefeet into substrate and felt the vibration, the pulse, the geological murmur that told them whether the ground beneath their claws was alive or dying.

"They didn't fix the earth, Hoebat," he'd whisper. "They tended it. The way you tend a garden. The way you tend a fire. You don't control it. You serve it."

I'd lie in my burrow-nook, the damp earth pressing cool against my back, and feel for the vibration he described. Not imagining it. Feeling it. The slow pulse of the substrate beneath our home, the deep geological heartbeat that the Groves still carried because the Council's Grout hadn't reached this far.

Other joeys played Grout-Tag in the cleared zones. I went to the backyard and pressed my ear to the dirt.

I didn't know the word for what I wanted to be. But the feeling was clear as clay: I didn't want to dig. I wanted to *mend*.

---

## II. The Academy of Structural Compliance

The Sector 7 Academy smelled of Safety Grout and fluorescent lighting.

Two things that have no business sharing a sentence with "education," yet there they were: the chemical tang of synthetic sealant and the humming pallor of the Council's Glow-Panels, buzzing at a frequency designed to keep young wombats alert, compliant, and incurious. The Academy sat in the mid-levels of the Gray Grotto, a warren of right-angled classrooms bored into the substrate with the precision and warmth of a tax ledger.

I hated it.

The curriculum was Safety Grout Geometry and Static-Logic. They taught that the earth was dead material — a problem to be solved, a variable to be controlled, a surface to be sealed against its own inconvenient tendency to shift, breathe, and remember. They taught the Grout tables: ratios, cure times, tensile strengths, load-bearing calculations for every substrate classification from Type A (compliant) to Type F (resistant).

They never once mentioned the Dust-Bearers.

"The earth," Mr. Carbat intoned, tapping his pointer against a cross-section diagram, "does not have preferences. The earth does not have moods. The earth is substrate. It is material. Our job is to impose structure upon it."

I sat in the back row and felt my paws itch. Because the earth beneath the classroom floor was humming. Not loudly — the Grout muffled it, the way cotton muffles a heartbeat — but it was there. A low, slow vibration that the Academy's foundation hadn't quite managed to silence. The substrate under Sector 7 was unhappy. Not structurally compromised — unhappy. A distinction the curriculum did not recognise.

Barnabat saved me from going mad.

He sat two rows ahead, a stocky, persuasive wombat with a nose that always seemed to be pointing at opportunity and a laugh that carried through tunnels the way water carries through limestone — finding every crack, filling every void. He didn't care about Safety Grout Geometry. He cared about digging. Real digging. The old kind, where you felt your way forward with your paws and the tunnel went where the earth wanted it to go.

"Behind the gym," he whispered one morning, sliding a crude map across the desk. "There's tunnels. Unauthorised. No Grout. No permits. Just dirt."

He wasn't alone. Duzbat was there — a quiet giant who could move rocks that machines struggled with, already looking tired even at twelve. And Flickboo — nervous, quick, always checking the exits, terrified of getting caught but terrified of missing out even more.

"You in?" Barnabat said. "We need a listener."

I was in.

---

The unauthorised tunnels behind the gym were the happiest place in Sector 7.

A half-dozen of us would slip away during lunch, squeezing through a crack in the service wall that the maintenance crew hadn't bothered to seal. We'd drop into the old substrate and dig.

No permits. No diagrams. No ratios or cure times. Just paws and dirt and the ancient conversation between a wombat and the ground. We dug the way Dad's stories described — feeling for roots, following the grain of the soil, letting the earth suggest the tunnel's path. We found chambers where the substrate was soft and damp and smelled of deep water, and we'd sit in them with our eyes closed and our paws flat on the floor, feeling the vibration, the geological pulse that the Academy pretended didn't exist.

Barnabat had a theory. "The earth is alive," he'd say, packing a wall with his bare palms. "It talks. The Grout is just a muzzle."

We were happy. We were idiots. We were twelve.

---

## III. The Compassion Gap

The tremor came during fifth period on a Tuesday.

Not a large one — Melborow gets micro-tremors weekly, the substrate adjusting to the weight of the city. The Academy's structural sensors registered a 2.1 on the Grout Scale, categorised as "negligible" and filed under "No Action Required."

We noticed.

We were in the unauthorised tunnels — Barnabat, me, Duzbat, Flickboo, and two others from Class 4-B. The tremor hit, and the ungrouted ceiling gave way.

Not everywhere. The collapse was surgical — a section of roof maybe four meters wide, where the substrate had been weakened by water seepage from the Academy's relief drains overhead. The drains the maintenance crew should have cleared.

Clay fell. Dust exploded.

Flickboo was fast — through the crack before the first clod hit the floor. Duzbat was slower, but strong; he took a hit to the shoulder, stumbled, and dragged himself out.

The two from 4-B were under the main fall. There was no sound. Just the sickening *thump* of wet earth closing a conversation forever.

I couldn't see them. But I could hear Barnabat.

"Hoebat!" His voice was high. Tight. "I can't — it's on my leg — I can't—"

The secondary roof was groaning. I could hear it — not with my ears but with my paws, through the substrate, the deep vibration of stressed clay deciding whether to hold or let go. The ceiling had maybe thirty seconds before it committed to the decision the Academy had classified as "negligible."

I didn't run. I pressed my ear to the wall of fallen clay and I listened.

Dad's stories. The Dust-Bearers. *They didn't fix the earth. They listened.*

The stress-fracture was three centimetres to my left — a hairline weakness where the clay hadn't fully compacted. The Soft Spot. The Compassion Gap. The place where the earth, even in its violence, had left a door ajar.

I dug. Not with math. With instinct. With the thirty-thousand-year-old knowledge that lives in a wombat's forepaws. I felt the clay part around my claws, felt the air pocket open, felt Barnabat's paw reaching through the gap.

I pulled him out. Dragged him through the dust just as the rest of the ceiling came down.

We lay on the tunnel floor, panting, covered in clay, alive. Barnabat's leg was bruised but unbroken. I'd saved him using the Old Ways.

But the two from 4-B were gone. Buried under six tonnes of "negligible" substrate adjustment.

I was twelve years old and I had just learned that the earth gives, but it also takes.

## IV. The Silencing

There was no assembly. No memorial.

There was a chair in the Principal's office. Sektorbat — whose fur was the colour of institutional carpet — stood behind his desk. He wasn't alone.

A High Auditor was there. Neat. Compact. The kind of wombat who files his claws. The kind whose violence is administrative.

"Hoebat," Sektorbat began. "We have received a full statement regarding yesterday's... incident."

"They're dead," I said. "The two from 4-B. They're dead because the relief drains were clogged."

"The relief drains were fully operational," the Auditor said. Quiet. Measured. "The structural failure was caused by unauthorised excavation. By reckless, unpermitted digging that destabilised the foundation."

He placed a document on the desk. A witness statement. Signed in a shaky, twelve-year-old scrawl.

*Barnabat.*

"Your friend has been very cooperative," the Auditor said. "He explains that the excavation was entirely your initiative. That he and the others tried to leave when the tremors started, but you insisted on continuing. That you forced them to dig deeper."

The room tilted. I could feel the floor beneath my chair — the Grouted, sealed, dead floor.

"That's a lie," I whispered. "I saved him. He was trapped. I went back for him."

"Barnabat's statement says you blocked the exit," Sektorbat read. "That in your panic, you collapsed the secondary support, sealing the tunnel and preventing the other two students from escaping. He claims he only survived because he managed to dig around you."

"He's lying! I pulled him out! Ask Duzbat. Ask Flickboo."

"Duzbat and Flickboo have declined to comment," the Auditor said. "Which is the only intelligent structural decision they've made."

I stared at the document. The signature. The betrayal.

"They are structural assets," the Auditor continued. "And they have a future. Unlike you."

They expelled me. Effective immediately. "Gross Negligence — Causing Death by Reckless Excavation" in the permanent column. Barred from re-enrollment in any Sector Academy.

Barnabat wasn't expelled. He was given a commendation for "Structural Awareness" and a transfer to Advanced Engineering. I saw him once, years later, wearing a foreman's vest, shouting orders at a crew of diggers, his face hard with the lines of a creature who has decided that survival is more important than truth.

He never looked at me.

---

## V. The Fracture

I went home.

Which meant descending three levels, squeezing through root-channels the Council hadn't mapped, walking the seep-line path. The stringybarks were creaking in the evening air. The smell of eucalyptus hit me like memory — like Dad's stories, like everything the Academy had tried to grout over.

Cornelibat was in the kitchen. He knew already. A formal notification, stamped, filed, efficient. His son had been expelled for Gross Negligence. His son was a liability.

I could see it in his posture. The rigidity. The desperate straightness of his spine — a wombat who had been exiled once for feeling too much, wrapping himself in structure so it could never happen again.

"Hoebat," he said. "Sit down."

"I saved Barnabat."

"I know."

"He lied, Dad. He told them it was my idea. He told them I killed those students. But I pulled him out. I saved his life."

"I know what he said." His voice was careful. Measured. "And I am telling you: keep your head down. The nail that sticks up gets hammered."

"Keep my head *down*? Dad, they lied. They erased the clogged drains. They're pinning two deaths on me!"

"I know."

"Then do something! You were a Root-Counter. You know how the system works. File a complaint. Audit the structural records. Prove the tunnel was compromised—"

"Hoebat." He turned from the counter. His eyes were wet. Not crying — Cornelibat didn't cry. But his eyes held the moisture of a creature who had already fought this fight, already lost. "I can't."

"You *won't*."

"Same thing."

"No it isn't! You told me about the Dust-Bearers. You told me they tended the earth. You told me—"

"Stories, Hoebat. I told you stories." His voice cracked, just at the edge where the Grout hadn't quite sealed. "Stories aren't shovels. Stories don't keep roofs from falling."

"Stories are all we have!"

"Stories are what got me exiled!" The outburst hung between us. He took a breath, steadied himself, put the mask back on. "I did what you want me to do. I spoke up. I filed the complaint. I pointed out the flaw in the Tally. And you know what happened? They didn't fix the flaw. They fixed *me*. They sent me here, to tell stories to a son who doesn't understand that the world is not a garden to be tended. It is a structure to be survived."

I looked at him — at the rigidity, the fear, the desperate need to be respectable. I saw a coward. I saw a warning. I saw everything I refused to become.

"Then I'll survive without you," I said.

I ran. Not to the surface. I ran *downward*, into the forgotten levels, the unmapped depths, the places where the Grout was cracked and the earth still breathed.

## VI. The Ghost-Digger

Three years.

Three years in the sump-levels of the Gray Grotto, where the Council's infrastructure failed and the water seeped in black sheets down walls that had never known Grout. Three years of becoming a "Ghost-Digger" — performing unauthorised repairs on failing tunnels, patching cracks the Council couldn't afford to acknowledge, learning the language of damaged earth.

I was alone. I was bitter. I was good.

Ghost-Diggers were the Council's guilty secret — necessary, deniable, disposable. Any wombat caught performing structural repairs without certification faced liquidation of assets and mandatory Corvée. But the deeper levels were failing faster than they could repair them.

I learned to read stress-fractures the way other wombats read weather. I could feel a soft spot through three metres of substrate. I knew the difference between a crack that wanted to be healed and a crack that wanted to be left alone. I worked by touch and instinct, filling gaps with gold-dust clay, reinforcing weak points with the Old Ways.

I didn't call it Kintsugi-Mu then. I just knew that some breaks were not meant to be hidden. Some breaks were where the light entered.

I lived in a drainage vault in Sector 12-B — a sealed chamber beneath the main water table, accessible only through a maintenance hatch rusted shut for decades. It was damp. It was cold. It was mine.

And one evening, returning from a repair job, I found a beggar talking to an empty jar.

---

## VII. The Beggar and the Jar

The beggar was ancient. His fur was matted in clumps that spoke of years without grooming. His eyes — when they turned to me — were the colour of old water, of puddles that have forgotten the sky.

"You're early," he said.

"I'm not—" I stopped. The jar was empty, but he held it with both paws, cradling it, as if it contained something precious. "This is my vault."

"Is it?" He smiled, and in that smile was something ancient, something that had once worn robes instead of rags. "Then I must be early. Or late. The jar isn't clear on the distinction."

"Who are you?"

He set the jar down. "The Council calls me Hangbat. The Dingoes call me Howlbaram. The jar calls me... well, the jar doesn't speak as often as it used to." He looked at me, and I felt suddenly that I was being measured, weighed. "You are the listener. The one who still believes the earth has moods."

"How do you know that?"

"Because you are still alive." He gestured to the floor. "Sit. The jar has been waiting for you."

I sat.

"You were at the Academy," he said. Not a question. "Sector 7. The collapse. The two students who became foundation material for the new gymnasium."

"How do you know that?"

"Because I was there." His voice was soft. "Not physically. But in the silence after. I heard the frequency of that silence. The frequency of a young wombat learning that the Council cares more about the appearance of safety than safety itself."

"What do you want?"

"To tell you a story." He picked up the jar. "About the Wombiki. The Dancers. The ones they tell you were martyrs."

"I know about the Wombiki. They sacrificed themselves to anchor the Grout. To keep the Static from rising."

He laughed. It was not happy. "They weren't martyrs. They were prisoners. Addicts. The Council fed them Grout-Honey — a concentrate of processed Frequency, sweet and numbing. They didn't dance into the Grout because they were brave. They danced because they couldn't stop. Because the withdrawal was worse than the entombment."

He set the jar down. In the silence, I could hear water dripping, a rhythm like breathing.

"They sealed them in wet Grout while they were still dancing. They called them 'Soul-Anchors.' They told the population that these dancers gave their lives to protect the colony. They built monuments. And all the while, the Wombiki were suffocating in concrete, their final movements recorded and looped into the Melborow Frequency."

I felt sick. "That's not—"

"True?" His eyes were steady. "Tell me, listener. When you press your ear to the Grout in the Cathedral district, what do you hear?"

"The Frequency. The Council's broadcast."

"And beneath it?"

I'd never thought to listen beneath it. "I don't—"

"Listen now." He placed a paw on the vault floor. "The walls of Melborow are screaming. Every foot of Safety Grout is a mass grave. And the worst part? It doesn't work. The sacrifices don't slow the Static. They never did. The Council continues because hope requires a price, and a wombat who believes their neighbour died to save them will work ten hours longer without complaining about the cracks."

I pressed my ear to the floor. And for the first time, I heard it — beneath the hum of the Frequency, a deeper sound. A vibration. A chorus of voices, muffled, distant, screaming.

I pulled back, gasping. "What is that?"

"The truth." He leaned forward, and in the dim light, I saw that his eyes were not water-coloured at all. They were violet. The colour of jacaranda blooms that grew only in stories. "There was one who tried to speak it aloud. Vara. My student. She tried to expose the lie, and Trumbat murdered her in the Cathedral. Her dying frequency — her final scream — was woven into the Melborow Frequency. They turned her last gasp into the hum that keeps everyone else asleep."

"They didn't just kill her," he said. "They used her fear to pave the city. They turned her last gasp into the lullaby that keeps the colony docile."

---

## VIII. The Golden Join

Hangbat taught me the True Kintsugi-Mu.

Not the Council's version — not the patching, the hiding. The true art: making the fracture the strongest part by filling it with gold. "The break is where the light enters," he said, until the words became part of my paws. "You do not hide the damage. You honour it. You make it luminous."

He taught me to use Gold Dust as a conductor for Arnam — for Empathy. When a wombat mended stone with gold-clay, they were not just repairing the substrate. They were acknowledging that damage was part of the story, not an aberration to be erased.

"The Council pours Grout to hide the cracks," Hangbat said. "They believe that if they cannot see the damage, the damage does not exist. But the earth remembers. The cracks remember."

I felt the difference in my paws. When I worked with Grout, the earth went silent. It became dead material. But when I worked with gold-clay, the earth spoke back. It told me where to press, where the substrate wanted to heal.

"You have the gift," Hangbat said. "The listening. Most wombats lost it generations ago. But you kept it. That is why the jar chose you."

"The jar didn't choose me. You broke into my vault."

"Same thing." He smiled. "The jar isn't clear on the distinction."

---

## IX. The Shattered Gorge

"You must go to the Shattered Gorge," Hangbat said, one evening when the Frequency seemed particularly desperate. "There, the earth still bleeds. There, you will learn the anatomy of the break."

The Gorge was a day's journey through unmapped tunnels — places where the Council's Grout had failed, where the Static had risen and the substrate had shattered like glass. Dangerous. Forbidden. Necessary.

I packed my tools: gold-dust clay, obsidian picks, soft brushes. I packed the jar — Hangbat insisted — though it remained stubbornly empty.

"It will fill when it needs to fill," he said. "Until then, carry the emptiness."

He pressed something into my paw — a vial of violet liquid, thick and luminous.

"The last of the Watcher's Frequency. The only song the Council couldn't digitize. If you find yourself in true darkness, drink it."

I walked into the dark.

---

The Shattered Gorge lived up to its name.

It was a wound in the world — crystalline shards catching the dim light and refracting it into rainbows that had no business existing in a wombat tunnel. The Static was thick here. The air tasted of electricity and old violence.

I found a stable ledge and set down my tools.

And heard the scream.

Not a wombat scream. High, sharp, desperate — something small and terrified and *falling*.

I ran toward it. A fissure in the Gorge wall opened onto a void. And tumbling, wings beating uselessly, was a bird.

A Galah. Young. Its crest raised in terror, claws scrabbling for purchase. It was clutching something — a seed that glowed with faint violet light.

I reached.

My paws found the bird's body, pulled. It struggled, bit, screamed — but I held on, dragged us back from the edge, collapsed with the bird cradled against my chest.

We lay there, panting. The bird's heart was a frantic drum. The violet seed had fallen between us, still glowing, still *alive*.

"Easy," I whispered. "I'm not going to hurt you."

The Galah's eye — bright, intelligent — fixed on me. One wing hung at a wrong angle. Blood matted its chest.

"The seed," it said. "Don't let them take the seed."

"Who?"

I heard it — the whine of Council drones, distant but approaching. Tracking the bird. Tracking the seed.

"They've been following me since the Ridge," the Galah gasped. "Since the Silver Wattle fell. The seed is — it's the only—" It coughed. Blood flecked its beak.

I reached for my gold-dust clay. Not to repair stone this time, but to mend a spirit.

"Hold still," I said. "This will feel strange."

I worked quickly. The gold-dust clay wasn't meant for flesh, but the principles were the same — find the break, honour the break, fill it with light. I packed the clay around the injured wing, not forcing the bones but *asking* them, feeling for the frequency of the break.

The Galah's terror-resonance subsided. The seed seemed to brighten, responding to the gold-dust frequency.

"What is this?" it whispered.

"Kintsugi-Mu," I said. "The golden join."

"I'm Cooroo. From the Eastern Ridge. The Silver Wattle — my home — it shattered. The Static got inside. The tree turned to crystal and then it... exploded."

I'd heard that explosion three days ago — a shudder the Council's sensors had classified as "negligible."

"The seed came from the South. From a Jacaranda. It blooms violet. It processes the Static. Turns it into something soft."

I looked at the seed. It pulsed with a rhythm that matched my own heart. The rhythm the Council's Frequency had tried to drown out.

"The Jacaranda needs a fracture," Cooroo said. "It can't grow in solid Grout. It needs a crack. A wound. That's why they sent me — to find a place where the earth is still broken enough to receive it."

I thought of the Gorge. Of the wounds in the substrate. I thought of Hangbat's words: *The break is where the light enters.*

"I know a place," I said.

---

## X. The Seed and the Promise

We planted the seed in the deepest fissure of the Shattered Gorge.

Not a hole — I'd learned that much. You didn't dig. You *offered*. You found a place where the substrate was already broken, where the earth had done the hard work of opening, and you placed the seed there like a gift.

The fissure ran down into darkness. But the edges were stable. The earth here had broken cleanly. A Compassion Gap. A Soft Spot.

I pressed the seed into the clay. Cooroo — its wing now supported by gold-dust lattice — watched with bright, serious eyes.

"It needs water. And time. And—"

"And someone to tend it," I finished.

I understood now. What Hangbat had been preparing me for. I was not just a repairman. I was a tender of something new. Something that grew in the gaps.

"Will you stay?" Cooroo asked. "When I go back to the Ridge? Someone needs to watch the seed."

I looked at the fissure. At the seed, already seeming to settle into the clay, already seeming to send invisible roots into the dark. I thought of the Groves, of my father, of Barnabat's betrayal, of the walls of Melborow that screamed.

"I'll stay," I said.

Cooroo extended its good wing — the gold-dust lattice catching the light, making the injured limb look almost jewelled, almost *intentional*. "Then we're bound. Kappa Mu. The fellowship of the gap."

"Kappa Mu," I repeated. The words felt ancient. Like something waiting for me to speak it.

The Galah took flight — awkwardly, but flying. It circled once above the fissure, a flash of pink and grey against the crystalline darkness. Then it was gone.

I was alone with the seed.

I sat beside the fissure and pressed my ear to the clay. And for the first time since the Academy, since the collapse, since the years in the sump, I felt the earth speak clearly. Not in words. In vibration. In promise.

The seed was listening.

The seed was ready.

And somewhere, in the darkness beneath Melborow, something was beginning to grow.

*End of Chapter 4*

*In which I learn that the beggar's truth is the earth's truth, that a break can be beautiful, and that some things will only grow where the world has cracked.*
