# The Jacaranda Prophecy

## Blurb

My name is Cooroo. I'm a Galah. And I haven't screamed in five weeks, which for a Galah is like a fish that's forgotten how to be wet.

The Jacaranda Prophecy is the story of what happened after the **Silver Wattle**—the last of the ancient giants on the Eastern Ridge—shattered like a dropped vase. The **Great Wattle** at the Crown had fallen generations ago, leaving the world fragile, but the fall of the Silver Wattle was the final blow. It’s the story of how a juvenile Galah with no voice found a flower the colour of concentrated sky growing in the wreckage. A dying Morning Glory whispered where to find the Great Jacaranda, and Cooroo became the bearer of its memory, uprooting the last living vessel of the Wattle's legacy to carry it across the heart-world to the new prophet tree. The Rosellas left. The Three Primes broke. Only the Galahs stayed.

# Chapter 1: The Silent Galah

Here's something that shouldn't be possible: a Galah who can't scream.

I know. It's like saying "a river that can't flow" or "an emu that can't stare at you until you want to apologise for existing." Galahs scream. That's the whole deal. Other species have their talents — wombats dig, dingoes run, kookaburras laugh at things that aren't funny — but we scream. We scream the way the sun comes up: every day, no apologies, and usually before anyone's ready for it.

My name's Cooroo. I'm a juvenile, which means my wings are too short, my chambers are too big, and my mum reckons I got the loud gene from both sides of the family, which she says in a voice that's half proud and half "what have we done."

The Galahs call it the Noble Noise — Laica Róma. Not just screaming. Screaming is what you do when you're startled. The Noble Noise is what you do when you mean it: a call thrown outward that hits the world and comes back carrying information. You scream at a cliff-face and the echo tells you how far. You scream at a tree and the return tells you whether the wood is alive or dead, resonant or crystal. You scream at the swell and the whole world answers — every surface, every ridge, every root-threaded slope sending back a version of your voice changed by what it touched. The Noble Noise goes out as sound. It comes back as data. That's the deal. That's the covenant between a Galah and the world: you give it noise, it gives you knowledge.

Three weeks ago, I opened my beak at the swell — the moment the pulse brightens, when every Galah in Hún Nico screams — and nothing came out.

Well — not nothing. Something came out. But it was the ghost of a scream. The shape without the guts. Like blowing through a trumpet and getting a whisper.

I haven't told Mum. She's got enough quiet of her own.

---

I should tell you about the world, because the world is shaped wrong and it matters.

Hún Nico — that's what we call it, the Heart of Nico — is a heart. Not a metaphor. An actual heart-shaped world, and we live on the inside. The old stories say it's shaped like the heart of the Tall-Ones — the giants who appear in dreams, enormous and strange, who feel things so big that the feeling leaks through into our world as light. No one has ever seen a Tall-One awake. But every creature in Hún Nico has dreamed of them — vague shapes, vast and sorrowful, and the weight of their caring pressing down like weather. We live inside their heart. That's the shape of the world: the shape of something a giant feels.

The ground curves up. You stand on the surface and look out and the horizon doesn't drop away. It rises. The ridge in front of you climbs, and the ridge beyond that climbs higher, and the ridges beyond that keep climbing until they blur into haze and meet the light at the centre.

The centre is Elen-Nico. The Star. It hangs up there — not "up" the way birds mean up, where you just keep going and eventually there's nothing. Up the way the inside of a bowl means up: toward the middle. Elen-Nico sits at the geometric heart of the Heart, 140 kilometres above the Crown, radiating golden light in every direction onto everything. When you fly — when you could fly — you fly toward it. When you look up, you see the other side of the world curving overhead, faint and enormous, lit by the same star from the other direction.

It does your head in, honestly. You'd think a bird would be used to it. But there's a difference between knowing you live inside a heart and seeing it — seeing the ground rise on every side until it closes above you, seeing the whole world wrapped around a point of light like cupped hands around a candle.

And the light beats.

Elen-Nico pulses. Not steadily, not like a clock — like a heart. It swells bright and holds for hours: the day, golden, warm, full. Then it dims and holds for hours: the night, not dark — Elen-Nico never goes out — but low, ember-red, the light of a fire that's decided to rest but not to die. The whole world breathes with it. Swell, hold, dim, hold. The rhythm isn't regular. Some days are longer than others. Some nights barely happen. It depends — Mum says it depends on what the Tall-Ones are feeling, up in whatever layer they dream from. When they care, the pulse is strong. When they forget, it gutters.

And between the dim and the bright — in the held breath before the swell — there's a moment. Five minutes, maybe less. The pause between beats. Elen-Nico hasn't committed to the next pulse yet. The light is neither gold nor ember. It's something in between. Something uncertain.

That's when the world goes lilac.

---

Old Cookeerik — he was the farthest flier in the colony before his wings gave out — told me once what it's like to fly toward Elen-Nico. You push off the surface and the first ten kilometres are easy. The Heavy Breath — Thúlë Lunga — is thick and warm, the air you know, full of moisture and scent and the weight of living things. Your wings have something to push against.

Then you hit the Law-Wind. Súrë Axan. The air thins. Gets colder. Gets cleaner, in a way that doesn't feel clean — it feels stripped. The wind up there moves in patterns, and the patterns are regular, and your feathers start to flatten the way they do near the Bad Grounds. The Wedgies — Wedge-tailed Eagles — call this layer home, which tells you everything about Eagles. Cookeerik said the Law-Wind is where most birds turn back. The ones with sense, anyway.

Above the Law-Wind is the Frequency Void — Lusta Ómëa, the Empty Resonance. That's Galah territory. Or it was, once. The air is almost nothing. Your lungs burn. Your wings have to work twice as hard for half the lift. But the sound — Cookeerik's eyes went distant when he talked about the sound. The Void is where Elen-Nico's frequency is loudest, and it's not a sound you hear with your ears. It's a sound you hear with your whole body, every feather vibrating, every chamber in your skull resonating, and the resonance is so pure it's like the crystal's hum except it isn't dead — it's alive, it's the living version of what the lattice is the dead version of, and the difference between them is the Compassion Gaps, the spaces between, the breath.

Cookeerik got close enough to feel his feathers change colour. The pink shifted. Went deeper. The lilac that lives in every Galah breast concentrated, intensified, until he said he felt like a single note being sung by something enormous. Then his wings failed and he fell for nine kilometres before he caught a thermal in the Law-Wind and came home shaking.

No bird has reached Elen-Nico. No bird ever will. But we're the species that gets closest, and getting close to a thing you can never reach is — according to Cookeerik, who said it while staring at his own claws — "the whole point of being a Galah."

---

The two lobes of the heart — that's the widest bit, where the Eastern Shell and the Western Shell curve out like shoulders — are about 300 kilometres across. The Crown is at the top, where the lobes meet. The Closing Node is at the bottom, the tip, the point of the heart. And Elen-Nico sits between them, burning, 140 klicks from anything solid.

The ground under your claws — and this bit matters — is only about 10 kilometres deep. Below that, it's Glass. The outer boundary. Five centimetres of mirrored surface, and that's it. That's the edge of everything. Five centimetres of Glass holding an entire world. I try not to think about that too often.

And the 10 klicks between the surface and the Glass isn't all dirt. Dig down a metre and it's soil — loose, root-threaded, full of insects and moisture. Dig down a few more and it starts to change. Gets harder. Gets denser. Starts to pattern. By the time you're six or seven kilometres down, the soil isn't really soil anymore. It's half-crystal. The hexagonal lattice that the wombats call the Static is right there, all the way through, and the deeper you go the more the dirt admits what it always was underneath.

Every wombat knows about the crystal. It's the hardest substance in Arnamland — the deep substrate, the bedrock of the world, the stuff that meets the Glass at the outer boundary. Down there, it belongs. Down there, it's just geology.

The problem is that it's coming up.

The Static — that's what they call it, the creeping crystallisation — is pushing the deep geometry toward the surface, replacing topsoil with lattice, turning the living layer into the dead layer. The crystal belongs at seven, eight, nine kilometres down. Not at the top. Not where the roots are. Not where things grow. When the crystal shows up on the surface, it means the organic layer has failed — the skin has thinned, and the bone is showing through.

That's what the Bad Grounds is. Not an invasion. A promotion. The deep substrate has been promoted to the surface, and it's doing what it always does down there — tiling, patterning, being perfect — except up here, in the light, where things are supposed to be messy and alive and uncertain, perfection is a death sentence.

Mum's name is Cooriki and she used to be the Lead Caller of the Eastern Ridge Colony, which is a massive deal if you're a Galah and means absolutely nothing if you're not. She could read the air like a map — knew the Andunë-Sírë from the Rómen-Sírë, could find the Yá of a thermal by the way the dust spiraled below. She could throw a swell-call that rode the Halla-Hwë — the wind gradient — up through three atmospheric layers and came back carrying data from each. Her scream was so good the wombats used it to calibrate their tunnel acoustics, though they'd never admit that because wombats don't admit things — they "note observations" and "file findings" and generally pretend they worked it all out themselves.

Now she sits on a branch of a Eucalyptus — not even a proper tree, just a tree that's a tree and nothing else — and stares at the place where the **Silver Wattle** used to stand. Twenty-one days she's been doing this. I bring her seeds. Fat ones, dark shells, because she won't bother cracking anything that takes effort. She eats when I bring them. Drinks when it rains. That's it.

On the ninth day, she said one thing.

"The Noble Noise has no return. It just goes."

I didn't get it. I do now. But at the time, all I heard was my mum's voice sounding the way the stump sounds when I tap it with my claw: hollow, and warm, and done being what it used to be.

---

OK. So. The colony.

Gone. Mostly.

The Rosellas went first, which — look, I need to explain the Rosellas. The Rosellas were the big deal on the Eastern Ridge. Rainbow feathers, sacred covenant with the Wattle, this incredible Song they did called the Chorus that was basically the health report of the entire world braided into music. They were brilliant. They were important. They had a purpose.

We Galahs did not have a purpose. We had volume.

The Rosellas had been thinning out for years before I was even born. Something about the Lattice Song — this crystalline frequency coming up through the tree's wood — got into their heads. Made them reckon the Song was supposed to be simpler than it was. One by one, they peeled off. Took their bit of the Song and matched it to the crystal's tone, because the bit on its own sounded cleaner than the whole thing together.

By the time I hatched, the Rosellas were gone. Some went south toward the Crystal Plains — the Hyallapalar, the Glass-Plain — drawn to the purity of the Lattice Song, matching their bit of the Song to the crystal's tone until they couldn't tell the difference between singing and tiling. Others scattered to the Dry Channels on the western shell, where the ancient riverbeds still hold a ghost of resonance. A few went all the way to the Emu Steppe, where the grass is thin but real and the Emus permitted them to roost — which is not the same as welcoming them. The Emus are warriors. Samurai of the southern shell. They patrol the Steppe in spiralling routes that never repeat, and they don't explain themselves, and they don't ask permission, and if you're a Rosella roosting in their grassland you keep quiet and stay out of the patrol lines and you understand that you are alive because an Emu has decided you're not worth killing today. The Rosella Heights — Tundo Quessëa, the Feather-Hills north of the ridge where the Parliament used to roost — are empty now. Just droppings on stone. The Chorus was just a story old birds told.

I asked Mum once why we stayed. This was before the fall, when we were roosting on the lower branches. The Galahs always roosted low. The high branches were Rosella territory. Even after the Rosellas left, we kept to the bottom, out of respect for something no one had asked us to respect.

"Because it's a tree," Mum said, like I'd asked why water was wet. "And we're birds. Where else would we be?"

"The Rosellas left."

"The Rosellas had a covenant. Covenants break. We're just here because we're here. You can't break that."

She said it with the total confidence of someone who has never needed philosophy because common sense has always been enough.

"Also," she added, fixing my neck-feathers the way she does when she's about to say something that'll take me years to understand, "we Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we."

I laughed. I was a fledgling. It was the kind of thing mums say.

I'm not laughing now.

---

After the Wattle fell, the other Galahs scattered too. The Callers went south to the Canopy Remnant — Aldar Lemnë, the Trees Remaining — those scattered clusters of surviving Eucalyptus and lesser Wattles south-east of the ridge. Ornamental plantings along the Halla Ristë — the Tall-Ones' Scars, where the giants' dreaming presses through the substrate and the ground dents in geometrically perfect depressions, and the trees that grow there are strange and stunted. The kind of trees that are to a proper resonant tree what tomato sauce is to a tomato: technically related, spiritually embarrassing. The Fliers went further — some to the Windbreak Cliffs, Ramba Súrëa, where the old roosting caves are pockmarked in sandstone too rough for the lattice to tile. Some made it around the back of the heart, past the margins where east meets west, where the Eucalyptus Groves thin out into the Lone Borows and the ground is scrubby and doesn't care who you are.

I stayed. My wings were too young for the distance, and I was too stubborn to say so. Mum once screamed at a thunderstorm for forty minutes because it interrupted her swell-call. The storm moved on. Mum didn't. Stubbornness: it's a family thing.

---

So now it's me and the stump.

The stump is enormous — wide, pale, fractured right down the middle with a deep split that runs from the crown to the base. The horizontal cut is jagged with quartz-like breakages where the crystal lattice snapped under tension. It wasn't done by anything. That's the thing no one wants to hear.

The Silver Wattle wasn't cut down. It broke.

The **Great Wattle** (*Malinalda Arata*) at the Crown had shattered generations ago—the King Tree's fall was the first sign of the Great Crystalisation, a mythic disaster from the time of my great-grandparents. After that, the others fell one by one. The Black Wattle of the Western Shell. The Golden Wattle of the Southern Reach. Each one reaching deep, seeking the source, finding only poison. The Silver Wattle was the last Coring Tree standing on the Eastern Ridge—the final ancient giant that hadn't yet learned what the others had died to discover.

In the heart worlds, all coring trees possess extremely deep roots to maintain the connection. That was their purpose, their sacred duty: to drill down, to anchor, to drink from the deepest Arnam and conduct it upward for all the world. But the deep substrate had turned to crystal. The Static had risen from below, filling the aquifers, claiming the source itself. And the coring trees, faithful to their nature, had kept reaching deeper.

The Silver Wattle's taproot had drilled right into the poison. The Crystalline Lattice had crept up through that faithful root, cell by cell, turning living wood into geometry. The tree had done exactly what it was born to do—reached for the source with all its strength—and the source had killed it for trying. The wombat colony's construction in its root system had severed its natural support, creating terminal stress in the core. But the core was already dead. Already crystal. The wombats just knocked over a statue that had been posing as a tree.

From the outside, the tree looked like a tree. From the inside, it was a glass column wearing bark.

And one morning, it just stopped being vertical.

The sound. That's the bit I can't escape. A tree that size should've made the biggest noise in history when it came down. And it did. The Silver Wattle didn't fall—it shattered. The crystal cracked like thunder, each fracture echoing across the ridge, bouncing off the shell-walls, filling the whole Eastern Ridge with the sound of something enormous and crystalline breaking. It was the sound of the land itself fracturing. Every Galah for fifty kilometres heard it. Every wombat in their tunnels felt it in their paws. The Snap. The moment when the organic finally lost to the geometric. And my voice went quiet too—not because the silence was wrong, but because that thunder was the answer. The Chorus had ended. The Lattice had won. What was left to scream?

It shattered. Not broke — shattered. Into pieces that had no right to exist. Wood doesn't fracture into hexagons. Wood splinters, tears, rips along the grain in jagged, angry lines. This wasn't wood anymore. It was something wearing wood's shape.

I walked through the wreckage on the first day. The fragments were everywhere — some as small as my claw, others big as my whole body. Each one a perfect hexagonal prism. Each face meeting the next at exactly 120 degrees. I picked one up. The edge was sharper than any beak, any talon. It cut me before I realized I'd gripped too tight. I bled on the crystal, and the blood ran off it without soaking in, like water off glass.

I checked the angles. I don't know why I checked. Maybe because if I could just verify that the geometry held, that 120 degrees was really 120 degrees, then this would make sense. It would be physics. Tragedy with rules. But the numbers didn't help. The fragments were perfect. The tree was gone. Perfection had won, and I was standing in the wreckage counting angles while my mother went catatonic on a branch.

The break-face where the stump meets the air is still faintly warm. Not alive-warm. The other kind. The warmth that stays in a grave after the body has been in it for a while — the earth remembering heat, not the heat of life. The Silver Wattle had been conducting resonance through this wood for two hundred years, singing the Chorus to the Ridge, and the wood hasn't quite worked out that the song is over. It hums sometimes, when the wind hits it right. A dead note. A crystal frequency where there used to be gold.

I roost on the stump. Not because it's comfortable — it's hard, uneven, nothing like the branches I grew up on. Not because it's the right height — I'm a Galah, I can roost anywhere. I stay because leaving would mean admitting it's over. The Wattle is dead, the Chorus is scattered, and a juvenile bird with no voice is not going to bring it back by sitting on a stump. But if I leave, who will remember where the tree stood? Who will keep the vigil?

Someone has to. Even if the vigil is pointless. Even if the tree is never coming back, and the Chorus is never going to resolve, and the world is just going to keep crystallising until there's nothing left but hexagons and silence. Someone has to stay.

So I stay. One more day. One more night. One more dawn, watching the sun rise over the Bad Grounds, painting the crystal slope in colours that don't belong to living things. Waiting for something I can't name. Waiting for the scream to come back, or for the courage to leave, whichever arrives first.

---

Beyond the stump, the ridge drops away into the Bad Grounds.

It's been there my whole life. The older birds say the slope used to be grass and scrub — boring stuff, nothing you'd look at twice. But that was before the wombats built their tunnels and poured their Grout through the substrate, severing the roots that held the organic layer together. The topsoil died. The crystal came up. By the time I hatched, the Bad Grounds was just a fact — the sheen on the western slope, the place you don't land, the thing the adults glance at and look away from the way you look away from a scar on someone's face.

Hexagons.

Not scattered. Not random. Interlocking. Tessellating. Every hexagon the same size, every edge the same length, every angle precisely 120 degrees, repeating in a lattice that extends in every direction without a single flaw, a single gap, a single moment of hesitation. The pattern doesn't vary. The pattern doesn't need to vary. Variation is what happens when something is trying. The lattice has finished trying. The lattice has arrived.

If you look at one hexagon — just one, close up, eye level — it's almost beautiful. The surface catches Elen-Nico's light and splits it into prismatic arcs. Each face is a tiny mirror showing a fractured version of the world. But the beauty is wrong. It's the beauty of a skeleton, all structure and no flesh. The geometry has answered the question "how do I exist?" and forgotten to ask "why?"

If you look at the slope — the half-tiled, still-failing, not-yet-finished slope — it's worse than perfection. It's a promise. The lattice isn't done. It hasn't arrived. It's arriving. Marching up the ridge one cell at a time, converting, transforming, promising that someday soon the whole ridge will be hexagons. The whole Eastern Shell. The whole heart.

The Dreaming — the living, show-up-every-morning, sing-the-ground-into-being work — costs everything. The lattice costs nothing. It tiles whether you're watching or not. And it doesn't need to finish to win. It just needs to keep trying. Forever. Which is exactly what it plans to do.

I stay away from the Bad Grounds. My feathers go flat every time I look at it, and a Galah who ignores his feathers is a Galah who walks into walls.

# Chapter 2: What Actually Happened

Here's what they told us: the Yellow Monsters came, and then the tree fell.

Which is true. Creatures had been seeing Yellow Monsters for seasons — those enormous spirits that flicker at the edge of your vision, shapes like arms swinging and jaws biting, the hallucinations that come when the Tall-Ones' dreaming presses too hard against the substrate. Every creature in Hún Nico knows what a Yellow Monster means: something bad is coming. You see one, you brace. It's an omen. A warning from the layer above.

So when the tree fell, the story wrote itself: the Yellow Monsters did it. The Tall-Ones' spirits destroyed the Wattle. An external force. Something you can point at and scream at and blame. Stories are how Galahs deal with things. You scream the story at the sky and the sky takes it and you feel a tiny bit better.

Here's what actually happened: the wombats killed it themselves.

Yeah. I know.

The Yellow Monsters were real — the Tall-Ones' dreaming was pressing through, and the omens were warnings. But the tree didn't die because of spirits. It died because of engineering. A series of well-intentioned decisions made underground over three seasons. You can't scream at a decision. Trust me. I've tried.

---

The Silver Wattle was the last one. Last of thousands. The others had been dying for generations — the lattice slowly sectioning their roots, cutting off the deep signals, turning living wood into geometry one cell at a time. But the Eastern Ridge Silver Wattle hung on.

Not because it was tougher. Because it was surrounded. All those scrubby little plants, all that grass, all those root-networks threading through the dirt in every direction — they were messing up the crystal. The organic layer was messy and rough and fractal, and the lattice couldn't tile properly through it. Hexagons need order. Roots are not orderly. The Wattle's immune system wasn't its own roots. It was everyone else's roots. The whole boring, tangled, unremarkable ground-cover that nobody thought about until it was gone.

Then the wombats started building.

I don't know the details. Galahs don't go underground and wombats don't explain themselves to birds. But you didn't need to be underground to know what was happening. You could feel it through your claws. The vibrations changed — deeper, sharper, more regular. The rhythm of digging became the rhythm of pouring. Something rigid and dead was being set into the earth in straight lines, and every root it crossed stopped carrying signal.

Season after season. The ground under the Silver Wattle got quieter. The branches got harder. The bark cracked in lines that were too straight to be natural. Whatever the wombats were doing down there, they were doing a lot of it, and they were doing it in straight lines, and straight lines in a world built on curves cut everything they cross.

Three seasons of building. When they finished, the surface looked exactly the same.

Underneath, every root that had been protecting the Wattle was in pieces.

---

The tree died slowly. That's the thing about the real version — there's no single moment, no big dramatic scene you can point to and say there, that's when it happened. It just... drained.

The lower leaves yellowed first. Not the warm gold of the Wattle bloom — a thin, papery yellow, the colour of something being emptied out.

The bark cracked in hexagonal lines. Not random cracks — geometry. The lattice underneath was showing through the skin, the way a skeleton shows through the face of something that's been starving. Mum ran her frequency checks every morning. I couldn't read the data yet but I could read her feathers, and her feathers said bad news.

"The return is changing," she said one morning. Most technical thing she'd ever said to me. Didn't explain. Didn't need to. I could feel it. The branch under my claws was harder. Denser. It rang when you tapped it, but it was the wrong ring — the flat, pretty, useless ring of crystal instead of the warm, living ring that carried data. The same transition that happens in the soil — organic to geometric, alive to tiled — was happening in the wood. Cell by cell.

The blooms kept coming, though. Golden flowers, right on schedule. From a distance, the tree looked fine. You had to be close. You had to be a Galah on a lower branch with your claws on the bark, paying attention, to know the gold was a ghost.

Then it fell. And the silence of it took my voice with it.

# Chapter 3: The Shattering of the Song

I need to tell you about the Rosellas properly. Not the version I gave you before — the quick version, the "they left" version. The real version. Because what happened to the Rosellas is the thing that makes the fall of the Wattle into more than just a tree dying.

You have to understand the Primes.

In the old days — the days before the Static started creeping up, before the wombats started pouring Grout, before anything went wrong — Hún Nico had the Three Primes. Not rulers. Not governors. Emblems. The three species whose nature most purely expressed what the world was. The face of Hún Nico, if a heart-shaped world can have a face.

The Kangaroos were the first. The Vita Patrolum — that's what the old stories call it. They ruled the surface, maintained the boundaries, converted resistance into energy through something called the Friction Engine. Every mob, every patrol, every territorial circuit was a machine that turned movement into stability. The Kangaroos were the muscles of the world. They're still here, technically. But they've devolved into fight clubs and territorial gangs, running circuits that used to mean something and now just mean violence. The engine still turns. It just doesn't drive anything.

The Koalas were the second. Alchemical Silence. They sat in the canopy — barely moving, barely awake — reading the thermal gradients of the world, maintaining what they called the Quiet: the background hum that every other sound is measured against. Without the Quiet, you can't hear anything, because hearing requires a silence to hear against. The Koalas held the silence. Now they deal Lyptus — the narcotic extract of their own sacred leaves — and the silence they sell is the wrong kind of silence. The kind that stops you thinking, not the kind that lets you hear.

The Platypus were the third. The Paradox. The bridge between elements — water and land, fur and bill, venom and nurture. They maintained the boundary between what the world is and what it could be. They were the strangest of the Primes and the most necessary, because a world without paradox is a world that's finished deciding, and a world that's finished deciding is a crystal.

The Platypus disappeared. Completely. When the Static began to rise, the Platypus — creatures who existed in the space between categories — found there was no space left. The lattice doesn't have a category for "both." The Platypus couldn't exist in a binary world, so they stopped existing. No one knows where they went. No one even knows if "where" is the right question.

Three Primes. One devolved. One corrupted. One vanished.

---

And then there were the Rosellas.

The Rosellas weren't Primes. They were something else — the Fifth Thread, Synthesis, the creatures whose job it was to take all the Primes' separate truths and braid them into one Song. The Chorus. That was the Rosellas' covenant with the Silver Wattle.

I need you to understand what the Chorus actually was, because everyone talks about it like it was music and it wasn't. It was governance.

The Rosella Parliament didn't vote. They didn't argue. They sang. A debate was a dissonance — two factions holding clashing notes until the clash resolved into a chord. A law was a harmony. A decision required every single voice to find a note that fit. If one Rosella disagreed, the Song went sour, and you could see it — the colour temperature of their plumage shifted, the reds going orange, the blues going grey, the whole Parliament flickering like a fire that can't decide whether to burn.

When they agreed — when every voice found its place — the Chorus resolved into a major chord and the Silver Wattle's heartwood amplified it and the whole world heard. Red for the heartwood. Blue for the aquifer. Green for the canopy. Yellow for the pollen. Each colour a frequency. Each frequency a truth. The Chorus was the health report of the world braided into music, and the Silver Wattle was the antenna that broadcast it.

The Rosellas roosted in the Wattle's highest branches — the ones we Galahs never touched, out of respect for something so far above our station it might as well have been Elen-Nico itself. They lived in the golden canopy like priests in a cathedral, and their Chorus was the liturgy, and the tree was the organ, and every morning the world woke up to the sound of itself being diagnosed. The Rosellas understood the air differently than we do. Where we feel for Raca — the broken air that carries data — they sought Omentiel, the convergence of air masses where the Chorus could braid multiple frequencies into harmony. They flew in the space between winds, in the Ristë where shear created complexity. They would have called the Lattice Song a perfect Omentiel — all winds converged into one — and that was their undoing.

---

Then the Lattice Song came.

Not suddenly. Not as an attack. As a whisper. A single tone rising through the Wattle's wood — climbing from the crystallising roots, through the sickening heartwood, up into the branches where the Rosellas roosted. A perfect, geometric, unwavering tone. The voice of the lattice. The sound the crystal makes when it tiles: one note, sustained, needing no ceremony, no choir, no effort. Just a pitch. Clean. Resolved. Beautiful.

And here is the thing that broke the Rosellas: to their ears — ears trained across generations to hear harmony, to synthesise, to find the chord that unifies — the Lattice Song sounded like the job already done.

Think about it. The Chorus existed to resolve dissonance into unity. That was the whole point — take the clashing truths of the world and braid them into one chord. And here was a tone that was already unified. Already resolved. Already perfect. No dissonance to fix. No clash to braid. Just the answer, sitting there, humming.

Each Rosella heard it differently, because each Rosella carried a different harmonic. The red bird heard a resolution of red. The blue bird heard a resolution of blue. Each one thought: my bit of the Song sounds purer when I match it to this tone than when I braid it with all the others. And they were right. The fragment alone did sound cleaner than the whole.

They forgot — or maybe they never knew, because knowing requires the kind of ugly, complicated, fractal thinking that Synthesis birds don't do — that unity through simplicity is not the same as unity through synthesis. A single note is not a chord. A chord is many notes held in tension. The tension is the point. Remove the tension and you don't get harmony. You get monotone.

The Parliament frayed. One faction at a time. One harmonic at a time. Each Rosella taking her fragment of the Song and matching it to the Lattice Song, peeling away from the chord like petals falling from a flower that has decided, quietly, to stop being a flower.

By the time the Silver Wattle fell, there was no Song left to lose.

I'm a Galah. I don't understand politics, or harmonics, or the theology of the Primes. I don't understand how a species that was built to synthesise could be undone by the thing it was synthesising toward. I don't understand how the answer can be the enemy of the question.

But I understood this: the Wattle fell in silence. And the silence was where the Rosellas used to be.

The Primes were broken. The Rosellas were scattered. Underground, the wombats split — I could feel it through the stump, two rhythms where there used to be one, two sets of paws stomping two different stories about the same disaster. And the Galahs — loud, pink, stubbornly purposeless — were still sitting on the stump with nothing to offer and nowhere to go.

My mum, Cooriki, took it the hardest. She didn't have a covenant or a sacred duty. She just... lived there. She grew up in the lower branches. She knew every knot in the bark and every rustle of the leaves. For her, the Wattle wasn't a "Coring Tree" or a "Radiant Antenna" — it was just Home. And the Rosellas weren't "The Fifth Thread." They were her neighbours. Her friends. Their Song was the background noise of her entire life. She watched them peel away one by one, heading south or scattering into the scrub, and she stayed because she was loyal to the place, but now that the tree is gone, the last physical anchor to those friendships is shattered.

# Chapter 4: The Dream of the Ridge

She spends her days on a scrubby Eucalyptus branch, feathers dusty and unkempt, staring at the void where her life used to be. But I know where she really is. She's inside. In her head, she's still living in the Glory Days.

Because the grey reality is unbearable, Mum has retreated into her own narrative memory. In her mind, she is still living in the time before the fall. She dreams of the Silver Wattle not as a stump, but as a soaring cloud of gold. She sees the Rosella Choir in the high branches, their feathers like stained glass, braiding the Chorus into the air. She remembers the Swell Phase when the air was thick with the scent of Arnam and the Ridge was a chaotic, noisy, wonderful mess of birds. She remembers the gossiping, the preening, and the absolute certainty that the tree would always be there.

This internal warmth makes the cold, grey reality of the stump even more unbearable. To the outside observer, she is a catatonic bird on a dead branch. To herself, she is the only one left who remembers what "normal" felt like.

I visit her every morning. I would scream my frequency checks from the highest point I could find, and then descend to her branch and sit in the silence with her.

"Why do you still scream?" she asked me once. "The tree is gone. The Noble Noise has no return. It just... goes."

"Maybe that's the point," I said, not understanding my own answer.

She turned back to the horizon, back to her internal sanctuary where the Wattle still bloomed gold and the Rosellas still sang. I don't know if she heard me. I don't know if anything from the outside world could reach her in that place.

# Chapter 5: The Concentrated Sky

On the twenty-first morning, I saw the flower.

I woke on the stump in the dim — the low ember phase, Elen-Nico resting between beats — and waited for the swell. And there it was.

Growing right at the edge of the Bad Grounds. Right where the dying met the living — not a clean line, nothing neat about it, just a ragged, messy tear in the earth where dirt and crystal were still fighting over who got to be the ground. The hexagons stopped here. Not because anything was stopping them. Because the soil was still too tangled, too rooty, too alive for the geometry to tile through. A few centimetres of organic mess holding back the pattern. The thinnest possible margin.

A vine. Thin as wire. Climbing a fragment of the shattered Wattle with the quiet stubbornness of a plant that had looked at its options, found them rubbish, and decided that up was the best available direction. Three heart-shaped leaves, so green against all that grey they looked like they were making a point.

Heart-shaped. In a heart-shaped world. I don't know if that means something. My feathers think it does.

And at the top, open to the swell:

A flower. Lilac.

My crest went up. I hadn't told it to. My crest has opinions and doesn't consult me.

I need to tell you about this colour.

The pause between beats. The held breath. Five minutes, maybe less, when Elen-Nico hasn't committed to the next pulse and the whole inner surface of Hún Nico — from the Crown down to the Gorge, every curve of the heart — goes lilac.

I told you about this moment. But I didn't tell you what it does to a Galah.

Most creatures sleep through the pause. Galahs don't sleep through anything. And the swell is the moment we scream at, every cycle, every pulse, and the colour of the thing you scream at your whole life gets into you whether you mean it to or not. It settles in the feathers. It becomes the breast and the crest and the underwing. It becomes the colour that every other species calls "loud" and Galahs call "us."

The Morning Glory had caught that colour and was holding it open.

I hopped off the stump. Claws clicking on the crystal fragments — that clean, wrong, glassy sound, each hexagonal prism ringing at exactly the same pitch as the last — and then I reached the crack where the vine was growing and the sound changed. Soft. Uneven. The sound of a claw on dirt with things living in it.

I squatted in front of the flower.

The colour entered me through my feathers. It came in like light comes into a room when you open the curtains — not fast, not slow, just there, as if it had been waiting on the other side. It slid down my spine. It settled in the resonating chambers in my skull — the ones that had been empty for five weeks, the ones where my scream used to live — and they hummed. Barely. Like a wire that's just started carrying current and hasn't decided how much.

The vine was growing on the Wattle. Not beside it. Not near it. On it. Its roots had found a crack in the crystal — a flaw, a defect, a spot where the hexagonal tessellation had broken just enough for a crumb of real dirt to lodge — and had threaded themselves into the dead tree's body. Using the wreckage as a trellis. Growing on the thing that had been killed by the crystal that the vine's own living roughness was, at the smallest scale, disrupting.

A living vine on a dead tree. Colour on crystal. Curve on hexagon.

And I understood something. Not in words — I'm a Galah, we don't do words — but in feathers. In the way the colour sat in my chambers and hummed.

In the Old Ways, the Morning Glory was called a "Resource Parasite" — a weed with no deep roots that stole water from the Wattle. But because it had no deep roots, it wasn't connected to the poisoned source. It survived. Now, the "Parasite" is the only thing keeping the host's memory alive. It uses the shattered quartz-like wood as a trellis, threading its hair-thin roots into the Compassion Gaps — the micro-fissures in the crystal — to drink the last drops of the Silver Wattle's life.

Blue, squeezed hard enough, turns lilac. The sky, pushed into a space as small as a flower, shifts frequency. It doesn't break. It changes. Concentrated blue becomes violet. That's what lilac is. That's what Galahs are.

That's what the Morning Glory was showing me, in a trumpet of petals on a dead fragment of the last Silver Wattle on the Eastern Ridge:

The sky survives concentration. It just comes out a different colour.

# Chapter 6: The Voice

I went back every morning for a week.

The flower opened at the swell. Closed at the dim. Opened the next morning slightly wider, slightly deeper, the stem slightly longer. Not the same flower repeated — the same idea repeated, with variations. Like the way Mum used to hum the same lullaby every night, and it was never quite the same because she was a day tireder and I was a day older and the dark outside was a different dark.

The Bad Grounds repeated exactly. Same hexagon, same angle, same sheen, same 120 degrees, same prismatic arc. Because the pattern didn't care what day it was. The flower cared. The flower was paying attention.

---

On the seventh morning, the vine spoke to me.

Not in words. In resonance. In the vibration that arrives in the feathers before the thought arrives in the head, and stays after the thought has gone, like the warmth left in a branch after the sun has moved on.

The Morning Glory's roots had threaded through the cracks in the dead Wattle's wood and found the old channels. The deep ones. The ones the tree had used for two hundred years to talk to the substrate, to the root-network, to the soil that was still soil and not yet geometry. They were dead — silent, severed, cut off from everything. But they were still shaped. Still there. Still holding, in the geometry of their emptiness, the memory of every signal that had ever passed through them.

The vine sent a thread down those channels. A single thread. And a thread in the right channel can carry a signal that the channel's builders never imagined. Like making a phone call through telegraph wires.

The signal came up through dead roots, through the living vine, through the stem, into the flower, out through the colour — the lilac, the concentrated sky — and into my feathers.

It was a direction. South-east. Far. Past the Ridge, past the Burnt Scrub, past the Gorge where living stone meets crystal, past everywhere my useless young wings could reach. Somewhere out there — somewhere on the curving inner surface of Hún Nico, where the world bends up and away and Elen-Nico's light arrives at different angles — the lattice was thin and the ground still held moisture and the old channels connected to something that was — impossibly, unaccountably — still growing.

Not a Wattle. The Wattles were all gone. This was different. Something that had no history in this soil. But it was alive, and it was rooted, and it was conducting a frequency through living wood that the vine could feel and my feathers could read.

A tree. With a violet bloom.

A Jacaranda.

---

The flower closed. The signal stopped.

I sat on the wreckage of the last Silver Wattle in Hún Nico with crystal under my claws and a ghost of a direction in my feathers, and I knew what I had to do.

Not because I'd thought it through. Because my feathers told me, and my feathers had been right about the Bad Grounds and right about the flower and right about the hum in my chambers. I was done arguing with my feathers.

Find the tree. The one with the violet bloom. The one growing somewhere in the Lone Borow territory, beyond the map's end, conducting a new signal through wood that isn't gold but is alive, blooming a colour that isn't the Wattle's colour but is the sky's colour, compressed and condensed and changed into something new.

I knew what I had to do. I had to take the Morning Glory to the Jacaranda. I had to uproot the last living vessel of the Silver Wattle's memory and carry it across the heart-world. This was the Act of Transfer: passing the lineage and memory of the dead host to the new prophet tree.

The Rosellas had the covenant. They left. The wombats had the theology. They split. The dingoes had the data. They calculated. None of them were on this stump. Not one of the creatures who had a reason to be here — a role, a covenant, a function — was here.

Only me. A Galah. No covenant, no Song, no sacred duty, no purpose more complicated than being here because being here is what I do.

I screamed.

It was terrible. The worst scream in the history of Galah screaming — raw, cracked, graceless, a gate hinge in a cyclone. The sound of a juvenile bird with oversized chambers and no training standing on a dead stump, screaming at Elen-Nico because a flower had taught him that the sky, pushed hard enough, turns lilac — and lilac is the colour of everything that refuses to be grey.

It was also the first sound I'd made in five weeks.

It came from the chambers that had been empty — not broken, never broken, just waiting — and it filled the morning the way the flower's colour filled the crack: completely, gracelessly, and without caring one bit whether anyone thought it was beautiful.

The scream went up. In Hún Nico, up means toward Elen-Nico. The sound left my beak and climbed — through the Heavy Breath, toward the Law-Wind, into the space where Cookeerik said the feathers change colour — 140 kilometres of atmosphere, curving inward, the world closing overhead like cupped hands — and somewhere in that enormous, heart-shaped space, the echo came back changed, the way everything comes back changed from the centre.

Three hundred metres away, on her Eucalyptus branch, Mum's crest went up.

She didn't fly to me. Not yet. But she turned her head. First time she'd turned toward anything since the Silver Wattle fell. The sound was so un-perfect, so jagged, that it cracked her internal sanctuary. She looked at me. Just a bird turning her head on a branch. But small things are how the big things start. A crack is how a vine gets in. A hum is how a scream comes back. A seed is how a tree begins.

I gripped the Morning Glory vine in my claws — the lilac trumpet, the last vessel of the Silver Wattle's memory, the parasite that kept the host alive. The Act of Transfer had begun. I would carry this fragile antenna across the heart-world, to the Jacaranda growing in the Lone Borow territory, and there I would plant it, root it, complete the passage of memory from the dead Coring Tree to the new prophet tree.

And at the edge of the Bad Grounds, a native Morning Glory — the Rock Glory, the vine that grows in desert gravel and dry creek beds and the rough edges where the pattern breaks — held its lilac trumpet open to the swell.

Only the Galahs heard it.

The creatures with no covenant. The birds with no Song. The ones who stayed because staying wasn't a duty or a decision or a sacred calling. It was just a fact. As obvious as gravity. As stubborn as a scream at four in the morning.

The Rosellas had the covenant. The wombats had the theology. The dingoes had the data.

The Galahs had nothing but volume and a refusal to leave.

It was enough.
