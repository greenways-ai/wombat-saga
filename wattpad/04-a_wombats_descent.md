# A Wombat's Descent

## Chapter 1: The Dreamer

The first thing I remember is the smell of damp earth and stringybark.

Not Melborow earth — not the compacted, grouted, council-approved substrate that smells of nothing because nothing is exactly what the Council wants it to smell of. Real earth. Eucalyptus Groves earth. The kind that gets under your claws and stays there for days, the kind that has opinions about the weather, that softens when it rains and hardens when it's dry and holds the scent of every creature that's ever walked across it like a guest book written in chemistry.

We lived in a traditional burrow on the margin. The Eucalyptus Groves — that thin strip of surviving bushland where the eastern and western shells of Hún Nico meet, where thirty-seven stringybarks still drew water from a fault line in the bedrock and the air tasted of eucalyptus oil and something older. Memory, maybe. The Groves were a marginal zone in every sense — geographically peripheral, socially invisible, economically irrelevant to the ledgers of QueensBorrow and the Cathedral. The High-Noses pretended we didn't exist, which suited us fine.

Mum's name was Cornelibat.

She'd been a Root-Counter once — an official auditor of the Fixed Borow authority, monocle and all, someone who measured soil in columns and debt in tonnes. Then she'd done something the system couldn't forgive: she'd seen value in a living thing that the ledger had no column for. She'd shown compassion where compassion wasn't budgeted. They stripped her monocle and exiled her to the "Wider Arnam," which is the Council's polite way of saying *we're throwing you away but we'd like you to feel spiritual about it.*

She never told me this directly. I learned it the way you learn most important things in a wombat household — through the architecture of what isn't said. Through the way she flinched when anyone mentioned the Fixed Borow. Through the rigid orthodoxy she wore like armour afterward, the desperate need to prove she was still respectable, still structural, still a creature who could be trusted with load-bearing responsibilities. She'd been burned once for feeling too much. She spent the rest of her life making sure the temperature never rose again.

But at night, when the Frequency dimmed and the Groves went quiet and the stringybarks creaked in the dark like old creatures settling into sleep — at night, she told me stories.

Not Council stories. Not the official narratives of Trum-Bat's brave Grout-Layers who paved the world in safety. She told me about the Dust-Bearers.

The original soil-tenders. The wombats who came before the Grout, before the Safety Geometry, before the ledgers and the sections and the numbered codes. The ones who packed earth with their bare paws and understood — not through calculation but through touch — which soil wanted to hold and which had given up. The Dust-Bearers didn't pour Grout. They listened. They pressed their forefeet into substrate and felt the vibration, the pulse, the geological murmur that told them whether the ground beneath their claws was alive or dying.

"They didn't fix the earth, Hoebat," she'd whisper, one paw smoothing the fur behind my ear. "They tended it. The way you tend a garden. The way you tend a fire. You don't control it. You serve it."

I'd lie in my burrow-nook, the damp earth pressing cool against my back, and close my eyes and feel the vibration she was describing. Not imagining it. Feeling it. The slow pulse of the substrate beneath our burrow, the deep geological heartbeat that the Groves still carried because the Council's Grout hadn't reached this far. It was real. It was there. You just had to be still enough, quiet enough, small enough to notice.

Other kids played Grout-Tag in the cleared zones — chasing each other across grouted surfaces, sliding on the smooth synthetic finish, pretending to be Trum-Bat's engineers. I went to the backyard and pressed my ear to the dirt.

I was listening for the earth.

I didn't know the word for what I wanted to be. Not then. But the feeling was clear as clay: I didn't just want to dig. I wanted to *mend*.

## Chapter 2: The Academy

The Sector 7 Academy of Structural Compliance smelled of Safety Grout and fluorescent lighting.

Two things that have no business being in the same sentence as "education," but there they were: the chemical tang of synthetic sealant and the humming pallor of Muskbat's Glow-Panels, buzzing at a frequency designed to keep young wombats alert, compliant, and incurious. The Academy sat in the mid-levels of the Gray Grotto, a warren of right-angled classrooms bored into the substrate with the precision and warmth of a tax return.

I hated it.

The curriculum was Safety Grout Geometry and Static-Logic. They taught us that the earth was dead material — a problem to be solved, a variable to be controlled, a surface to be sealed against its own inconvenient tendency to shift, breathe, and remember. They taught us the Grout tables: ratios, cure times, tensile strengths, load-bearing calculations for every substrate classification from Type A (compliant) to Type F (resistant). They taught us that a properly grouted tunnel was a triumph of civilisation over chaos, a victory of the engineered over the organic.

They never once mentioned the Dust-Bearers.

"The earth," Mr. Carbat intoned, tapping his pointer against a cross-section diagram of a regulation tunnel, "does not have preferences. The earth does not have moods. The earth is substrate. It is material. Our job is to impose structure upon it."

I sat in the back row and felt my paws itch. Because the earth beneath the classroom floor was humming. Not loudly — the Grout muffled it, the way cotton muffles a heartbeat — but it was there. A low, slow vibration that the Academy's foundation hadn't quite managed to silence. I could feel it through my seat, through my hindquarters, through the thick pads that Mum said were "too sensitive for a boy your age." The substrate under Sector 7 was unhappy. Not structurally compromised — unhappy. A distinction the curriculum did not recognise.

Barna saved me from going mad.

He sat two rows ahead, a stocky, cheerful wombat with a nose that always seemed to be pointing at food and a laugh that carried through tunnels the way water carries through limestone — finding every crack, filling every void. Barna didn't care about Safety Grout Geometry. He cared about digging. Real digging. The old kind, where you felt your way forward with your paws and the tunnel went where the earth wanted it to go, not where the diagram said.

"Behind the gym," he whispered one morning, sliding a crude map across the desk. "There's tunnels. Unauthorised. No Grout. No permits. Just dirt."

I looked at the map. It was drawn on the back of a Static-Logic worksheet, which felt appropriate.

"You in?" he said.

I was in.

---

The unauthorised tunnels behind the gym were the happiest place in Sector 7.

A half-dozen of us would slip away during lunch, squeezing through a crack in the service wall that the maintenance crew hadn't bothered to seal because it was in the wrong part of the Academy — the part that faced the lower levels, the part the High-Noses didn't inspect. We'd drop into the old substrate and dig.

No permits. No diagrams. No ratios or cure times or load-bearing calculations. Just paws and dirt and the ancient, exhilarating conversation between a wombat and the ground. We dug the way Mum's stories described — feeling for roots, following the grain of the soil, letting the earth suggest the tunnel's path instead of imposing one. We found chambers where the substrate was soft and damp and smelled of deep water, and we'd sit in them with our eyes closed and our paws flat on the floor, feeling the vibration, the geological pulse that the Academy pretended didn't exist.

Barna had a theory. "The earth is alive," he'd say, packing a wall with his bare palms, grinning. "It talks. The Grout is just a muzzle."

We were happy. We were idiots. We were twelve.

---

## Chapter 3: The Collapse

The tremor came during fifth period on a Tuesday.

Not a big one — Melborow gets micro-tremors weekly, the substrate adjusting to the weight of the city the way a body adjusts to a burden. Most creatures don't even notice. The Academy's structural sensors registered a 2.1 on the Grout Scale, which is categorised as "negligible" and filed under "No Action Required."

We noticed.

We were in the unauthorised tunnels — Barna, me, and three others whose names I've spent years trying not to remember because remembering them means remembering what happened next. The tremor hit, and the ungrouted ceiling gave way.

Not everywhere. Not all at once. The collapse was surgical — a section of roof maybe four meters wide, where the substrate had been weakened by water seepage from the Academy's relief drains overhead. The drains the maintenance crew should have cleared. The drains that were in the wrong part of the building, in the part that faced the lower levels, in the part nobody inspected.

Clay fell. Dust exploded. The other three scrambled back through the crack in the service wall, screaming. I couldn't see them through the cloud. I could hear Barna.

He was on the other side.

"Hoebat!" His voice was high. Tight. The voice of a twelve-year-old who has just discovered that dirt can kill you. "I can't — it's on my leg — I can't—"

The secondary roof was groaning. I could hear it — not with my ears but with my paws, through the substrate, the deep vibration of stressed clay deciding whether to hold or let go. The ceiling had maybe thirty seconds before it committed to the decision the Academy's sensors had classified as "negligible."

I didn't run. I didn't calculate load-bearing ratios or consult a Static-Logic table. I pressed my ear to the wall of fallen clay and I listened.

Mum's stories. The Dust-Bearers. *They didn't fix the earth. They listened.*

The stress-fracture was three centimetres to my left — a hairline weakness in the collapse wall where the clay hadn't fully compacted, where a pocket of air was trapped between the fallen material and the standing substrate. The Soft Spot. The Compassion Gap. The place where the earth, even in its violence, had left a door ajar.

I dug. Not with math. With instinct. With the thirty-thousand-year-old knowledge that lives in a wombat's forepaws and doesn't need a curriculum to express itself. I felt the clay part around my claws, felt the air pocket open, felt Barna's paw reaching through the gap.

I pulled him out.

The secondary roof came down behind us like a fist closing.

We lay on the tunnel floor, panting, covered in clay, alive. Barna's leg was bruised but unbroken. I'd saved him. I'd saved my best friend using the Old Ways — using the knowledge the Academy said was superstition, using the paws they said were too sensitive, using the instinct they said didn't exist.

I was twelve years old and I was a hero and I thought the world would notice.

## Chapter 4: The Silencing

The next day, there was no assembly. No medal.

There was a chair in the Principal's office, and in it, I sat. The Principal — a Fixed Borow wombat named Sektorbat whose fur was the colour of institutional carpet — stood behind his desk. He wasn't alone.

Vitabat was there.

I knew the name before I knew the face. Vitabat — the Enforcer. The Sovereign of Investment and Finance, whose Root-Loans funded every tunnel in Melborow, whose debt calculations turned living creatures into numbers and numbers into obligations and obligations into silence. He was smaller than I'd imagined. Neat. Compact. The kind of wombat who files his claws. The kind whose violence is administrative.

"Hoebat," Sektorbat began. His voice was the voice of a creature who had long ago replaced his spine with policy. "We need to discuss yesterday's Scheduled Maintenance Event."

"The what?"

"The Scheduled Maintenance Event in Subsection 7-G. The controlled decompression of surplus substrate."

I stared at him. "You mean the tunnel collapse."

"There was no tunnel collapse." This from Vitabat. Quiet. Measured. The voice of a balance sheet explaining to a line item why it's being deleted. "The sensors registered a 2.1 event. Negligible. The substrate adjustment in 7-G was scheduled and supervised."

"Supervised by who? There was nobody—"

"The question, Hoebat," Vitabat continued, "is what you were doing in an unauthorised excavation. A dig without permits, without structural clearance, without Safety Grout protocols. A dig that, our engineers tell us, is the probable cause of the instability you claim to have experienced."

The room tilted. I could feel the floor beneath my chair — the Grouted, sealed, dead floor — and for the first time, the silence of it wasn't comforting. It was the silence of a surface that has been told what to say.

"I saved Barna," I said. "He was trapped. The ceiling was coming down. I dug him out."

"You destabilised a structurally sound substrate through Reckless Digging," Sektorbat recited. He was reading from a form. A pre-written form. "Endangering fellow students and compromising the Academy's foundation. This constitutes a Category 3 violation of the Structural Compliance Code."

"The ceiling was going to—"

"The ceiling," Vitabat said, "is fine. The ceiling has always been fine. Your unauthorised excavation, however, has created liabilities. Liabilities require responses."

They expelled me. Effective immediately. My records would note "Reckless Excavation — Safety Risk" in the permanent column. I was barred from re-enrollment in any Sector Academy.

Barna was transferred to Sector 12. A reassignment he hadn't requested, to a district he'd never visited, effective that afternoon. When I tried to find him — running through corridors, asking teachers, checking the registry — his file had already been moved. His desk was empty. His tunnel-maps, the ones he'd drawn on the back of worksheets, had been cleared away.

They told him never to speak to me again. I learned this years later, from a Lo Snout who'd worked the Sector 12 mail route. Barna had tried to send a message. The message was intercepted. The content was classified.

I never found out what it said.

---

## Chapter 5: The Fracture

I went home. Which, for a wombat from the Eucalyptus Groves, meant descending three levels, squeezing through the root-channels the Council hadn't mapped, and walking the seep-line path that connected our burrow to the last living water in the district. The stringybarks were creaking in the evening air. The smell of eucalyptus hit me like memory — like Mum's stories, like the vibration beneath my childhood bed, like everything the Academy had tried to grout over.

Cornelibat was in the kitchen. She knew already. The Sector 7 administration had sent a notification — a formal document, stamped, filed, efficient. Her son had been expelled for Reckless Digging. Her son had endangered the Academy. Her son was a liability.

I could see it in her posture before she spoke. The rigidity. The desperate straightness of her spine — a wombat who had been exiled once for feeling too much, wrapping herself in structure so it could never happen again.

"Hoebat," she said. "Sit down."

"I saved Barna."

"I know."

"They said I *caused* the collapse. They said it was a Scheduled Maintenance Event. They said—"

"I know what they said." Her voice was careful. Measured. The voice of a creature packing explosives into a very small space. "And I know what you did. And I am telling you: keep your head down. The nail that sticks up gets hammered."

"Keep my head *down*? Mum, they lied. They erased what happened. They took Barna—"

"I know."

"Then do something! You were a Root-Counter. You know how the system works. File a complaint. Audit the structural records. Prove the tunnel was compromised before we—"

"Hoebat." She turned from the counter. Her eyes were wet. Not crying — Cornelibat didn't cry. But her eyes held the specific moisture of a creature who had already fought this fight, already lost, already learned the cost. "I can't."

"You *won't*."

"Same thing."

"No it isn't! You told me about the Dust-Bearers. You told me they tended the earth. You told me—"

"Stories, Hoebat. I told you stories. Stories aren't shovels. Stories don't keep roofs from falling."

"The Old Ways kept Barna alive."

"The Old Ways got you expelled!"

We stood in the kitchen — the small, damp kitchen in the marginal burrow, with the stringybark roots threading through the ceiling and the seep-water trickling behind the walls — and the distance between us was geological. Not meters. Eras. She was standing in the era of her exile, the burned-once-never-again territory of a wombat who had chosen safety over truth. I was standing in the era before the burning, the era her stories had built in my head, the era of the Dust-Bearers and the living earth and the paws that listened.

"Your stories were lies," I said. I was fourteen. I had all the cruelty of a child who has just discovered that his parents are afraid. "If you won't stand up for them in the real world, they were lies. Just bedtime garbage to make a kid feel special."

She flinched. The way substrate flinches before it fractures — a micro-compression, a holding of breath, the material deciding which way to break.

"I won't be a Grout-Layer," I said. "I won't be silent. I won't keep my head down while they bury the truth in Scheduled Maintenance Events."

I packed a bag. Trowel. Clay samples. A waterskin. The things a wombat takes when he's leaving and doesn't know where he's going. I left through the root-channel, not the front door, because the front door faced the Groves and the Groves faced the Sector line and the Sector line faced the Council and I was done facing any of it.

I didn't go up. I didn't go out. I went *down*.

Into the Gray Grotto. Into the shadow of Melborow. Into the unmapped levels where the Council's jurisdiction dissolved like Grout in acid, where the substrate was raw and the water ran dark and the creatures who lived there had been forgotten by every system except gravity.

Behind me, in the kitchen, Cornelibat stood perfectly still. I didn't look back. If I had, I might have seen her paws shaking. I might have seen her pick up the notification form and tear it in half. I might have seen her press her forehead against the kitchen wall — the wall with the living roots, the wall that still hummed — and whisper something I wouldn't understand for twenty years.

But I didn't look back. I was fourteen. I knew everything.

---

## Chapter 6: The Sump-Dweller

The basement levels of the Gray Grotto are where Melborow stores the things it doesn't want to think about.

Leaking sumps. Corroded pipes. Infrastructure so old it predates the Council, dug by creatures whose names were never entered into any ledger. And wombats. The kind the upper levels pretend don't exist: Lo Snouts who couldn't afford the Root-Loans, Dust-Bearers who refused the Grout, runaways and exiles and broken things that rolled downhill because that's what gravity does to the discarded.

I lived there for three years.

Not lived — survived. I became a Ghost-Digger. An unauthorised repairer. The Council's infrastructure was failing from the bottom up — sumps leaking, walls cracking, relief drains clogged with the silt nobody budgeted to clear — and the Lo Snouts on levels nine and ten were drowning. Not metaphorically. Actually drowning. The collection sumps would overflow in heavy rain, and the water — Melborow's greasy, chemical sweat — would pour through the seepage walls into their unlined tunnels. The Council called it "perimeter redistribution." The Lo Snouts called it Thursday.

I fixed things. I packed clay into fractures that nobody had reported because reporting meant forms and forms meant contact with the Council and contact with the Council meant debt. I shored up collapsing ceilings with scavenged timber. I cleared drains with my bare paws, pulling clots of compacted silt from pipes that hadn't been serviced since before I was born. The work was ugly, anonymous, and necessary. Nobody paid me. Nobody thanked me. Nobody knew my name.

I was bitter. I was alone. I was hunted — the Council's Safety Inspectors patrolled the mid-levels, and an unlicensed digger was a fine waiting to happen. I moved at night. Slept in abandoned service vaults. Ate whatever the Lo Snouts could spare, which was never enough and always stale.

I was also, without knowing it, learning. Every fracture I packed, every drain I cleared, every ceiling I held up with my hands and my stubbornness was a lesson. Not the Academy's lessons — load tables and cure ratios and the dead mathematics of Grout. Real lessons. The kind that enter through the paws and settle in the bones. I was learning the language of damaged earth. Learning to read stress the way a doctor reads a pulse. Learning that substrate isn't material — it's conversation. The earth talks. The Grout is the muzzle. Remove the muzzle and the earth will tell you everything: where it hurts, where it's tired, where it's given up, where it's still trying.

Three years of this. Three years of darkness and anonymity and the slow accumulation of knowledge that has no curriculum and no credential. Three years of becoming the thing Mum's stories described — a creature who tends the earth instead of conquering it — while simultaneously being too proud and too angry to admit that her stories were the reason I could do any of it.

Then I found the beggar.

---

## Chapter 7: The Beggar Fool

The drainage vault on Sub-Level 4 had been sealed decades ago — condemned, the access hatch welded shut with a bead of Safety Grout that was supposed to last forever. The Grout had cracked. Of course it had. Grout always cracks eventually. That's the secret the Council can never admit: the substance they pour to prevent fractures is itself subject to fracture. The fix needs fixing. The seal needs sealing. It's turtles all the way down, except the turtles are made of synthetic sealant and the bottom turtle is a lie.

I found the crack while tracing a water leak from Sub-Level 3. Followed the seep through a service corridor, past a junction the maintenance maps didn't show, into a chamber that smelled of standing water and something else — something animal and sharp. Territorial. Urine and sweat and the particular musk of a wombat who hasn't groomed in months.

He was sitting against the far wall, wrapped in a filthy ceremonial sash — the kind the Wombarams wore during State Consecrations, gold thread tarnished to brown, the insignia of the Baram Order barely visible beneath layers of grime. He was talking to a jar.

A sealed jar. Glass. Empty, as far as I could tell. He held it to his ear, tilted his head, and nodded.

"Yes," he muttered. "Yes, I agree completely. The acoustics are deplorable."

I stood in the doorway, dripping, holding my trowel, trying to decide whether this was a mad creature or a dangerous one.

"Close the door, nephew," he said without looking up. "The silence escapes if you leave it open."

---

Uncle Hangbat. The family's Black Sheep. Mum had mentioned him exactly twice — once to explain why we didn't attend the Family Gather anymore ("Your uncle made things... complicated"), and once, late at night, when she thought I was asleep, whispering to herself: "Hang-Mu knew. He always knew. And they punished him for it."

He was older than I expected. Gaunt. His fur had gone the particular grey-brown of a creature who has lived underground for so long that the sun is a theory. But his eyes — when he finally looked up from the jar and focused them on me — his eyes were sharp. Alert. The eyes of a creature who has spent years pretending to be broken so that the unbroken part of him can keep working.

"Cornelibat's boy," he said. Not a question. "You have her paws. Wide. Sensitive. Built for listening." He tilted his head. "Also, you smell like sump drainage and self-righteousness. So you've been doing the Ghost-Digger thing. How's that working out?"

"How do you know—"

"I know every leak in these walls, boy. I've been listening to them for eight years. The sumps talk. The pipes gossip. And the earth..." He pressed his palm flat against the floor. "The earth remembers every creature who touches it. You've been touching a lot of earth lately."

He stood. Slowly. The ceremonial sash shifted, and I saw what was underneath: not the rags of a beggar, but the body of a creature who had once been powerful. Broad shoulders. Thick forepaws. The musculature of a wombat built for load-bearing work — the kind of body the Academy would have classified as "Superior Structural Asset."

"You know who I am," he said. It was still not a question.

"Uncle Hangbat. Mum's brother. The family embarrassment."

"The family's *Black Sheep*." He smiled. It was the smile of a creature who has been called every name in the lexicon and decided to wear the worst one as a badge. "But that's the costume, nephew. The mask. Do you want to know the name underneath?"

He drew himself up. The sash fell open. Underneath, stitched into the lining in thread that still held a faint golden glow — gold dust, I realised, woven into fabric — was a title:

**Howlbaram. High Priest of Rites. Keeper of the Spiral-Step.**

"I am — or was — the highest-ranking Baram of the Consecration Order," he said. "The creature responsible for presiding over the most sacred ritual in wombat civilisation. The ceremony in which we told ourselves we were saving the world."

He looked at the jar in his hand. The empty jar. The jar of silence.

"We weren't saving anything," he said. "We were feeding it."

---

## Chapter 8: The Beautiful Snare

The story Hangbat told me in that drainage vault took three nights. Not because it was long but because it kept breaking him. He'd reach a certain point — a name, a memory, a detail that the years hadn't managed to sand smooth — and his voice would stop. Not catch or waver. *Stop*. Like a machine that has hit a load it can't bear. He'd sit in the silence for minutes at a time, holding the jar, and then he'd start again from a different angle, approaching the unbearable truth the way you approach a fracture in a ceiling — carefully, obliquely, never head-on.

The Wombiki.

Everyone in Melborow knew the name. The Wombiki were the legendary dancers — the ancient order who performed the Spiral-Step, that rhythmic packing of soil that maintained the organic integrity of the burrows. In the official histories, they were heroes. Martyrs. Creatures who had given their lives to hold back the Static, who had danced themselves into the foundations of the city, whose sacrifice was the reason the tunnels still stood.

The official histories, as Hangbat explained with a bitterness that tasted of metal, were garbage.

"They weren't martyrs, Hoebat. They were prisoners. Fat, pampered, terrified prisoners who danced because the alternative was thinking, and thinking would have killed them faster than the Grout."

The Beautiful Snare. That's what Hangbat called the system the Wombarams — the priestly order he'd belonged to — had built around the Wombiki. The State kept the dancers in the upper tiers, the good burrows, the clean tunnels. They were fed the best food. Given the softest bedding. Groomed by attendants. Wrapped in the Grout-Honey — the state-sanctioned luxuries that made imprisonment feel like privilege.

In return, the Wombiki danced. They performed the Spiral-Step at official ceremonies, their bodies packed with gold dust, their movements precise and ancient and beautiful. And when the time came — when the Consecration was called, when the Council decided that a particular sector needed "spiritual reinforcement" — a Wombiki was selected. Led to the designated tunnel. Danced into the wet Grout before it cured.

Sealed alive.

"Soul-Anchors," Hangbat whispered. "That's what we called them. The official doctrine said that a Wombiki's spirit, embedded in the Grout at the moment of curing, would anchor the organic frequency to the structure. Would keep the tunnel alive. Would hold back the Static through the power of sacrifice."

He paused. Held the jar. Listened to whatever silence lived inside it.

"It was a lie. The whole thing was a lie. The Consecration had no effect on the Static. None. Zero. The engineering team ran the numbers — the tunnels consecrated with Wombiki performed identically to the ones without. There was no spiritual reinforcement. No organic anchor. The Wombiki died in the Grout and the Static kept coming and the Council kept ordering Consecrations because the *ritual itself* was the point. The sacrifice was the product. It kept the population believing that someone was doing something about the crisis, that the crisis was being managed, that the authorities had it under control. The Wombiki were a show."

"And they knew?"

"They *all* knew. Not the details — the Council kept the engineering data classified. But the Wombiki knew the Grout was coming for them. They could feel it. They could feel the frost in the honey, the numbness creeping into the luxury, the way the Snare tightened every time a new Consecration was announced. They knew, and they kept dancing. Because the alternative was rebellion, and rebellion meant losing the honey, and losing the honey meant feeling the full weight of what was happening to the world, and that weight — the truth of the collapse, the reality of the Static, the knowledge that the ground beneath them was dying — was heavier than any of them could carry alone."

"All except one."

His voice changed on that word. *One*. It went from bitter to broken. From the controlled fury of a creature recounting history to the uncontrolled grief of a creature recounting a person.

"Vara," he said.

---

Vara had been his student. The most gifted Wombiki of her generation — not because her Spiral-Step was the most precise, but because she danced with her eyes open. She saw. She felt the frost in the honey. She understood, long before anyone told her, that the crystallisation wasn't a natural disaster. It was a cage.

"She tried to stop the Step," Hangbat said. "She stood up in the Rehearsal Chamber and told the other Wombiki the truth: that the Consecration was theatre, that the Grout had no spiritual properties, that they were being killed for decoration. She begged them to stop dancing."

"What happened?"

"Nothing. That's what happened. They listened. They understood. They believed her. And then they went back to the honey. Because believing the truth and acting on the truth are different muscles, Hoebat, and these creatures had spent their whole lives exercising the wrong one."

Vara was scheduled for the Consecration of Sector 7. Hangbat — Howlbaram, High Priest — was supposed to preside. He was supposed to speak the words, bless the Grout, watch the dancer descend.

Instead, he danced.

"The Broken Spiral," he said, and his voice was almost a laugh, except the laugh had something sharp inside it. "I walked into the ceremony in my Baram robes and I danced a Broken Spiral into the wet Grout before it could cure. Shattered the pour. Ruined the batch. The entire Consecration had to be scrapped."

"And Vara?"

The silence lasted a long time.

"Trum-Bat killed her." Flat. No inflection. The voice of a creature stating a fact the way you state a measurement. "Not during the ceremony — I stopped that. After. Quietly. The way Trum-Bat does everything — through infrastructure. She was found in a sealed tunnel in Sector 7. The official report called it 'structural failure.' The tunnel had been grouted the night before. Fresh pour. Perfect Grout. Not a crack in it."

He looked at me. His eyes were dry. Past tears. Past the point where grief has anything wet left to offer.

"They didn't just kill her, Hoebat. They *used* her. They took her last frequency — the resonance of her fear, her defiance, the vibration of a creature dying in Grout with the truth in her throat — and they wove it into the Melborow Frequency. That hum you hear in every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment. That's not just the Council's broadcast. It's the sound of everyone they've buried. Vara's last breath is in there. Singing you to sleep."

I sat in the drainage vault and felt the Frequency pressing against my fur. The constant hum I'd lived with my whole life. The background noise of Melborow. The sound of safety.

The sound of a murdered dancer, screaming forever in the infrastructure.

---

## Chapter 9: The Gold Seam

Hangbat refused to teach me the Council's Grout-Geometry. "You can learn that at any Academy," he said. "They hand it out like pamphlets. Grout-Geometry is the language of covering things up. I'm going to teach you the language of breaking things open."

The True Kintsugi-Mu.

He said it the way you say the name of something sacred — not louder, but slower, with more space between the syllables, as if each sound needed room to land.

"Kintsugi," he said. "You know the word?"

"Japanese. The art of repairing broken pottery with gold."

"The art of making the *break the strongest part*." He held up a fragment of clay he'd salvaged from a collapsed wall — a sharp-edged shard, jagged, ugly. "The Grout tries to hide the break. Seal it over. Pretend it never happened. The Council's entire philosophy is based on concealment — fill the crack, smooth the surface, make it look like the fracture was never there. But the crack was there. The fracture was real. And every creature who walks over a hidden fracture carries the weight of its denial without knowing it."

He turned the shard in his paws. "The Kintsugi-Mu says: don't hide the break. *Fill it with gold*. Make the fracture visible. Make it beautiful. Make it stronger than the original material, so the vessel doesn't break in the same place twice."

"The break is where the light enters," he whispered. "The Grout tries to keep the light out. The Kintsugi-Mu invites it in."

He taught me over months. Not quickly — Hangbat didn't do anything quickly. He taught the way the earth teaches: through repetition, through failure, through the slow accumulation of understanding that settles into the paws before it reaches the brain.

First, the gold dust. He kept it in a pouch made from Wattle-bark — actual bark, not synthetic, carrying the faint resonance of a tree that had been dead for longer than either of us had been alive. The dust inside was fine as talcum, warm to the touch, and when you held it in your palm, you could feel it vibrating. Not physically. *Emotionally*. The gold dust was a conductor for Arnam — that substance the old stories called "empathy" but which is really something more precise: the organic frequency that living things generate when they're in relationship with each other. The frequency that says *I am here, you are here, and the space between us is not empty.*

"You cannot mend stone," Hangbat said, watching me try to pack gold-laced clay into a fracture in the vault wall, "until you mend the spirit of the creature who dug it."

"The stone doesn't have a spirit."

"Everything dug by a wombat has a spirit. The spirit of the digger enters the substrate through the paws. That's the whole point of paws, Hoebat — they're not just tools. They're transmitters. Every tunnel in Melborow carries the emotional residue of the creature who carved it. The angry tunnels are brittle. The fearful tunnels leak. The joyful tunnels — and there are so few of those — the joyful tunnels hold."

I pressed the gold-clay into the fracture. Felt it bond with the substrate on either side. Felt the warmth of the gold conducting something through the break — not heat, not energy, but *connection*. The two sides of the fracture, which had been pulling apart, relaxed. Settled. Found a new equilibrium that was different from the original but not weaker.

Stronger. The gold seam was stronger than the unbroken wall.

"Again," Hangbat said. "Slower."

I did it again. And again. For months I did it, in the drainage vault, in abandoned tunnels, in the crumbling infrastructure of the lower levels where nobody came and nobody watched. Packing gold-clay into fractures. Learning to feel the spirit of the stone. Learning that a crack isn't a failure — it's an opening. A door. The place where the light enters, if you let it.

"The city is a fractured soul, Hoebat," Hangbat said one night, when the gold dust was low and the silence in his jar was thick. "Every tunnel, every wall, every foundation — they're all carrying the weight of what was done to the Wombiki. The Grout holds the fear in. The Kintsugi lets it out."

He pressed a pouch of gold dust into my paw. The last of his supply. He'd been saving it for something. For someone.

"You must go to the Shattered Gorge," he said. "Not to hide. To learn. The Gorge is where the earth still bleeds — where the fracture is so deep and so honest that even the Council can't Grout it over. Find the places where the earth still hurts. That's where the mending starts."

I packed my bag. Trowel. Gold dust. Clay. The tools of the True Kintsugi-Mu. The things that matter when the Frequency dies and the lights go out.

"Uncle," I said at the door.

"Hangbat," he corrected. "The name Howlbaram died with Vara. What's left is just a beggar with a jar."

"Thank you."

He waved a paw. Dismissive. Already turning back to his jar, to his silence, to whatever conversation the absence of sound was having with the absence of hope.

"Don't thank me," he said. "Go mend something."

## Chapter 10: The Screaming Bird

The Shattered Gorge cuts across the southern shell of Hún Nico like a wound that refused to heal.

Which, in a sense, is exactly what it is. The Gorge is the world's largest fracture — a rift in the substrate where the organic meets the crystalline and neither can claim victory. The northern face is rough, root-threaded, alive. You can press your paw against it and feel the slow pulse of substrate that still remembers how to hold. The southern face is smooth, geometric, the hexagonal facets of the lattice claiming the stone cell by cell. And between them — the Gorge itself — there is nothing. Air and depth and the sound of the earth breathing through its biggest wound.

I spent weeks there. Walking the rim. Descending into the crevices where the crystal formations were transitional — half-formed, blurry at the edges, the Static in the process of claiming territory but not yet finished. I studied the anatomy of the break. I packed gold-clay into fractures that would never be seen by any creature with a ledger. I talked to the stone — which sounds mad, and is, and also works.

The earth in the Gorge was different from the earth in Melborow. It was honest. In the city, the substrate has been so thoroughly grouted, so completely sealed, so aggressively silenced that feeling anything through it requires decades of training. In the Gorge, the substrate screams. Every layer, every stratum, every compressed epoch of geological history is right there, exposed, readable, shouting its composition to any creature with paws sensitive enough to listen.

I was listening when the bird fell.

Not fell — crashed. There's a difference. Falling is what gravity does to objects. Crashing is what gravity does to creatures who are still trying to fly when their wings have given out.

He came down like a pink comet. A streak of colour against the grey-brown stone, trailing feathers and noise and a desperation that I could feel in my forepaws before I could see its source. He hit the northern face of the Gorge about thirty meters above me, bounced off a ledge, tumbled through a crevice, and came to rest on a scree slope in a cloud of dust and outrage.

A Galah. Young. Juvenile, by the look of his feathers — oversized chambers, undersized wings, the proportions of a creature who hadn't grown into himself yet. One wing was shattered. The angle was wrong — the humerus displaced, the primary feathers splayed at angles that made my structural instincts wince. He was bleeding from half a dozen scrapes. His crest was up — fully up, the pink feathers standing vertical, which in Galah body language means either "I am experiencing intense emotion" or "I am about to make a terrible decision."

In his good claw, he was clutching something. A seed. Small. Dark. Pulsing with a faint violet light that had no business existing in a place as broken as the Gorge.

Behind him — above, in the sky — I could hear the drone. The mechanical buzz of a Council surveillance unit, the kind they used to monitor the border zones, tracking, tracking, always tracking. It was hunting him.

I didn't think. I didn't calculate. I didn't consult the Kintsugi-Mu training or the Old Ways or the ghost of Hangbat's teachings.

I looked at the broken bird and I saw a fracture. A living fracture. A creature whose body had cracked under the weight of whatever mission had brought him to this Gorge, and the crack was bleeding, and the bleeding would kill him if somebody didn't pack it.

I covered him with my body. The way a ceiling covers a room. The way a wombat covers the thing he's holding.

The drone buzzed overhead. It couldn't see us — the Gorge's northern face was too rough, too fractured, too organic for its sensors. The crystal-calibrated optics couldn't read the messy, root-threaded stone. It passed. Circled. Passed again.

The Galah was shaking. Not from cold — from something deeper. Fear-resonance. His whole body was vibrating at a frequency I'd never felt before — high, jagged, the resonance of a creature who had been flying on terror for hours and had finally run out of sky.

I reached into my vest. Found the pouch. The last of Hangbat's gold dust, mixed with my own clay — the high-grade stuff I'd been saving, the kind that bonds with living tissue as easily as it bonds with stone.

I pressed a pinch of gold-clay against the bird's chest. Not his wing — the wing was a physical problem, and physical problems could wait. The fear-resonance was the structural emergency. The bird's spirit was fracturing, and if the spirit broke, no amount of splinting would save the wing.

The gold-clay absorbed the frequency. Dampened it. Conducted the panic into the earth beneath us, where the Gorge's living substrate could hold it the way it held everything — with patience, with depth, with the geological stubbornness of stone that has been broken and is still here.

The Galah stopped shaking. His crest lowered. Half an inch. Enough.

He looked at me. His eyes were enormous — the eyes of a creature who has seen something too large for his skull and is still carrying it. He didn't say thank you. He didn't explain why he was in the Gorge, or what had shattered his wing, or why a Council drone was hunting a juvenile bird across the border zones.

He shoved the seed into my paw. The violet seed. It was warm. It pulsed against my palm the way Hangbat's gold dust pulsed — not physically but emotionally, carrying a frequency that my paws could read and my brain couldn't yet name.

"Plant it where the Grout cracks, kid," the Galah said. His voice was raw. Cracked. The voice of a creature who had been screaming for a very long time and had only recently stopped. "The Violet needs a fracture."

He looked at the seed in my paw. Looked at the Gorge — the great wound in the earth, the fracture that refused to heal, the break that was too honest for even the Council to cover up.

"That's a Jacaranda," he said. "That's the new tree. Not a Wattle — those are done. Something else. Something with shallow roots. Something that reaches out instead of drilling down."

He coughed. Blood at the corner of his beak. His wing was worse than I'd thought.

"My name's Cooroo," he said. "I'm a Galah. And I've been screaming for longer than you've been digging. So here's the deal: you plant that seed, you hold it, you do whatever it is that wombats do when they're tending something that isn't dead yet. And when it grows — and it will grow, because the Violet doesn't know how to quit — it's going to need more than just a wombat with a trowel. It's going to need all of us."

He passed out. Which was probably the most sensible thing he'd done all day.

I sat in the Gorge with a broken Galah and a violet seed and the last of Hangbat's gold dust, and I felt the earth beneath my paws humming with something I couldn't name.

Not yet.

I pressed the seed into the clay. Into the fracture. Into the Compassion Gap where the organic met the crystalline and neither had won.

The Violet needs a fracture. And the Gorge was full of them.

I packed the earth around the seed with my bare paws. Gently. Carefully. The way Mum used to smooth the fur behind my ear. The way the Dust-Bearers tended the earth in her stories.

Not fixing. Tending.

The seed pulsed. Once. Twice. A heartbeat in the stone.

I stayed.
