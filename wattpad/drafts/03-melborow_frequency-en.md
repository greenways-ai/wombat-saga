# The Melborow Frequency

## Chapter 1: Dead Zones

The rain in Melborow wasn't water. It was the city's sweat, greasy and gray, carrying the taste of rust and forgotten drainage down from the heights of Queensborow to pool in the alleys of the Gray Grotto. It found every crack in the pavement, every seam in the concrete, every wound the High-Noses had left unattended.

Hoebat didn't mind the rain. Rain meant the Grout was swelling, and swelling Grout meant work. But this rain—this persistent, oily drizzle—felt different. It felt like drowning from above.

"Signal's weak," Lolaboo muttered, her claw tapping the screen of her BorowFinder app. The glow of the device painted her fur in sickly blue light. "Says we're close. Seventy meters."

Seventy meters. In the daylight, with the Frequency humming and the streetlights working, seventy meters was nothing. A stroll. A commute. But the streetlights in this district had stopped working six months ago, and the Council hadn't sent a crew to fix them. Section 2.4 of the Urban Maintenance Code: Temporal Cropping. Let the periphery decay. Let the edges fail. Focus resources on the center. On the Cathedral. On the projects that looked good in reports.

Hoebat knew the code. He'd helped write parts of it, back when he still believed in the system.

"They call it 'up-and-coming,'" Lolaboo said, her voice tight. She was trying to sound professional. Trying to believe the marketing. "The listing said 'emerging district with character.'"

"The character is rot," Hoebat said.

He looked down the alley. His eyes had adjusted hours ago, compensating for the missing photons, reading the texture of the dark. He saw what Lolaboo's app couldn't show her: the sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down, the hairline fracture in the Grout where water was pooling, the faint luminescence of early-stage Static colonization in the foundation cracks.

He saw a Dead Zone.

The Council didn't call them that in the official documentation. They used terms like "transitioning neighborhoods" or "development-pending areas." But Hoebat knew the signs. The smashed streetlights weren't vandalism. They were policy. A slow withdrawal of services designed to make residents leave voluntarily, so the Council wouldn't have to pay for relocation when the inevitable happened.

When the ceiling fell.

The hum died.

Not the rain. The rain kept falling, indifferent. But the Melborow Frequency—the constant, low-grade thrum that filled every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment in the city—cut out. The digital infrastructure, the networked lights, the comforting buzz of connectivity: all of it, gone.

Lolaboo's app flickered and died. The blue light vanished. They stood in absolute dark, two shapes pressed against each other under a rusted awning, listening to the rain and the silence.

"Hoebat?" Her voice was small. Professionalism stripped away. Just fear now.

"Don't move," he said.

He didn't say *don't make a sound*. Sound didn't matter anymore. Whatever was out there in the dark wasn't hunting by noise. It was hunting by smell. By heat. By the chemical signature of Soft-Paws who'd wandered too far from Queensborow.

From the storm drain—one of the collapsed ones, the ones that weren't on any official map anymore—came the shape of something that wasn't a wombat.

Three somethings.

They moved like hunger given form. Lean, rib-thin, their gaits irregular, broken. Lost Dingoes. Scavengers. The ones who'd fallen out of the Pack structure, who'd lost the Static-Logic that let Dingoes calculate vectors and trajectories. These were the desperate ones. The ones who'd forgotten the Old Code and only knew the New Hunger.

They circled. Eyes catching the distant orange flicker of a trash-fire, reflecting it back in twin points of golden light. No whites. Just gold on black. Predator optics.

Lolaboo pressed against Hoebat's flank. He felt her trembling. Felt the heat of her panic. Felt the exact moment when she realized that her BorowFinder app, her eucalyptus soap, her Queensborow grooming habits—all of it was useless here.

"Hoebat," she whispered. "They're going to—"

"Stay still."

His voice was gravel. Low. Almost subsonic. The voice he used when packing substrate, when feeling for stress fractures, when listening to the earth decide whether it wanted to hold or fall.

He didn't reach for a weapon. He had none. Wombats didn't fight. Wombats endured. Wombats held the weight until the weight became architecture.

Instead, he remembered.

The plains. The dry season. Sitting by a fire with Pokero, sharing strips of jerky, playing the Haiku game. *Who can say the most with the least?* Pokero had taught him things in those nights. Not friendship—Dingoes didn't offer friendship. But exchange. Mutual survival packaged in protocol.

The Secret Code.

The lead Scavenger lunged. Scarred face, notched ear, teeth that had never known the discipline of the Pack. He didn't see Hoebat. He saw prey. Soft flesh. Easy calories. The Queensborow smell of soap and safety.

Hoebat dropped his center of gravity. Felt his claws find purchase on the wet concrete. Squared his shoulders. Symmetry. Section 8.2 of the Structural Engineering manual. The posture that said: *I am load-bearing. I am not moving. You cannot push me, you cannot pull me, you cannot make me yield.*

And from the back of his throat, he made a sound.

*Click-clack, hiss, pause.*

Not a wombat sound. Not a growl, not a grunt. Rhythmic. Patterned. The Watcher's Frequency.

Then the words. Dingo-Tongue. Harsh vowels scraping against his throat like he was swallowing gravel.

*"The bone is dry. The marrow is gone. I am the Living Root, not the Dead Branch."*

The Scavenger froze.

Three meters away. Close enough that Hoebat could smell his breath. Rot and desperation. But the ears—those triangular Dingo ears, hyper-mobile, hyper-attuned—they swiveled. Caught the frequency. Processed the pattern.

Recognition.

Fear.

Not of Hoebat. Of what Hoebat represented. The Old Code. The Watcher's Frequency. The voice that said: *I am not your prey. I am the Architect of the Field. I am the one who decides which tunnels stand and which fall.*

From deeper in the dark, a fourth shape moved.

Larger. Composed. Not hungry—*present*. A Dingo who hadn't lost the Logic. Who still walked the edge between Static and organic, who could still calculate the vectors of survival.

Pokero stepped into the firelight.

He looked different in the city. Harder. Sharper. The country dust washed off, replaced by the grime of Melborow's underbelly. But the eyes—the golden eyes, patient as a held breath—those were the same.

Pokero didn't bark. Didn't growl. He let out one sharp, authoritative yelp. A command. A dismissal.

The three Scavengers scattered. Melting into the dark like they were never there. Like smoke. Like fear finding better opportunities.

Silence. Just the rain. Just the distant gutter-overflow.

"You always did have a big mouth, Hoebat," Pokero said. His voice was smoke and gravel. The voice of someone who'd been screaming into the Static for years and had learned to make the scream sound like conversation. "What brings a Root-Digger to the graveyard?"

"Looking for a home," Hoebat said. He didn't relax his stance. Not yet. Symmetry wasn't just for threats. It was for respect. "Thought the Council was selling honest burrows."

"The Council sells lies with good lighting." Pokero glanced at Lolaboo, still pressed against Hoebat's flank, eyes wide and uncomprehending. "Your mate doesn't know the Code."

"She's not my mate. She's a client."

"Same difference. Both need protection. Both smell like Queensborow." Pokero turned, looking toward the distant silhouette of Trum-Bat's Wall— that endless concrete ribbon that bisected the horizon, supposedly holding back the chaos. "The Wall won't stop what's coming, you know. Walls just make the rot smell worse. Trap it inside with the living."

"I'm not buying in the Grotto," Hoebat said.

"Good. This place is Dead Tissue. Section 3.1, if you're keeping score. The spirit's already left the body. My kind hunt here because there's nothing left to damage."

Pokero stepped closer. Close enough that Hoebat could smell him—wild, ungroomed, the scent of territories that didn't appear on any map.

"If you want a hole that won't cave in," Pokero said, his voice dropping to a whisper, "look where the Dingoes *don't* hunt. We only go where the spirit has already left. Find the places we avoid. That's where the soil still remembers how to hold."

Then he was gone. Back into the rain, into the dark, into the frequency that only his kind could hear.

The lights flickered back on.

Not fully—just the sickly yellow pulse of streetlights running on minimal current. Enough to see by. Enough to pretend the city was still working.

Lolaboo's app rebooted with a cheerful chime. Seventy meters to the property. Open concept. Emerging neighborhood. Great investment opportunity.

She looked at Hoebat. He looked at her.

"How did you do that?" she breathed.

Hoebat adjusted his pack. Felt the weight of his tools. The trowel. The gold dust. The clay samples. The things that actually mattered when the Frequency died and the lights went out.

"The High-Noses teach us the world is a math equation," he said. "Add this Grout, subtract that load, multiply by safety factors. But the Dingoes know better. They know it's a song. And songs have rules. Patterns. If you forget the lyrics—if you stop paying attention to the rhythm—they eat you."

He looked down the alley. At the sagging roof. At the Static-laced foundations. At the Dead Zone that the Council pretended didn't exist.

"We aren't buying here, Lolaboo. This isn't 'up-and-coming.' This is Dead Tissue. The soil stopped breathing months ago. We're leaving."

"But the listing—the app said—"

"The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies." Hoebat started walking, his heavy paws splashing through the greasy puddles. "If you want to survive in Melborow, you learn to listen to what the world says when the power's off. You learn to hear the silence. That's where the truth lives."

She followed him. Of course she did. They always did, eventually.

## Chapter 2: The Weight of It

Years later, Hoebat would stand in the same rain and understand what Pokero had really been telling him.

But understanding came slow. Understanding came after the Kappa Mu, after the Oath, after the five of them—Wombat, Dingo, Wallaby, Emu, Galah—had stood in the Root Chamber and sworn themselves to something larger than survival.

The Master Haiku. Seventeen syllables. The entire mission compressed into the space of a breath.

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

Hoebat remembered the vibration of their voices. Five different frequencies finding one note. The root-walls had hummed. The Jacaranda had bloomed. For one moment, standing in that violet clearing, he'd felt something he hadn't felt in years: hope.

But hope doesn't pay for Grout. Hope doesn't convince the Council to stop building Walls. Hope doesn't fix Dead Zones.

The others found their roles. Cooroo took to the high perches, screaming the truth where the Frequency couldn't drown him out. Pokero walked the edges, the places where the Static met the organic, gathering intelligence from the shadows. Merl... Merl just ran. The Emu didn't explain himself. He simply moved, creating kinetic chaos wherever the Council's geometry threatened to calcify.

But Hoebat? Hoebat had the wombats.

And the wombats didn't want to hear it.

He tried. He stood before the Council and spoke of Width over Depth. Of reaching out instead of digging down. Of the poison rising from below, the Static claiming the deep substrate, the madness of continuing to drill into a source that had turned to crystal.

They called him a Hippie Dreamer. A threat to urban stability. They had their Five-I's, their Frequency, their comforting assurance that the cracks were "within acceptable parameters." They had the **Safety of the Tally** — the cold math of load-bearing calculations that didn't account for the soil losing its will to hold.

"The Grout will hold," Trum-Bat had said, his voice smooth as polished concrete. "The Walls will protect us. We need only dig deeper, build higher, calculate more precisely."

Hoebat had wanted to scream. *The deeper you dig, the closer you get to the poison. The higher you build, the harder you fall. The more precisely you calculate, the more completely you miss the fractal reality of living soil.*

But he didn't scream. Wombats don't scream. Wombats endure.

So he did what he knew how to do. He went into the shadows.

## Chapter 3: Working in the Dark

Every night, when the Frequency dimmed and the Council's surveillance relaxed, Hoebat packed his vest.

Gold dust. Clay. A trowel worn smooth by decades of use. A map that existed only in his memory—tunnels the Council didn't know about, or pretended not to know about, fissures in the official geography where the organic substrate still breathed.

He descended alone. Past the Queensborow levels, past the Cathedral's glow, past the places where the Frequency still hummed its artificial comfort. Into the Gray Grotto. Into the Dead Zones. Into the places Pokero had warned him about.

He found the fractures before they became collapses. Packed clay into hairline cracks. Injected gold dust into compromised load-bearing walls. He repaired the world in secret because the world wouldn't let him save it in the light.

The other Kappa Mu members visited when they could. Cooroo would land in a tunnel, pink feathers absurd against the gray Grout, and scream frequency checks that told Hoebat where the stress was building. Pokero would emerge from shadow, offer intelligence on which tunnels the Lost Ones were avoiding—*go there, the soil still holds*—then vanish before gratitude could form.

But mostly, Hoebat worked alone.

He was the most isolated of them. The one carrying the weight of a roof that refused to admit it was falling. While the others screamed or ran or calculated, he simply... held. Symmetry. The posture that said *I am load-bearing. I will not move. I will be here when the ceiling comes down.*

Sometimes, standing in the dark with clay on his paws, he thought about Lolaboo. She'd left Queensborow eventually. Found a burrow in the Canopy Remnant, somewhere the Council's neglect hadn't reached yet. He heard she was happy. Heard she'd stopped using the BorowFinder app.

Good. The app lied. The Frequency lied. The Council lied.

Only the soil told the truth. And only if you knew how to listen.

## Chapter 4: The Cipher Clicks

The realization came in the rain, as these things always did.

Hoebat was standing in the Gray Grotto, years after that first night with Lolaboo. The streetlights were still smashed. The Dead Zone had spread—more tunnels abandoned, more neglect, more temporal cropping as the Council pulled resources back to the center.

He was thinking about Pokero's words. *Look where the Dingoes don't hunt.*

And he was thinking about the Oath. The Master Haiku they'd spoken in the Root Chamber.

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

The Haiku game. Semantic compression. Saying the most with the least.

Hoebat's mind moved slowly, methodically, like clay being packed into a crack. Crossing out words. Subtracting Pokero's phrase from the Oath.

*Look, where, the, dingoes, do, not, hunt.*

Remove those syllables from the poem. What remained?

> **"Light are blind, shadows hold truth."**

Not just directions. A diagnosis.

*The Council (The Light) is blind to the reality of the collapse. The truth of the world is hiding in the shadows, and we must go there to protect it.*

The Click.

Hoebat felt it in his chest—a vibration, a resonance, the mechanical shifting of understanding into place. He was playing the game. Pokero had made a move, years ago in that alley, and only now did Hoebat see the counter-move hidden in the negative space.

Far away, in the Violet Zone, Cooroo felt it too. The root-network carried the vibration—a frequency shift, a signal that the Mind of the Squad had awakened. The Galah screamed a check into the dawn. The echo returned changed.

Hoebat knew where to go now. He understood the mission.

Not to save the Center. The Center was calcified, lost, addicted to its own Frequency.

To work in the shadows. To hold the edges. To find the places where the Dingoes didn't hunt—the places where the spirit hadn't left, where the soil still breathed, where the Grout hadn't completely won.

To be the Living Root, not the Dead Branch.

He picked up his trowel. Adjusted his vest. Walked into the dark, toward the next fracture, toward the next place that needed holding.

The work never ended. The weight never lightened.

But Hoebat was a wombat. And wombats endure.
