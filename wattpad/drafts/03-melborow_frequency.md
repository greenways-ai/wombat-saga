# The Melborow Frequency

## Chapter 1: The Load

The rain in Melborow isn't water. It's the city's sweat—gray, greasy, carrying rust and neglect down from Queensborow to pool in the alleys of the Gray Grotto. It finds every crack where the Grout has failed, every wound the High-Noses left unattended.

I don't mind rain. Rain means the Grout swells. Swelling Grout means work. But this rain feels different. Heavier. Like drowning from above.

"Signal's weak," Lolaboo mutters. Her claw taps the BorowFinder app, that blue glow painting her fur in Council-approved colors. "Seventy meters. Almost there."

Seventy meters. In daylight, with the Frequency humming and the streetlights working, that's nothing. A commute. A stroll. But the lights in this district stopped working six months ago. Section 2.4: Temporal Cropping. Let the periphery decay. Focus resources on the Cathedral. On the projects that look good in reports.

I helped write Section 2.4. Back when I believed the system.

"They call it 'up-and-coming,'" Lolaboo says, trying to sound professional. Trying to believe the marketing. "Emerging district with character."

"The character is rot," I say.

I look down the alley. My eyes adjusted hours ago, compensating for the missing photons. I see what her app can't show: the sag in the tunnel roof three burrows down, the hairline fracture in the Grout where water pools, the faint luminescence of Static colonization in the foundation cracks.

I see a Dead Zone.

The Council calls them "transitioning neighborhoods." "Development-pending areas." But I know the signs. The smashed streetlights aren't vandalism. They're policy. Slow withdrawal of services designed to make residents leave voluntarily, so the Council won't pay for relocation when the inevitable happens.

When the ceiling falls.

The hum dies.

Not the rain. The rain keeps falling, indifferent. But the Melborow Frequency—that constant thrum filling every tunnel, every burrow, every waking moment—cuts out. The digital infrastructure, the networked lights, the comforting buzz: all of it, gone.

Lolaboo's app dies. The blue light vanishes. We stand in absolute dark, two shapes under a rusted awning, listening to rain and silence.

"Hoebat?" Her voice is small now. Professionalism stripped away. Just fear.

"Don't move," I say.

I don't say don't make a sound. Sound doesn't matter anymore. Whatever's out there isn't hunting by noise. It's hunting by smell. By heat. By the chemical signature of Soft-Paws who wandered too far from Queensborow.

From the storm drain—collapsed, unmapped, forgotten—they come.

Three shapes. Not wombats. Lean, rib-thin, moving with jagged grace. Lost Dingoes. Scavengers. The ones who fell out of the Pack structure, who lost the Static-Logic, who only know hunger and desperation.

They circle. Eyes catching distant trash-fire light, reflecting gold on black. Predator optics.

Lolaboo presses against my flank. I feel her trembling. Feel the exact moment she realizes her app, her soap, her Queensborow habits—all of it is useless here.

"Hoebat," she whispers. "They're going to—"

"Stay still."

My voice is gravel. Low. The voice I use when packing substrate, when feeling for stress fractures, when listening to the earth decide whether to hold or fall.

I don't reach for a weapon. I have none. Wombats don't fight. We endure. We hold weight until weight becomes architecture.

Instead, I remember.

The plains. The dry season. Sitting by fire with Pokero, sharing jerky, playing the Haiku game. *Who can say the most with the least?* He taught me things in those nights. Not friendship—Dingoes don't offer that. But exchange. Survival packaged in protocol.

The Secret Code.

The lead Scavenger lunges. Scarred, notched ear, teeth that never knew Pack discipline. He doesn't see me. He sees prey. Soft flesh. Easy calories. Queensborow smell.

I drop my center of gravity. Find purchase on wet concrete. Square my shoulders. Symmetry. Section 8.2. The posture that says: *I am load-bearing. I am not moving. You cannot push me, pull me, make me yield.*

From my throat, I make a sound.

*Click-clack, hiss, pause.*

The Watcher's Frequency.

Then the words. Dingo-Tongue. Harsh vowels scraping like broken glass:

*"The bone is dry. The marrow is gone. I am the Living Root, not the Dead Branch."*

The Scavenger freezes.

Three meters away. Close enough to smell his breath—rot and desperation. But his ears swivel. The Code hits him like a physical thing, penetrating the Static-haze, triggering something older than hunger.

Recognition. Fear.

Not of me. Of what I represent. The Old Code. The Watcher's Frequency. The voice that says: *I am not your prey. I am Architect of the Field. I decide which tunnels stand and which fall.*

From deeper dark, a fourth shape moves.

Larger. Composed. Not hungry—*present*. A Dingo who hasn't lost the Logic.

Pokero steps into the firelight.

He looks different in the city. Harder. Sharper. The country dust washed off, replaced by Melborow grime. But the eyes—golden, patient as held breath—those are the same.

He doesn't bark. Doesn't growl. One sharp yelp. Command. Dismissal.

The Scavengers scatter. Melting into dark like smoke. Like fear finding better opportunities.

"You always did have a big mouth, Hoebat," Pokero says. His voice is smoke and gravel. Someone who's been screaming into the Static for years and learned to make it sound like conversation. "What brings a Root-Digger to my graveyard?"

"Looking for a home. Thought the Council sold honest burrows."

"The Council sells lies with good lighting." He glances at Lolaboo, still pressed against me, eyes wide. "Your female doesn't know the Code."

"She's not my female. She's a client."

"Same difference. Both smell like Queensborow. Both think the Frequency will save them." He turns toward the Wall—Trum-Bat's endless concrete ribbon, bisecting the horizon. "The Wall won't stop what's coming. Walls just make the rot smell worse."

"I'm not buying in the Grotto," I say.

"Good. This place is Dead Tissue. Section 3.1. The spirit's already left. My kind hunt here because there's nothing left to damage."

He steps closer. Close enough to smell—wild, ungroomed, the scent of territories that don't appear on maps.

"If you want a hole that won't cave in," he says, voice dropping to a whisper, "look where the Dingoes don't hunt. We only go where the spirit has left. Find the places we avoid. That's where the soil still remembers how to hold."

Then he's gone. Back into rain, into dark, into the frequency only his kind can hear.

The lights flicker back on. Sickly yellow. The Frequency returns—that electronic hum telling us everything is fine, everything is connected, please don't notice the foundations crumbling.

Lolaboo's app reboots. Cheerful chime. Seventy meters to property. Great investment opportunity.

She looks at me. I look at her.

"How did you do that?" she breathes.

I adjust my pack. Feel the weight of tools. The trowel. The gold dust. The clay. The things that matter when power dies and lights go out.

"The High-Noses teach us the world is a math equation," I say. "Add this Grout, subtract that load, multiply by safety factors. But the Dingoes know better. They know it's a song. And songs have rules. Patterns. If you forget the lyrics—if you stop paying attention to the rhythm—they eat you."

I look down the alley. At the sagging roof. At the Static-laced foundations. At the Dead Zone the Council pretends doesn't exist.

"We aren't buying here, Lolaboo. This isn't 'up-and-coming.' This is Dead Tissue. The soil stopped breathing months ago. We're leaving."

"But the listing—the app said—"

"The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies." I start walking, heavy paws splashing through greasy puddles. "If you want to survive in Melborow, you learn to listen to what the world says when the power's off. You learn to hear the silence. That's where the truth lives."

She follows. Of course she does. They always do, eventually.

## Chapter 2: The Failure

Years pass. The Static rises. The Council builds higher, digs deeper, calculates more precisely, misses more completely.

I find the others. Cooroo—the screaming bird with his Noble Noise. Merl—the Emu who runs in spirals and refuses explanation. Bash—the Wallaby who feels us in his body, who limps when I break ribs three kilometers away.

And Pokero. Always Pokero. Walking the edges, gathering intelligence from shadows.

We stand in the Root Chamber. Five species. Five impossibilities. We don't sign ledgers. We speak a poem.

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

The Master Haiku. The Oath.

I feel it resonate. Five frequencies finding one note. The root-walls hum. For one moment, I feel something I haven't felt in years: hope.

But hope doesn't pay for Grout. Hope doesn't convince the Council to stop building Walls.

The others find their roles. Cooroo takes the high perches, screaming truth where the Frequency can't drown him. Pokero walks the edges. Merl runs, creating chaos wherever the Council's geometry calcifies.

But I have the wombats.

And the wombats don't want to hear it.

I stand before the Council. Speak of Width over Depth. Of reaching out instead of digging down. Of the poison rising from below, the Static claiming the deep substrate, the madness of drilling into a source turned to crystal.

They call me Hippie Dreamer. Threat to urban stability. They have their Five-I's, their Frequency, their assurance that cracks are "within acceptable parameters." They have the Safety of the Ledger—the cold math that doesn't account for soil losing its will to hold.

"The Grout will hold," Trum-Bat says, voice smooth as polished concrete. "The Walls will protect us. We need only dig deeper, build higher, calculate more precisely."

I want to scream. *The deeper you dig, the closer you get to poison. The higher you build, the harder you fall. The more precisely you calculate, the more completely you miss the fractal reality of living soil.*

But I don't scream. Wombats don't scream. We endure.

So I go into the shadows.

## Chapter 3: Working in the Dark

Every night, when the Frequency dims and surveillance relaxes, I pack my vest.

Gold dust. Clay. A trowel worn smooth by decades. A map that exists only in memory—tunnels the Council doesn't know about, fissures in official geography where organic substrate still breathes.

I descend alone. Past Queensborow, past the Cathedral's glow, into the Gray Grotto. Into the Dead Zones. Into the places Pokero warned me about.

I find fractures before they become collapses. Pack clay into hairline cracks. Inject gold dust into compromised walls. I repair the world in secret because the world won't let me save it in the light.

The others visit when they can. Cooroo lands in tunnels, pink feathers absurd against gray Grout, screaming frequency checks that tell me where stress builds. Pokero emerges from shadow, brings intelligence on which tunnels the Lost Ones avoid—*go there, the soil still holds*—then vanishes before gratitude forms.

But mostly, I work alone.

I am the most isolated. The one carrying weight of a roof that refuses to admit it's falling. While others scream or run or calculate, I simply... hold. Symmetry. The posture that says *I am load-bearing. I will not move. I will be here when the ceiling comes down.*

Sometimes, standing in dark with clay on my paws, I think about Lolaboo. She left Queensborow eventually. Found a burrow in the Canopy Remnant, where Council neglect hasn't reached. I hear she's happy. Hear she stopped using the BorowFinder app.

Good. The app lies. The Frequency lies. The Council lies.

Only the soil tells the truth. And only if you know how to listen.

## Chapter 4: The Click

The realization comes in the rain, years after that first night with Lolaboo.

I'm standing in the Gray Grotto. The streetlights are still smashed. The Dead Zone has spread—more tunnels abandoned, more neglect, more temporal cropping as the Council pulls resources to the center.

I'm thinking about Pokero's words. *Look where the Dingoes don't hunt.*

And I'm thinking about the Oath. The Master Haiku we spoke in the Root Chamber.

> *Do not hunt the light,*
> *Look where the dingoes are blind,*
> *Shadows hold the truth.*

The Haiku game. Semantic compression. Saying the most with the least.

My mind moves slowly, methodically, like clay being packed into a crack. Crossing out words. Subtracting Pokero's phrase from the Oath.

*Look, where, the, dingoes, do, not, hunt.*

Remove those syllables. What remains?

> **"Light are blind, shadows hold truth."**

Not just directions. A diagnosis.

*The Council (The Light) is blind to the reality of the collapse. The truth of the world is hiding in the shadows, and we must go there to protect it.*

The Click.

I feel it in my chest—a vibration, a resonance, the mechanical shifting of understanding. Pokero was playing the game. He made a move, years ago in that alley, and only now do I see the counter-move hidden in the negative space.

Far away, in the Violet Zone, Cooroo feels it too. The root-network carries the vibration—the Click of the cipher solving. He screams a check into the dawn. The echo returns changed.

I know where to go now. I understand the mission.

Not to save the Center. The Center is calcified, lost, addicted to its own Frequency.

To work in the shadows. To hold the edges. To find the places where the Dingoes don't hunt—the places where the spirit hasn't left, where the soil still breathes, where the Grout hasn't completely won.

To be the Living Root, not the Dead Branch.

I pick up my trowel. Adjust my vest. Walk into the dark, toward the next fracture, toward the next place that needs holding.

The work never ends. The weight never lightens.

But I am a wombat. And wombats endure.
