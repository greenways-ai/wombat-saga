# The Jacaranda Prophecy - Chapter 1 Image Prompts

## Prompt 1: Cooroo, the Silent Galah
**Scene:** Introduction to our protagonist

**Prompt:** 
A juvenile Galah (pink and grey cockatoo) perched on the jagged stump of a massive fallen tree, head cocked in contemplation. The bird has soft pink breast feathers, grey wings, and a distinctive crest. The stump is pale, fractured down the middle with a deep split, crystalline hexagonal patterns visible in the wood. Background shows the curved inner surface of a heart-shaped world rising in the distance. Golden-ember light from Elen-Nico (a distant star) illuminates the scene from above. Mood: melancholic, defiant, lonely. Style: fantasy illustration, detailed feather texture, atmospheric lighting.

---

## Prompt 2: The World of Hún Nico
**Scene:** Establishing the heart-shaped world

**Prompt:**
Wide landscape view of Hún Nico, a heart-shaped world viewed from the inside surface. The ground curves upward in all directions, creating a bowl-like interior that rises to meet at a distant geometric center. Elen-Nico hangs at the heart's center - a brilliant golden star radiating warm light in every direction. The inner surface is dotted with forests, ridges, and winding valleys. Another curved landmass is visible overhead, lit from the opposite side by the same star. Fantasy world-building, epic scale, impossible geometry, soft atmospheric perspective, luminous lighting.

---

## Prompt 3: The Failed Scream
**Scene:** Cooroo attempts the Noble Noise

**Prompt:**
Close-up of Cooroo with his beak wide open at the swell - the moment when every Galah in Hún Nico screams at Elen-Nico. But from his beak comes only a ghost, a whisper, the shape of a scream without the sound. Visualized as faint wisps of pinkish air instead of the bold resonance other Galahs emit. His crest is half-raised in effort, his eyes show confusion and fear. Background shows other distant Galahs screaming properly toward the center star. The light is the bright gold of the swell phase. Mood: shame, isolation, the wrongness of silence. Style: emotional character moment, soft lighting, visible breath/vapor trails.

---

## Prompt 4: The Shattered Silver Wattle
**Scene:** The fallen Coring Tree

**Prompt:**
The wreckage of an enormous ancient tree shattered into perfect hexagonal crystal fragments. Massive pale wood splinters have fractured into geometric hexagonal prisms, each face meeting at exactly 120 degrees. Some fragments are small as pebbles, others large as boulders. The break-face where the stump meets the air shows warm, hollow wood still faintly humming with lost resonance. Background: the Eastern Ridge landscape curving upward. Light: ember-red low phase of Elen-Nico. Style: detailed fantasy art, crystalline textures, tragic beauty, sharp geometric patterns contrasting with organic tree rings.

---

## Prompt 5: Cooriki on the Eucalyptus Branch
**Scene:** Cooroo's mother in her grief

**Prompt:**
An adult Galah with dusty, unkempt feathers sits motionless on a thin Eucalyptus branch, staring into the void where the great Silver Wattle once stood. Her posture is slumped, crest flat, eyes distant and unfocused. Behind her, empty space where the magnificent tree should be - just a pale stump visible in the distance. The branch she's on looks thin and insignificant compared to the missing tree. Light filters through sparse Eucalyptus leaves. Mood: catatonic grief, internal retreat, absence, the grey of lost memory. Style: somber, muted colors, soft focus background, emotional portrait.

---

## Prompt 6: The Bad Ground
**Scene:** The creeping crystallization

**Prompt:**
The Bad Ground - a slope covered entirely in interlocking hexagonal crystal lattice. Perfect hexagons tessellate in every direction without flaw or gap, each face a tiny mirror reflecting prismatic light. The pattern extends toward the viewer like a geometric glacier, marching up the ridge one cell at a time. Where the hexagons meet the living soil, there's a ragged, messy boundary - the organic layer fighting the geometric perfection. Elen-Nico's light catches the crystal surfaces, splitting into rainbow arcs. The beauty is wrong - like a skeleton, all structure and no flesh. Style: sci-fi/fantasy landscape, crystalline textures, beautiful but unsettling, perfect geometry vs organic mess.

---

## Prompt 7: The Lilac Pause
**Scene:** The moment between Elen-Nico's beats

**Prompt:**
The pause between beats - the entire inner surface of Hún Nico bathed in lilac light. The sky/star Elen-Nico hangs uncertain between gold and ember, radiating a color that is neither, something in-between. The curved world from Crown to Gorge glows violet-purple. A lone Galah (Cooroo) on the stump is silhouetted against this light, his natural pink and grey plumage transformed by the hue, his crest raised in instinctive response. The atmosphere feels held, breathless, waiting. The transition moment that defines Galah coloration. Style: ethereal lighting, violet palette, atmospheric, magical twilight.

---

## Prompt 8: Memory of the Rosella Chorus (Flashback)
**Scene:** The lost glory days

**Prompt:**
A memory vision of the Silver Wattle in full glory - a towering ancient tree with golden Wattle blooms, its branches filled with colorful Rosellas. The parrots have rainbow plumage - vivid reds, blues, greens, yellows. They appear like stained glass in the canopy. The tree's branches stretch toward Elen-Nico, conducting light and sound. A sense of harmony and chorus - visual suggestion of braided frequencies, color temperatures shifting in waves through the birds' feathers. The tree radiates health and resonance. Style: dreamlike, golden hour lighting, vibrant colors, nostalgic and mythic, slight glow effect.

---

## Prompt 9: The Swell Phase
**Scene:** Elen-Nico brightens

**Prompt:**
The Swell - Elen-Nico at the Heart of Nico flaring from ember-red to brilliant golden light. The pulse of the star-world spreading illumination across the curved inner surface of Hún Nico. Galahs across the landscape simultaneously turning toward the center and screaming - dozens of pink and grey birds with raised crests, beaks open in the Noble Noise. The moment of daily renewal when the world breathes in. Rays of gold light spreading outward like ripples. Style: epic fantasy moment, golden lighting, dynamic composition, sense of ritual and community.

---

## Prompt 10: Cookeerik's Fall
**Scene:** The legendary flight toward Elen-Nico

**Prompt:**
Old Cookeerik, an elder Galah with faded pink feathers, tumbling through nine kilometers of atmosphere after his wings failed near the Frequency Void. Above him, the impossibly distant Elen-Nico burning bright. Around him, the thinning air of the Law-Wind layer, feathers flattening unnaturally. His expression is not terror but transcendent wonder - he has seen what no bird should see. The curve of the heart-world below, getting closer. Style: dramatic vertical composition, sense of height and fall, atmospheric layers visible, sublime terror and beauty.

---

## Prompt 11: The Wattle's Death - Bark Cracking
**Scene:** Before the fall

**Prompt:**
Close-up of the Silver Wattle's bark in its final days - the surface cracking in precise hexagonal lines, not random splits but geometric patterns. The lattice underneath showing through like a skeleton pressing against skin. Golden Wattle blooms still coming, but looking ghostly against the crystallizing wood. Young Cooroo and Cooriki perched on a lower branch, Mum running frequency checks, her feathers showing "bad news." The wood rings flat and crystal when tapped. Style: body horror (botanical), transformation from organic to geometric, beautiful but deeply wrong, detailed bark texture.

---

## Prompt 12: The Snap - Tree Falling
**Scene:** The moment of destruction

**Prompt:**
The Silver Wattle falling - not falling but shattering. A massive tree breaking apart mid-air into crystalline fragments, hexagonal prisms flying in slow motion. The sound visualized as shockwaves radiating outward - every Galah for fifty kilometers reacting, every wombat in their tunnels feeling it in their paws. The moment when organic finally loses to geometric. The Eastern Ridge filled with the light of crystal fractures. Style: dramatic action moment, crystalline explosion, epic scale, catastrophic beauty, dynamic frozen moment.

---

## Prompt 13: Cooroo in the Wreckage
**Scene:** Counting angles, bleeding on crystal

**Prompt:**
Cooroo walking through the wreckage of the Silver Wattle, surrounded by hexagonal crystal fragments. He holds one perfect hexagonal prism in his claw, examining the 120-degree angles with obsessive precision. A thin line of blood runs from his claw where the crystal edge - sharper than any beak - has cut him. The blood sits on the crystal surface without soaking in, beading like water on glass. His expression is numb concentration. Background: the shattered stump and scattered geometry. Style: intimate character moment, sharp crystal edges, blood on perfection, emotional numbness.

---

## Prompt 14: The Frequency Void
**Scene:** Galah territory in the upper atmosphere

**Prompt:**
The Frequency Void (Lusta Ómëa) - the atmospheric layer where Galahs fly that is nearly airless, close to Elen-Nico. The space where sound becomes something felt in feathers rather than heard in ears. A Galah (implied to be Cookeerik in his youth) struggles through thinning air, wings working twice as hard for half the lift. The light from Elen-Nico is blindingly pure. Feathers shown vibrating with resonance. The curve of the world visible below, the Law-Wind layer a distinguishable boundary. Style: high-altitude atmospheric, thin air visual effect, pure light, struggle and transcendence.

---

## Prompt 15: The Empty Rosella Heights
**Scene:** Tundo Quessëa, the Feather-Hills

**Prompt:**
The Rosella Heights - Tundo Quessëa, the Feather-Hills north of the ridge - now completely empty. Stone outcrops and rocky hills where the Rainbow Parrots once held Parliament. White droppings still stain the stone, the only evidence they were ever here. The high branches they once claimed now bare. No birds, no Chorus, just silence and absence. The Eastern Ridge curving in the background. Style: empty landscape, melancholy, absence as presence, memorial without monuments, grey light.

---

## Prompt 16: The Rosellas' Departure
**Scene:** Scattering in different directions

**Prompt:**
The Rosellas leaving - different flocks flying in different directions from the Silver Wattle. One group heading south toward the Crystal Plains (Hyallapalar), drawn to geometric purity. Another group scattering west toward the Dry Channels and ancient riverbeds. A few brave ones heading far south to the Emu Steppe, where warriors patrol. Their rainbow feathers catching the light as they disperse, each carrying a fragment of the broken Chorus. The tree behind them already showing signs of crystallization. Style: dispersal, multiple directions, bright colors against greying background, end of an era.

---

## Prompt 17: The Lattice Song
**Scene:** The tone that broke the Rosellas

**Prompt:**
The Lattice Song rising through the Silver Wattle's wood - visualized as a single perfect geometric tone, crystalline and unwavering, climbing from roots to branches. The Rosellas in the high canopy hearing it, their feathers shifting color as they listen - reds going orange, blues going grey. Each bird finding their harmonic fragment matching the crystal tone, peeling away from the chord. The Song was supposed to synthesize, but this tone was already "resolved," already perfect. Visual metaphor: threads of a braid coming undone. Style: synesthetic visualization, sound as light/geometry, corruption of harmony, tragic seduction.

---

## Prompt 18: The Yellow Monsters
**Scene:** Omens from the Tall-Ones

**Prompt:**
Yellow Monsters flickering at the edge of vision - enormous spirit shapes like swinging arms and biting jaws, hallucinations that appear when the Tall-Ones' dreaming presses too hard against the substrate. These are warnings, omens of something bad coming. They appear at the periphery of the scene, barely there, causing birds and animals to brace and look around in fear. The creatures of Hún Nico know: you see one, you brace. Style: horror-tinged fantasy, glimpses of impossible giants, dreamlike unreality, golden-yellow flickering shapes, dread atmosphere.

---

## Prompt 19: Wombat Engineering
**Scene:** The Grout tunnels beneath

**Prompt:**
Cross-section view showing wombat tunnel construction beneath the Silver Wattle. Wombats pouring Grout - a concrete-like substance - in rigid straight lines through the substrate. Their paws working methodically, faces showing determination but not malice. The straight lines of Grout cutting through the organic, fractal root networks that protected the tree. Season after season of this work, shown as layers. The wombats don't explain themselves; they "note observations" and continue their well-intentioned destruction. Style: engineering diagram meets fantasy art, showing cause and effect, underground perspective, geological layers.

---

## Prompt 20: Cooroo Brings Seeds
**Scene:** Caring for his mother

**Prompt:**
Cooroo bringing dark-shelled seeds to his mother on the Eucalyptus branch. The seeds are fat, requiring effort to crack - but Cooriki won't bother with anything difficult, so he brings them anyway. She eats mechanically, without pleasure. Cooroo watches her with concern, his crest half-raised. The stump visible in the background between them. The routine of caregiving in the midst of grief. Twenty-one days of this. Style: intimate character moment, muted colors, routine and ritual, filial care, quiet tragedy.

---

## Prompt 21: Cooroo Roosting on the Stump
**Scene:** Keeping the vigil

**Prompt:**
Cooroo roosting on the uneven, hard surface of the Silver Wattle stump at night. The dim phase - Elen-Nico low and ember-red. The stump is uncomfortable, nothing like the branches he grew up on, but leaving would mean admitting it's over. He huddles against the fractured crystal, his pink and grey feathers catching the red light. Around him, the wasteland of hexagonal fragments. He is alone, stubborn, refusing to let the vigil end. Style: night scene, ember-red lighting, solitude, stubborn hope, uncomfortable perch.

---

## Prompt 22: The Galah Colony Scattered
**Scene:** Those who left

**Prompt:**
Various groups of Galahs flying away from the Eastern Ridge to different destinations. Callers heading south to the Canopy Remnant - Aldar Lemnë, scattered clusters of surviving Eucalyptus. Fliers heading to the Windbreak Cliffs - Ramba Súrëa, rough sandstone caves pockmarked and too rough for the lattice. Others flying around the back of the heart, past the Lone Borows where the ground is scrubby. Cooroo watches them go from the stump, his wings too young for the distance. Style: migration, dispersal, multiple destinations, youth left behind, community fracturing.

---

## Prompt 23: The Three Primes Broken
**Scene:** The decay of sacred order

**Prompt:**
Triptych showing the Three Primes in their decline. Left: Kangaroos running endless violent circuits, their Friction Engine driving nothing but conflict - "muscles without purpose." Center: Koalas in drugged stupor among Lyptus leaves, their alchemical Silence corrupted into narcotic escape - "Quiet that stops thought." Right: Empty ripples in water where Platypus should be - the Paradox that couldn't exist in a binary world - "vanished, not dead, because 'where' may not be the question." Above all, crystallization spreading. Style: symbolic triptych, dark fantasy, showing decay of order, contrasting panels.

---

## Prompt 24: The Organic/Crystal Boundary
**Scene:** Where life meets geometry

**Prompt:**
Extreme close-up of the boundary between living soil and the Bad Ground. On one side: tangled roots, insects, moisture, organic mess - fractal, rough, alive. On the other: perfect hexagonal crystal cells, tessellating infinitely, prismatic, dead. The line between them is ragged, messy, still fighting - a few centimeters of organic mess holding back the pattern. Individual root hairs penetrating crystal fissures, individual crystal cells converting soil. The war at the smallest scale. Style: macro photography style, microscopic warfare, organic vs geometric textures, detailed natural textures.

---

## Prompt 25: The Morning Glory
**Scene:** Discovery at the edge of the Bad Ground

**Prompt:**
A delicate Morning Glory vine growing at the ragged edge where crystalline Bad Ground meets living soil. The vine is thin as wire with three bright green heart-shaped leaves. It climbs a fragment of the shattered Silver Wattle wood. At its top, a single trumpet-shaped flower blooms - the color of concentrated sky, lilac/violet, the exact shade of the pause between Elen-Nico's beats. The flower glows with an inner light against the grey hexagonal crystal background. The contrast is striking - soft organic curves against perfect geometric hexagons, living color against crystalline grey, hope against despair. Macro photography style, fantasy illustration, luminous petals, detailed texture, symbolic composition.

---

## Prompt 26: The Signal - The Vine Speaks
**Scene:** Communication through resonance

**Prompt:**
Cooroo squatting before the lilac Morning Glory flower, crest raised in surprise. Visual representation of resonance flowing from the flower into the bird - perhaps as soft light threads or vibrations in the air. The flower's petals seem to emit a direction, an arrow of light pointing south-east. Cooroo's feathers are ruffled, catching the color, his resonating chambers in his skull depicted as softly glowing. The vine's roots visible threading into cracks in the crystal Wattle fragment beneath - thin roots finding fissures in the perfect hexagons. Magical realism style, ethereal lighting, sense of communication beyond words.

---

## Prompt 27: Cooroo's Crest
**Scene:** Instinctive response

**Prompt:**
Close-up of Cooroo's head showing his crest - the feather crest that "has opinions and doesn't consult him." The crest is fully raised, responding to the lilac flower before Cooroo consciously decides to react. Detail of the pink and grey feather patterns, the distinctive Galah coloration. Behind him, slightly out of focus, the lilac Morning Glory. The image emphasizes the Galah's instinctive, feather-based cognition - how birds know things through feather-feeling before thought. Style: portrait, detailed feather texture, soft background, character detail, intimate.

---

## Prompt 28: The Direction - South-East
**Scene:** The call to journey

**Prompt:**
Cooroo looking south-east from the stump, the Morning Glory's signal still resonating in his feathers. The landscape curves upward in that direction - past the Ridge, past the Burnt Scrub, toward the distant Gorge where living stone meets crystal. The journey ahead seems impossible for his young wings. But somewhere in the Lone Borow territory, beyond the map's end, something violet is blooming. The light shows the way - a subtle violet tint in the air pointing the direction. Style: epic landscape, journey beginning, impossible distance, hope against odds, atmospheric perspective.

---

## Prompt 29: The Act of Transfer
**Scene:** Cooroo accepts his mission

**Prompt:**
Cooroo gripping the Morning Glory vine in his claws, preparing to take flight. The delicate lilac flower and its trailing roots are clutched carefully against his grey and pink body. Behind him, the wreckage of the Silver Wattle stump and the Bad Ground stretching into distance. Before him, the curving landscape of Hún Nico rising toward the distant horizon, suggesting the long journey ahead to the Lone Borow territory. His posture is determined despite his youth and small size. The first rays of the swell phase illuminate the scene with golden-pink light. Style: heroic fantasy, small protagonist facing epic quest, warm hopeful lighting, detailed botanical elements.

---

## Prompt 30: The First Scream
**Scene:** Cooroo's voice returns

**Prompt:**
Cooroo on the Silver Wattle stump, beak wide open in a raw, cracked scream - his first sound in five weeks. Sound waves visualized radiating outward in jagged, ungraceful patterns - nothing like the Noble Noise, everything like raw determination. His crest is fully erect, feathers fluffed, whole body engaged in the effort. The scream travels upward toward distant Elen-Nico, curving through the heart-shaped atmosphere. In the background, barely visible on a Eucalyptus branch 300 meters away, another Galah (his mother Cooriki) turns her head, crest beginning to rise. The light is the lilac pause between beats. Style: dramatic moment, dynamic composition, visualized sound, emotional breakthrough, dawn light.

---

## Prompt 31: Cooriki Hears
**Scene:** The mother's response

**Prompt:**
Cooriki on her Eucalyptus branch, 300 meters away. She has been catatonic for twenty-one days, lost in internal memory of the Glory Days. But now - she turns her head toward the sound of her son's terrible, graceless scream. Her crest is rising, her eyes showing the first crack in her internal sanctuary. She doesn't fly yet, but she turns. The scream was so imperfect, so jagged, that it broke through where perfection couldn't reach. Small things are how big things start. Style: distant view, subtle character moment, beginning of awakening, hope emerging from grief, soft focus.

---

## Prompt 32: "The Sky Doesn't Leave"
**Scene:** Galah philosophy

**Prompt:**
Artistic composition showing the concept: "We Galahs are what happens when the God-Kind squeezes the sky. The sky doesn't leave. Neither do we." Visual metaphor of pink and grey Galahs against the curved sky of Hún Nico, which bends upward and wraps around them like cupped hands. The birds are small but stubborn, refusing to depart even as the world changes. Elen-Nico burns above. The image captures the stubbornness that defines the species - not noble, not purposeful, just present. Style: symbolic composition, philosophical, atmospheric, cosmic and intimate combined.

---

## Bonus: Cover Image Concept
**Scene:** The essence of the story

**Prompt:**
Epic book cover composition: A juvenile Galah in flight, small against the vast heart-shaped world of Hún Nico, carrying a glowing lilac Morning Glory flower in his claws. The curved inner surface of the world rises behind him, Elen-Nico burning at the geometric center. Below, the Silver Wattle stump and the spreading crystalline Bad Ground. Above, the suggestion of the distant Jacaranda with violet blooms somewhere on the curving horizon. The color palette is dominated by pinks, greys, lilacs, and golds. Tagline space at top: "Only the Galahs stayed." Style: epic fantasy book cover, cinematic lighting, sense of impossible scale, hope amid desolation.
